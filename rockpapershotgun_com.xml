            <p>Waking up at the crack of dawn today, I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices did not have a comments thread in which to badger us to play Troubleshooter Colon Abandoned Children. I burst from the covers, ran weeping to my PC (this happens most mornings, to be fair) and discovered that I had forgotten to finish the intro for our latest What Are We All Playing This Weekend article. And now I have. So, what are you all playing this weekend?</p><!--more-->
<p><strong>Jeremy</strong><br>I've come down with a bit of a cold, so it's highly likely that this weekend will mostly be spent in bed trying to recover from the whirlwind of house repairs and other chaos that has dominated life since October. I shall resume my hunts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy XII</a> and let the auto-battling Gambit system take over for me, most likely. Go on, my brave Ivalice squad - kill some things while I shuffle your macros from behind the scenes in order to alleviate the aches in my bones!</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>This is like turning up to a biker bar and loudly announcing you’ve bought a vintage Volvo, but I picked up an old PS3 on eBay this week purely so I could play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns Of The Patriots. I’m sorry, PC brethren. I’m one of you, I promise! But I’ve given up hope they’re ever freeing this game from its PS3 prison, and paid my way to spending the weekend hiding in cardboard boxes and doing cool spy shit. Well, I’ll do that for 10 minutes before Kojima wrestles me down and forces me to watch my fifth subsequent feature-length movie masquerading as a cutscene.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong><br>Right, so Raceroom has just gotten a new car pack featuring the Mercs, Audis and Opels of the 2002 DTM series. As you might have read in the RPS 100, I love me some German touring cars, so you’ll probably find me blasting around Hockenheim or the Norisring in a pitched battle with Bernd Schneider, Laurent Aiello or Manuel Reuter this weekend.</p><p><strong>Ollie:</strong><br>It's been a rough time for me recently. My anxiety has been hitting me so hard that I feel like half a person. So this weekend, I'll be splitting my time between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a>, and a couple of hours stroking some of my favourite cats in the nearby cat cafe. And all three of those activities will be shared with some of my favourite people in the world. Hopefully together it can help soothe my frayed nerves.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong><br>I continue to enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-hours-of-tweaker-gunslinging-and-trench-warfare-im-sold-on-darktides-imminent-hive-scum-update">Hive Scumming</a> around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. Myself and a couple of friends have formed a shouty little triumvirate of mohawked wrong'uns, each specialising in one of the three pillars of grimdark hoodlum combat doctrine: guns, knives, and methamphetamine.</p>
<p><strong>Julian</strong><br>After a week of working perhaps too many 7am - 11pm days, I'm relaxing by going to an 11pm - 7am Wong Kar Wai marathon. As such, I have no plans to play games this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin</strong><br>I'm spending time with my partner this weekend, then I'm off for three days helping my dad with a house move. I might find some time for a go at Total Chaos, the new horror game from the Turbo Overkill developer. Although I've played a lot of horror games recently. Maybe I'll read a book? Maybe I'll read some books recommended by a game developer, even?</p>

<p><em>And you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...</em>
