What do people that play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> call themselves, frostpunks? Feels too obvious, but I'm going to do it anyway. Breaking news frostpunks! There's a new big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> update that's just arrived in the game, adding some pretty big additions and changes,so let's jump into them. First up, The Pit! No, it's not just some hole to chuck things in, it's a large new map with a "distinctive 'proto-crater' pit counted as mountain terrain," to be found within.
</p>

<p>
The heating system has seen a big overhaul too. Described as the "biggest systemic change since launch", this one localises heat management to individual districts. Each district can apparently have "unique" effects, as well as consequences if you're failing to keep places warm. There's a new heatmap view too so you can see how each district is doing temperature.

Serenity mode from the first game is back with this update, a good one for frostpunks that don't like stress. There's gentler weather, way more resources, shorter whiteouts, and the fervour system is completely gone, meaning no conflict between factions and very few protests.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new challenges in-game too, all of which apparently introduce a "unique quest and storyline. Multiple Tales can be combined in a single playthrough. Complete a Tale to unlock a unique Monument Hub to “decorate” your city, but be careful: failure results in game over!"
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has received a few other tweaks to smooth things over as well, like a rebalanced prologue, improved tutorials, city visuals showing a denser population, alongside other changes. Modding tools are out of beta now, adding in features like a search bar, improved loading times, and tutorials.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> go into a lot more detail about the minutiae changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498320947205373969?l=english">Steam post</a>, if you're looking for all the nitty gritty bits. There they also promised that alongside future DLC, they are "committed" to releasing more free big updates for Frostpunk 2, all while they work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-isnt-a-threequel-or-a-spin-off-but-a-remake-of-the-original">recently announced Frostpunk 1886</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games have confirmed, and look, here’s a trailer featuring much headlong bloodshed in the villas, citrus groves and *squints* mysterious firelit dungeons of early 20th century Sicily.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> now releasing in 2026, the new Mafia is the criminal enterprise to beat this year. Rather than trying to fill the hole left by the Rockstar colossus, it’s playing things small with “a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay,” according to Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes.

As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Eurogamer</a>, 2K Games and parent company Take Two Interactive are positioning the new Mafia as a side dish for the enormous live service productions that have become triple-A publishing's stock in trade.
</p>
<p>
“We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments,” said 2K president David Ismailer in a release. “We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p>
<p>Good lord, I remember when accidentally uttering the word “linear” in a press release or interview for a big-budget action game was the kiss of death. You’d find torch-waving gamer mobs at your gates the next day. That era has passed below the horizon: we are older now, and full of woe. We crave the sweet succinctness of a mildly interactive corridor.
</p>
<p>
It’s definitely a tapdance, openly selling your game as a “complement” for other games - possibly the devs at Hangar 13 find the language here a bit condescending. My somewhat more depressing analysis is that The Old Country is effectively being offered as a holiday from those games. You've done your time at the seasonal content coalface, so off you go to Sicily for some highly scripted R&amp;R.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m less bothered by questions of length than by the fact that The Old Country seems quite formulaic and lumbering. Guy shoots guy. Guy shoots guy while hunkered down behind table. Guy drives car very fast. Guy stabs guy. I do like the environments, though – hopefully, Hangar 13 have baked in plenty of opportunity to just wander through the groves looking at lemons and whatnot.
