            <p>
I do have to admit that bringing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> feels like digging up a dead dog that perished in a horrendous, preventable accident, but it feels important given how quickly it died and what the means for how we engage with it. You see, it seems that this week the largely panned hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was revived through community-run custom servers. Except it seems like this may be over before it truly begins.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/">The Game Post</a>, developers that go by the names Red, open_wizard, and gwog opened up a Discord server where you could try out Concord through said custom servers. This is apparently possible through the trio recreating the game's backend API and thusly reverse engineering it. Some videos were even posted to YouTube showing off these custom servers in action, which is where things have started to go legally iffy.
</p>
<p>
Both videos, as again reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, were taken down through a copyright claim filed by MarkScan Enforcement, most likely on Sony's behalf. I say most likely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightmare-kart-is-getting-a-free-dlc-but-sonys-plague-ridden-rats-have-come-for-bloodborne-psx">as MarkScan did the exact same thing to Bloodborne PSX</a> on behalf of Sony earlier this year. It's not surprising the same thing has been done to Concord here, especially as the custom servers won't have much legal ground to stand on.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that these takedowns are for the videos themselves. So far nothing seems to have been done about the custom servers themselves, but in a statement in the Discord for the project, developer Red said "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being." At the time of writing, any links to the Discord server no longer work.
</p><p>
This all feels pertinent to the ongoing situation with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">Stop Killing Games</a>, a campaign that seeks to "challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." Personally, I don't love the consumerist angle to the campaign, but there is something to be said of the need to protect online-only games from certain doom. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Concord are toys, you smash action figures together in them for ridiculous results, yet you can only do it in the way you've been told to. That stinks! I often think of the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> in particular, and the playful space Valve created with it that allowed for many a machinima. That feels like more important a reason to preserve online games, to allow for a freer sense of play once the corporate overlords have stopped making money from their toy business. Let's see how things play out for new, slightly less legal Concord.

            <p>
The leads behind the, potentially surprisingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-superhero-comedy-dispatch-a-million-selling-success-story-it-could-be-that-weekly-release-schedule">hit superhero game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, AdHoc Studio, have been all over the place. Telltale Games, Ubisoft, Night School Studio, some pretty notable names, but today we're honing in on their time at Ubisoft in particular. That's because a recent report that dives into the long story that led AdHoc to making Dispatch revealed that before doing so, they were working on a completely new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> game at Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
Nick Herman, one of the co-founders of AdHoc, shared said detail with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, saying that he was "so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while. And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love." Obviously this game never materialised, and according to Herman it was partially due to the whims of executives at the time.
</p>
<p>
This was back in 2017, a time when Ubisoft was gaining interest in live service games, and so this new Splinter Cell game just didn't fit into that vision. "We tried," Herman said. "Let’s make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made." Nothing they did try worked, apparently, but eventually it somehow morphed into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">xDefiant</a>, though this was post the AdHoc team forming.
</p>
<p>
If you need a reminder, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">xDefiant was shut down only a year after it was released</a>, resulting in mass layoffs. It also started life as a Tom Clancy game, so you can see the Splinter Cell connection at least.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that xDefiant producer Mark Rubin commented on his personal Dwitter account regarding this report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122">claiming it wasn't true</a>, and that the shooter had never started life as a Splinter Cell game. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5oad3lxlc25">as pointed by the author of said Bloomberg report Jason Schreier</a>, Rubin joined Ubisoft in 2019, two years after the Dispatch team was working on Splinter Cell. So, yes, the folks that made Dispatch were working on a Splinter Cell game once upon a time, as long as nobody is lying to us, and if they are, please don't shoot me (the fabled messenger).
