            <p>Nacon - publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - have announced that they've filed for insolvency. The French company say they've asked for "judicial reorganisation proceedings" to kick off, with the goal of finding ways to keep the business going, "protect employees, and preserve jobs" while renegotiating with creditors.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this has been announced by Nacon via <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">press release</a> today, February 25th. "On February 20th 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the publishers wrote.</p>
<p>As a result, Nacon said, "rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors" is necessary to try and keep the company going. So, in filing for insolvency, Nacaon's aim it to allow themselves time to "assess all possible solutions" to make sure they can carry on operating in a manner judged to be sustainable, "protect employees", and "preserve jobs". In the meantime, the publishers will be "renegotiating with...creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p>
<p>"This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan," Nacon summarised, adding that organisations representing its employees - that would include unions - were informed on February 24th that these decisions had been made.</p>
<p>A court's expected to rule on Nacon's request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings in early March, and in the interim the company's share price will remain suspended.</p>
<p>In recent years, Nacon have published the likes of goblin stealther Styx: Blades of Greed, robo copper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/robocop-rogue-city-review">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and critically panned racer Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. They spent a long time publishing Solar Crown devs KT Racing's pretty good WRC rally games, and recently <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">re-acquired the series' license from 2027 onwards</a> after EA decided Codemasters should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">just stop making their own very good rally games</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nacon announced <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/NACON-CONNECT-IS-BACK-ON-MARCH-4-2026">a showcase</a> set to take place on March 4th. That still looks set to go ahead and will feature updates on Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series - potentially alongside announcements of new games.</p>
<p>Solidarity to workers at Nacon during what I'm sure are stressful times.</p>
