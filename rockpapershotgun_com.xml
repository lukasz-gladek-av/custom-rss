            <p>It's been long enough since I last played an Ace Combat game that I can remember only two things about Ace Combat. 1) This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXB1W8va3eg">Ace Combat 7 cutscene</a> featuring what appears to be a wavy JPEG of a dog, which the Twitterati all thought was an exasperated animator's joke, but which I understand is <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Cossette%27s_dog">actually a homage to a real staff member's dog</a> who died before the game's release. And 2) you can 'powerslide' by wilfully initiating a stall, which I think might actually be a move from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-haw-10">Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</a>.</p>
<p>Delivery Must Complete sort of builds a whole subgenre around the thrill of powersliding planes. How does it do this? The clue is that "DMC" is also an abbreviation of "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>". Here's a trailer. I promise you there will be no further confusing/upsetting references to dogs.</p><!--more-->

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/">The Steam page</a> calls it "a high speed Acelike Roguelike with SSSTYLE", featuring cell-shaded, upgradeable jet fighters, four procedural locations, and an enemy roster that includes blimps, dragons and mechs. The story blurb suggests that your overall goal is to make a delivery. What's the return postage cost for an exploded Sidewinder these days?</p><p>In Delivery Must Complete, you will: parry missiles, fire bouncy projectiles out of railguns, deal with varying cloud cover, boggle at fantastical terrain flourishes such as floating islands, build a style meter, and call in orbital strikes. You will not: have limited ammo, though you do have to worry about overheating.

<p>It's the work of Melbourne, Australia-based developer and <a href="https://yoyoyollie.itch.io/">gamejam enthusiast</a> Yoyoyollie. There's no release date yet. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ae2501maeth.bsky.social/post/3lyybxmphtc2o">ae2501maeth</a> for noticing. I've been in the mood for a firmly non-simulatory flight sim for a while and this looks like just the thing, though I do have to flag up its mystifying shortage of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">brewing mechanics</a>.</p>

            <p>
From an outside perspective, I think it was probably fairly obvious that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> was never going to do very well. There was barely any game to show off, so they mostly didn't. What they did show didn't look very good either, and when it came out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-launches-to-clips-of-atvs-glitchily-spaghettifying-a-bloke-named-seb-but-a-patch-is-on-the-way">it was a glitchy mess</a>. This all put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-director-reportedly-says-the-studio-will-relaunch-the-game-as-around-300-staff-are-at-risk-of-being-laid-off">300 staff members at risk of being laid off</a>, the full extent of which still being not particularly clear. And in a recent interview, the game's lead actor Alex Hernandez has shared his own experience of being the face of the game (spoiler alert: it's not great).
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hKUUUpUZQOt0HARxTlpvl">FRVR Podcast</a>, Hernandez spoke of what it was like having his face attached to such a mess of a game, quite plainly saying, "It's hard. I'm not gonna lie about that. It’s a difficult thing to spend two-and-a-half years on a project that you’re really proud of and you’re proud of your contribution to it… for the 300 or so employees at Build A Rocket Boy, you're like 'I hope this goes really well.' I want them all to get raises and have a giant party and have this be the job that launches their career."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the more upsetting thing to hear Hernandez say was how his name will "now be associated with something that many people have regarded as pretty f*****g bad. And as an artist, as a man, as a gamer, that hurts, it's wildly painful." This is an aspect of an increased use of motion and facial capture we're not really thinking of.
</p>
<p>
My best guess is that actors' real faces are being used more and more to help get better and more believable in-game performances (those who know better feel free to sound off in the comments). The trade-off here is that you are then thrusting some of these actors into the spotlight, one which features a community that, as many of us know, isn't always the kindest, and I am putting that as politely as possible.
</p><p>
Personally, I always prefer a tightly designed character over motion capture anyway - even if I did enjoy getting a first-person perspective of Mads Mikkelsen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> - but perhaps there's yet another lesson to be learned here in the need for safeguards to be put in place for the people that are being put at the front of high profile games.
