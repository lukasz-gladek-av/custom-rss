<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab have taken issue with an imitation of their game created in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">100% non-problematic</a> kiddy funhouse sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, saying that they'd prefer people pirate their creation than play its predatory WonkoVision double.

<p>

"tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff," reads <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">the social media post in question</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Roblox imitation is called Cliff, and is the work of PewStudio, who do acknowledge Peak as an inspiration on the store page, with the nonchalance of cereal manufacturers letting you know that your breakfast may contain a non-zero quantity of paperclips. As explored by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">Eurogamer</a>, everything from the title art through the lobby area to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">the co-op clambering mechanics</a> is flagrantly redolent of the Aggro Crab hit. The major difference is that it looks relatively naff and is thickly garnished with microtransactions.

I can understand Aggro Crab's ire, though I do enjoy the vague deference of naming the clone for a geological formation you'd expect to find lower down the mountainside. I mean, they could have called it Summit. I also have a guilty affection for the uncanny aesthetics of such cash-grab knock-offs. I always drink plenty of... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovfM7dvFto0">malk</a>?
</p>
<p>
Roblox teems with clones. If you have made a successful video game, its ruined double doubtless exists somewhere in the Roblands. For some developers this is a serious barrier to prosperity, and for others, it is an irritation. Peak has sold over <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/how-peak-sold-45m-copies-in-less">4.5 million copies</a> as of July - I can't imagine either Roblox clones or cathartic/vengeful piracy will make much difference to Aggro Crab's finances at this stage. If you're a Peak player, by the way, you might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">these skeletons</a>.
