            <p>
The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it's sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

If you see anything paranormal, scoot on back to the factory floor and hit the red button to condemn the structure. If the building appears normal, press the green one (you won't, seemingly, have to worry about other habit certification requirements, such as checking that all the kitchens have fire blankets - different department, I guess). In the event of a haunting, the predictable complication is that the spooks might not let you leave. Quite why your employer keeps accidentally building haunted houses remains to be seen. Where exactly do they get the logs for those walls?
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Cabin Factory partly because it could be an amazing prank. Maybe none of the cabins harbour ghosts! Perhaps the whole thing is a vicious social experiment on the part of developers International Cat Studios, to see how many players can be induced to imagine supernatural antics. 
</p><p>
It would be a neat way to save development resources with regard to ghoulish lighting effects, fraught violin soundtracks and such. Perhaps other self-described "horror" games could follow their example. Imagine a Silent Hill game in which Silent Hill is a perfectly unremarkable town, haunted only by the spectres players bring in with them. Hang on, isn't that what Silent Hill is anyway?
</p>
<p>
The other thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is the precise level of eerieness that separates a haunted house from a house that just has a lot of shoddy wiring and ill-fitting carpentry. What kinds of layout, atmospheric elements, and special effects will they introduce that provoke alarm but do not kindle the certainty of an eldritch infestation? How do you tune, say, a creaking floorboard so that it sounds almost like the footfall of a poltergeist but, on reflection, is probably just a creaking floorboard? What species of rising damp looks almost, but not entirely like the Babadook?
</p>
<p>

The third thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is that it could be a commentary on game testing. It gives International Cat Studios a certain leeway when it comes to glitches - that's interference from beyond the grave, not a misbehaving shader! I wonder if there's any odds of a licensed multiplayer mode where they wheel on houses from other, unfinished games and have you comb them for frame-rate drops styled as phantom interventions, using a PKE Meter that actually just shows you a graph of CPU activity.
</p>
<p>
The Cabin Factory is out 13th December. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/">read more on Steam</a>. The obvious movie pairing here is Cabin In The Woods.

            <p>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesnâ€™t get you very far, at least you put in an honest dayâ€™s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that donâ€™t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.</p>
<p>Also, coincidentally, all things you can do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3128740/Beff_Jezos_Simulator/">in the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beff-jezos-simulator">Beff Jezos Simulator</a>. Now, work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation games</a> arenâ€™t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?</p>

<p>In this wonderful fantasy allegory - like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> but for people who, when they say 'let them cook,' they are preparing to slurp a stew made entirely of boot - you can also perform these premium fantasy billionaire activities:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fulfill Orders Efficiently: Pack items quickly and accurately, manage customer service, and keep satisfaction high!</li>
<li>Grow Your Business: Hire a skilled team, expand packaging stations, and even open a warehouse as demand soars.</li>
<li>Upgrade Your Skills: Unlock powerful abilities like bulk shipping, advanced sales insights, and marketing strategies through a rich skill tree!</li>
<li>Real-World E-Commerce Mechanics: Face real challenges like inventory management, pricing strategies, and keeping customers happy.</li>
<li>Adapt to Market Trends: Stock popular items and adjust quickly to shifts in demand to keep profits high.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m not spotting anything about buying entire media outlets to gradually influence public opinion into thinking bald divorced men with all the basic empathy of a mouldy satsuma are actually extremely fuckable and cool, but Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s in there somewhere too.</p>
<p>What would you do if you were a billionaire, reader? I would buy the world a copy of Beff Jezos Simulator <em>and</em> a really lovely bottle to piss in. Wide rimmed. Sturdy. Leak-proof. The works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is expanding yet again with 12 new subclasses, including drunk monks, teleporting beekeepers and shadow sorcerors]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors.1047210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch 7 would be their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-update-will-be-larians-final-handover-to-players">final handover to players</a> of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two currently untitled new game projects</a>. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.</p>
<p>The subclasses in question are a fanciful bunch. Take Drunken Master for the Monk class, which lets you intoxicate enemies and then rapidly sober them up to inflict physical and psychic damage. As a Ranger Swarmkeeper, meanwhile, you can wield a "legion of bees" like a battering ram and then teleport to the swarm's location to stick the boot in. The Fighter's Arcane Archer subclass lets you temporarily banish people to another dimension, the Cleric's Dark Domain lets you blow up corpses, and the Rogue's Swashbuckler gets to flick sand in faces, jolt weapons from hands and generally speaking just wind adversaries up. Fire up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735?l=english">the Steam announcement post</a> for the full list.</p>
<p>As for the new photo mode, this gives you a bunch of lens settings such as FOV and focus level, together with scene settings such as the ability to toggle off either party members, NPCs and enemies. It also lets you choose facial expressions and pick from around 40 static and animated poses, each with variations. There are also post-processing effects such as contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignetting, and a choice of frames and stickers.</p>
<p>The sweetener is full cross-play functionality with full cross-platform progression. No longer will that Xbox player you know have to play Baldur's Gate 3 solo. You'll be able to invite them into your game and, as the case may be, cover them in angry bees. </p>
<p>There's no release date for the patch just yet, but Larian are doing early public "stress-testing" in early January. You'll be able to register your interest beforehand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Let's face it, nothing important happens in December. I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.
</p>
<p>The games that slipped are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

<p>I enjoyed the in memoriam section for games that released this year which can therefore no longer be delayed, all of which are currently available at a discount via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital/sale/autumnsale2024">Devolver's autumn sale on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Baby Steps is the pick of the Delayed Three that I'm most looking forward to. It's a literal walking simulator from Bennett Foddy and the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a> in which you pilot limbs individually to steer your pyjama-clad protagonist up a mountain, like a marriage between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>, and whichever third-person game with a mountain you care to choose from. Skyrim? Jusant? I bet God Of War's got a mud-soaked hill in it somewhere.
</p><p>Skate Story is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater if Tony Hawk was a demon made out of glass. Stick It To The Stickman is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4wzwYeZ0Y">Flash animation you watched 20 years ago</a> but with a physics simulation and made by the Broforce developers. I want to play both of these games, too.
</p>
<p>Check out the graphic design on these bad boys. The blurriness on the image of the mini roll isn't my camera, that's actually how it looks on the box.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a> prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slipways-review">polished to a fine shine in its full release</a>.
</p>
<p>All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can play Solitomb in <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">your browser for free right now</a>. 
</p>
<p>Hit the how-to-play button in-game to <a href="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/12080108/tutorial/index.html">go to this webpage</a>, which is the basic tutorial. If you've played solitaire before, the very basics are familiar: there are stacks of cards spread at the top of the screen, with some facing upwards. After that just about everything else is different.
</p><p>The cards themselves represent either the different types of monster you can fight, or the attack, shield, and potions you can take into that fight. The number on each card represents its efficacy. You build stacks of up to five cards - any lower numbered card can be placed on top of another - and drag them into your hand to start the fight. The aim is to defeat a certain number of a certain kind of enemy or to clear a pathway forward in order to reach the next level of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Which probably all sounds a little abstract, but makes sense almost as soon as you start playing. Want to defeat a beast of five strength? Pair it with a sword of five strength. Want to win the fight without taking damage? Add a shield of 4 strength and a potion of 1 or higher, and drag all four cards together into your hand. Now do this again and again to clear all the cards in front of you, making sure not to squader power on lesser battles, to run out of health, or to run out of attack cards altogether.
</p>
<p>There are umpteen other systems layered atop this basic combat math. The dungeon houses an impatient demon and if you make too many dragging and stacking moves before you trigger combat, you'll start to take damage. There are damage bonuses for combos, such as cards of the same suit, rank or consecutive ranks. You choose a character class before a run, with a passive buff and a special ability, and there's a between-level shop for purchasing new cards and upgrades. Later floors introduce new card types. Prototype or not, it already seems rich in strategic potential.
</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">the Solitomb page on Itch to give it a try</a>. Or if you never got around to trying Slipways, you can pick that for half price right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264280/Slipways/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
