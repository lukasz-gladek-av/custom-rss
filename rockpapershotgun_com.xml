            <p>You need to buck your ideas up and start doing better. No, it's not what your parents say whenever you tell them what you're up to for a living, it's what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are basically telling players with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s latest major order.</p>
<p>Get out there with those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station">stabby flags</a> and murder-death millions of the enemies Super Earth's citizens are most afraid of, in order to restore their faith in your ability to protect them by murder-deathing things. It's not all tough love, though. There's also another free cape for folks who helped solve a puzzle in May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The relentless assault on Managed Democracy is taking its toll on our citizens' sense of well-being," reads the fresh order that just gone live in the game, "Surveys indicate that citizens fears of invasion, disenfranchisement, and dismemberment of loved ones is at an all-time high." I mean, given the divers' efforts to defend the Democracy Space Station from the Automatons in the previous mission ended in defeat, you can see how we got to this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p>So, Super Earth's bigwigs have ordered the creation of three new "Maximum Security Cities" dubbed Fort Union, Fort Sanctuary, and Emeria. The names aren't quite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">as catchy as gun</a>, but you can't have everything, I suppose. That's clearly not enough thinly veiled and chuckle-worthy satire, though, so this latest order tasks folks with killing millions of the enemies that "arise most frequently in citizen nightmares", as part of a galaxy-brain PR campaign.</p> <div>

<p>Break out the Big Smoke memes, because the order calls for 20 million Shriekers, 12.5 million Impalers, 6.25 million Factory Striders, 7.5 million Fleshmobs, and 3.75 million Leviathans to be splattered across space. It's a big mix of bugs, bots, and Illuminate squids to murder-death, so even a player base that's notoriously efficient at racking up big kill numbers might struggle.</p>
<p>Lucky then that Arrowhead gifted another free cape to players this morning. Rather than commemorating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">some review bombing</a>, this one's dubbed the Ingress-81 cape and is a reward for folks who took part in the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-next-big-galactic-war-twist-looks-kicking-off-with-huge-station-81-tease-livestream">Station-81 alternate reality game</a> Arrowhead ran via Helldivers 2's Discord back in May.

            <p>
EA and DICE have decided to let players choose between locking weapons to classes in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, or being able to equip any weapon to any class. It might sound like a throwaway technicality, next to the existential terror of reports that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want the new shooter to find a following of 100 million players</a>. In practice, the decision to give players the option of locking weapons to classes is Serious Business. it's the latest manifestation of a debate that goes back to Battlefield's formative squabbles with rival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> Call Of Duty in the noughties.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
First, the what, when and how. Battlefield 6 is currently in beta via the Battlefield Labs program, a program that is in theory clandestine but in practice, has proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam%22%22">leekier than a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup</a>. Oh sorry, that's me reminiscing about lunch. I mean: leakier than a colander that has been used as a helmet... possibly after being used to make a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup - we can't confirm at the time of reporting. 
</p>
<p>
Among other things, we've been treated to sneaky early glimpses of the game's classes: recon, assault, engineer and support. The restoration of something like Battlefield's old class system is welcome tidings indeed for those who hated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">Battlefield 2042's Specialists</a> - a group of wonky named characters equipped with customisable loadouts, plus a unique speciality and trait. 
</p>
<p>
However, EA spiked the enthusiasm some by revealing that while each Battlefield 6 class will have a "signature weapon" that gives them specific bonuses, any class can use any weapon. This being a bid "to have the interconnected systems and fundamentals of each class shape their role, while granting the freedom to customize how to execute that role," as detailed on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1943692970106269912">MechaHitler.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
EA's reasoning has bred a backlash, with players complaining that this is just the old Specialist system wearing a different shade of khaki - and now, EA have relented. "Open Weapons vs Closed Weapons," declares a new post on the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">Muskvine</a>. "Why not both? Starting at Open Beta players can choose official playlists with Signature Weapons locked to class, or not. More to come."
</p>
<p>
So, what makes this more than a patch note? Well, Battlefield has always sort of been celebrated as the shooter in which classes play you.  This isn't Call Of Duty, a game in thrall to the individual killing spree, but a sim that thrives on large-scale teamwork and apocalyptic attrition.</p>
<p>That said, the teamwork focus has arguably hindered Battlefield's efforts to expand beyond the PC jarheads who fuelled its initial success, and earn the affections of casual players who just want to peacock and drop an airstrike or two. It makes the game less approachable and immediately gratifying, more reliant on people having trustworthy mates. Hence DICE's efforts to soften the focus with features such as the Specialist system.</p>
<p>In marketing terms, Battlefield's class-driven format also makes for a game that can feel rather faceless next to, say, the ultra-giffable hero shooters of the 2010s, in which every player is a star. I'm not sure any individual aspect of Battlefield has ever "gone viral" like an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> character, save for those trickshots of pilots <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re2aLmK8koA">hipfiring a bazooka in mid-air</a>, and the barmier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh9e3PDAOc">physics glitches</a>. It doesn't help that there has never been an unambiguously terrific Battlefield singleplayer mode.
</p>
<p>
As such, the decision of whether to insist that certain Battlefield 6 classes use certain guns is fraught. I imagine DICE will be very nervy about introducing anything that constrains a greenhorn player's choices in a game that - if rumour breath true - has cost over $400 million, and wants to amass a playerbase equivalent to the population of Vietnam. I guess giving people a choice of playlists is the best way forward. We'll hopefully be able to bring you some hands-on impressions soon.

        <p>Naturally, the trailer features some foreplay gone awry</p>

            <p>Picture the scene. You and someone you like are gettin' it on. Maybe with Barry White crooning away in the background, scented candles, sweaty palms. Then, one of you touches a box and boom, a bloke who's clearly come out on the wrong end of a trip to an arts &amp; crafts shop walks in with some hooks and says stuff about pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>Such is (pretty much) the way of classic 80s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> film Hellraiser, and therefore such is the plot of the trailer for the very first full game based on it. Said game's a slice of singleplayer survival horror dubbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival</a>, from Evil: Within devs Boss Team Games and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> publishers Saber Interactive.</p>

<p>"Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth," reads the suitable hellish blurb. "Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites."</p>
<p>In a fun twist, original actor Doug Bradley's reprised the role of Cenobite leader Pinhead in the game, and it'll be his first appearance behind the pin-laden visage in two decades.</p>

<p>Clive Barker himself's been looped in on crafting the story, and he's been a fan of Boss Team and Saber's dedication to the pursuit of gaming pleasure. "They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence — the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque — and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold," the writer and filmmaker said. "I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Sounds cool, but maybe make sure stray children aren't likely to walk in on you playing it, given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1551980/">the Steam page</a>'s lengthy content warning. There's no release date or even window on that Steam page yet, so you'll just have to find joy in slightly less carnal pleasures for the minute.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-publishers-reveal-hellraiser-revival-a-singleplayer-horror-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>
