            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is being delayed into 2026 by its publishers Krafton, which would lead to the survival game's studio missing out on a previously agreed $250 million bonus, meant to be shared among employees. The revelation comes via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout">a report from Bloomberg</a>, and could finally explain why Krafton ousted the studio's most senior figures last week. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Three higher-ups at the studio were summarily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out last week</a> and "replaced" with the CEO of Striking Distance, Steve Papoutsis. The studio's original co-founder, Charlie Cleveland, was one of those who felt the sharp toecap of Krafton's boot, and has since said it came as a "shock". </p>
<p>In a letter posted to social media, Cleveland wrote that the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">"ready for early access"</a>. This is in contradiction to Krafton, who have spoken about delivering "the right game at the right time" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">communicated via Unknown Worlds</a> that there would be an "update to our schedule". </p>

<p>However, during an all-hands meeting, workers at Unknown Worlds questioned new CEO Papoutsis about the reasons for a planned delay. And those clever sneaks at Bloomberg heard a recording of his response.</p>
<p>When asked about the coup and the intended delay, Papoutsis reportedly said: "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn’t where both parties aligned around." (Let us award the producer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> some corpopoints for using "aligned around" instead of human language like "agreed".)  </p>
<p>When asked whether a delay was being enacted to avoid paying out the bonus, Papoutsis replied: "It’s never been told to me that we’re making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that."</p>
<p>We've contacted Krafton for comment. They have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus">confirmed the delay to IGN</a>. A <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">statement</a> on Unknown Worlds' website says the delay is meant "to give ourselves a little extra time." </p>
<p>"[The] events of this week have been quite a shock," said Cleveland in that letter to fans. "We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>It's good at least to have a little clarity about the reasons why such a dramatic power shuffle has occured. The former Unknown Worlds leadership and Krafton disagreed about the game's readiness, and both parties had an incentive to be right. In this case, Krafton used a blugeon to settle the issue.</p>
<p>In April, Krafton <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-achieves-record-high-quarterly-sales-in-q1-2025/">reported record profits</a> in the first quarter of 2025, hitting $608 million in sales and $308 million in operating profit. Its CEO, Kim Chang-han, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11267646">received a bonus</a> last year of $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is the second most wishlisted game on Steam, only beaten by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus]]></content:encoded>

        <p>SAG-AFTRA have been fighting for the contract for three years</p>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">"tentative agreement" reached last month</a> between video game voice actors represented by union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> and companies including Activision, Insomniac, and EA, the 11-month strike is now over. A new contract has been approved, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">"effective immediately"</a>. with 95% of participating union members voting in favour, with 5% opposed.</p>
<p>The terms of the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/2025%20Interactive%20Media%20%28Video%20Game%29%20Agreement%20Summary.pdf">Interactive Media Agreement</a> include increased performer compensation, including overtime rates, and "guardrails" against AI - "including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for the generation of new material during a strike".</p>

<p>“We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers," said spokesperson Audrey Cooling, "on behalf of the video game producers that are party to the agreement".</p>
<p>Those enhanced health and safety measures, as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike">Game Developer</a> note, mean trained medical staff will need to be present at rehearsals and performances that plan "hazardous actions or working conditions". Employers also won't be able to request actors do dangerous stunts in auditions, and performers will have mandated rests.</p>
<p>In terms of AI protections, the new contract will ensure performers receive specified minimum payments for use of digital replicas made from their performances, higher compensation from the use of chatbots based on their performances, and payments when their performances are used in future projects.</p>
<p>Last January, SAG-AFTRA struck a deal with the <a href="https://www.replicastudios.com/">now-closed Replica Studios</a> to allow voice actors to license 'digital replicas' of their likenesses and voices. "We have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances,” said the union's director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland at the time, with union's announcement calling the move "approved by affected members of the union’s voiceover performer community”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">This drew criticism from several prominent actors</a>, including Deux Ex: Human Revolution's Elias Toufexis. "I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors working in games," the actor said back then, "No one asked me about this. No one reached out for my opinion. From what I'm seeing, no one asked any of my peers either."</p>
<p>The Interactive Media Agreement classifies these "Digital Replicas" as either "Vocal" or "Visual", defined as being capable of "algorithmically generating new performances" in the voice or likeness of a specific performer. The now-ratified contract requires clear consent from performers, including knowledge of a “reasonably specific description of intended use”, specifying things like genre, profanity, violent or sexual content, stunts, and whether the performer will be reprising a specific role.</p>
<p>There's also this bit, which I'm sure is necessary, but also makes for some fascinatingly grim reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>4) Deceased Performers:</p>
<p>(a) Consent that Performers grant during their lifetimes shall continue to be valid after death unless explicitly limited otherwise at the time of the initial consent.</p>
<p>(b) If Performer is deceased at the time Employer seeks consent, Employer shall obtain the consent of the authorized representative (e.g., their estate).</p>
<p>(c) If the deceased Performer’s authorized representative cannot be identified or located, consent may be obtained from the Union.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the contract is largely being celebrated as a victory for union members, SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-vas-are-starting-to-call-for-the-end-of-the-sag-aftra-strike.1195908/">received criticism from actors</a> for allegedly prolonging the negotiations process after the sought-for AI protections were in place, making it difficult for performers to get work.</p>
<p>My favourite characterisation I've read of these fairly dry stipulations was Chris Kerr's over at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike">Game Developer</a>, who points out that performers now effectively have the ability to send their digital replicas on strike. If <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">James Earl Jones called me a scab I'd probably cry</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-over-with-new-ai-agreements-reached-over-digital-replicas]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I did scan strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-scum">Space Scum</a>'s trailer a few times for the hint of a feature that didn't make me immediately think, ah yeah, that's just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a> innit. This is a bit unfair of me. After all, your dudes sit on chess piece-like plinths in this one. That's innovation, right? Anyway, I like the art and the bloke from the trailer looks like he'd nut me if I dwelled on the comparison too long. With someone else's face. So, here's a trailer. There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601980/Space_Scum/">Steam demo</a> from next month, although you can sign up for a playtest now.</p>

<p>The gang's all here. Turn-based battles. Procedural planets. Origins and character traits. Mercenary permadeath. Gear looting. Skill trees. The sci-fi setting does offer a few twists, though. I'm a fan of the enemy variety I've seen so far, for one. Space rats. Space lizards. Space bugs. All the stuff you don't want to find in your sacks of space grain, basically. Range combat also naturally plays a bigger part here, and you can specialise your mercs in things like hacking and turret use.</p>
<p>Also, look how furious and/or very hungry these rats are. Very emotive. A cornucopia of different ways to be aggravated, possess these rats.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Space Scum is a tactical, turn-based RPG, set across multiple procedurally generated planets, ensuring no playthrough is the same - though they all exist in the same gritty, Sci-Fi universe. You’ll choose your own custom origin and encounter different environments, enemy types, factions and missions, all based on where you go and what you choose to do. Of course, when all the choices are yours, so are the consequences…"</p></blockquote>
<p>Had I a say in such matters, I would probably look at the available footage for my game, cross-reference it against the word 'gritty' in my marketing blurb, come to the conclusion that the audience could probably work that bit out for themselves, and then choose literally any other word, preferably one more specific to the universe I've created here, lest someone assume my worldbuilding process consisted of choosing the word 'gritty' then working backwards from there. I'll play the demo though, sure. Looks fun. Full release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-scum-is-a-sci-fi-strategy-rpg-take-on-battle-brothers]]></content:encoded>
