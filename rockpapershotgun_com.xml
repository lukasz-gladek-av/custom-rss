            <p>If you dream of playing a game set inside a diagram of a spacebase from a Usborne Cutaway book published in the 1990s, Kuu is probably for you. If you dream of being very sad on the Moon, tending sickly plants for 30 days by Earthlight, then Kuu is also, probably, for you. If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> but wish it was as depressing as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, Kuu is also also, probably, for you.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's a bright and bony colony management game in which you play the titular Kuu, a "silent caretaker" for a "fragile sisterhood", trapped in a lunar greenhouse that has been trashed by a "mysterious blast" from a "long-abandoned Earth". You will divide each day between such tasks as setting up the solar panels (at the cost of blocking the light to your growpods), scouring the radio spectrum for help, and combing downloaded documents for answers about your plight. Here be trailer.</p>

<p>Being a silent caretaker, you will only be able to nod or shake your head when your sisters come to you with questions or requests. "Some will starve, and some will snap," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3442050/KUU/">the Steam page comments</a>. "It will be your fault." Good-O. Each night, you'll retire to a hibernation pod and pick through a monograph left behind by a "disgraced pseudo-archaeologist". If it were me, I'd be binging Toradora excerpts and tearfully devouring a very large bowl of cereal, but I imagine Kuu doesn't have access to Youtube.</p>
<p>Kuu is the work of the perhaps humourously named Interactive Tragedy, Limited, founded by <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/zach.dodson">New Zealand academic Zach Dodson</a>. It's the video game component of a hybrid book project which seeks to "combine traditional print design and creative writing with new approaches in interactive fiction and visual narrative".</p>
<p>While I find some of the Steam page language a little too pointed in its poignancy, I like the cut(away) of Kuu's gib. I also like the sound of Dodson's research in general, as briefly outlined in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3442050/view/528724050310070595?l=english">this Steam post</a> on how "the affordances of different media can create a narrative ecosystem", which reminds me a bit of Whitney Trettien's <a href="https://whitneyannetrettien.com/thesis/">work on volvelles</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've been enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>, but reckon its towering mountains aren't filling you with enough existential dread, there's a mod you need to check out. It's called Everest, and it fills your game with other players' dead bodies.</p>
<p>Well, skeletons to be exact, and possibly over 10,000 of them by the sounds of it. That's more bones that you'll find at Crufts, and it looks to turn the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">co-op climbing game</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> devs Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> devs Landfall into the sort of morbid fun you can usually only have by chucking a frisbee around the garden of a crematorium. No, I haven't done that last bit. Yet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Steven, who's part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> community modding group, has put down their neon sword and made <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Steven/Everest/">Everest</a>. It's a mod which "saves your death location and populates your world with skeletons where others have fallen." Lovely.</p>
<p>By scattering this spooky, scary stuff throughout your surroundings, the modder aims to create "a shared experience, potentially marking dangerous areas and connecting you to other adventurers in death." Given how often folks die in Peak, it appears you'll be connecting with a lot of corpses in addition to your own, with Steven having tweeted that one of the mod's first days in operation saw "10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players" be summoned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I made a silly mod for <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AggroCrabGames</a>'s PEAK that fills your game with the skeletons of those who came (and died) before you. Yesterday's island saw 10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players!</p><p>Download link in the replies. <a href="https://t.co/TeDFNXbjMD">pic.twitter.com/TeDFNXbjMD</a></p></div>â€” Steven ðŸŽ€ (@BSMG_Steven) <a href="https://twitter.com/BSMG_Steven/status/1942302342583574814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It's a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, though I assume instead of 'try finger but hole', the messages these corpses will wordlessly convey are more along the lines of 'try ledge but fall'.</p>
<p>The mod comes with a "detailed" config file so you can adjust things to suit your preferences and handy notifications that'll let you know if it's working or not, just in case your island not being littered with corpses isn't a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab modding framework <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">BepInEx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask">UniTask</a>, the latter being "a library used to better handle async operations in Unity".</p>
<p>I'm not saying you have to blast Drowning Pool's Bodies on repeat while you've got Everest installed, but surely it can't hurt the experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed">Need For Speed</a> game in the last decade, odds are you've seen plenty of cars with Speedhunters stickers slapped somewhere amid whatever delightfully tacky livery their driver's decided to rock. Now, though, it looks like the EA-owned car culture site has gone dormant, with reports claiming it might have been shut down.</p>
<p>This news comes as development of NFS at EA is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">on a hiatus</a>, with devs at Criterion having been drafted in to help deliver the next Battlefield, though exec Vince Zampella has hinted that there are still plans for the racing series going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-looks-like-speedhunters-is-dead">The Drive</a>, Speedhunters' site hasn't had any new stories published to it since April 3. Links to its store return an error message, and its Instagram account boasts an ominous black void as a profile photo.</p>
<p>The Drive reports having heard that Speedhunters might been shut down. We've reached out to EA for comment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by <a href="https://rodchong.com/about/">Rod Chong</a>, Speedhunters have been <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/02/the-need-for-speedhunting/">backed by EA</a> since "since day one", with the various car-related articles and photography they've delivered over the years having been interspersed with plenty of NFS coverage and promo. As recently as December last year, the site were writing about <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/12/my-day-with-the-need-for-speed-bmw-m3-gtr/">the special Most Wanted BMW M3</a> that released in commemoration of the NFS series' 30th anniversary, having also covered <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/08/everything-need-know-nfs-unbound-vol-8-cops-vs-racers/">updates</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed-unbound">NFS Unbound</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, Speedhunters has also been a regular presence in NFS games themselves via those ubiquitous stickers. One of its journalists, Dino Dalle Carbonare, even made a cameo in utterly forgettable mobile game NFS: No Limits.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shootingcars/comments/1lne5xv/comment/n0kzeg8/">Reddit comment</a> responding to chatter about Speedhunters' unclear situation, former contributor <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/author/2279972671/">Paddy McGrath</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven't been involved in any meaningful way with the site over the last few years (although my name is still listed as a contributor). I did have the intention of submitting stories when I could in the future, but that doesn't look like it's going to be possible anymore.</p>
<p>FWIW, there were so many times that Speedhunters was circling the drain over the last decade. We rarely knew ahead of time if our contracts would be renewed each year. A lot of brilliant and dedicated people put a lot of work in to keep things going as long as it did.</p>
<p>As you might know, Speedhunters was founded and supported by EA from day one. It wouldn't have existed without them. However, Speedhunters was such a small project in an otherwise massive company that it was never going to get the attention &amp; resources it needed to grow, IMO. Why would they spend time on a website selling some merchandise when they have multiple billion dollar video game brands to tend to? </p>
<p>As time passed, and the original EA people involved in the creation of Speedhunters moved onto other things, it became more and more difficult to keep the project afloat. I knew this day was inevitable, so made the decision years ago to diversify my client base and take all of my eggs out of the Speedhunters basket. I am genuinely sad that this does look like the end for it, it deserved so much better.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here's hoping Speedhunters hasn't done its last set of doughnuts in front of some expensive cameras.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-need-for-speed-devs-working-on-battlefield-eas-beloved-car-culture-site-seems-to-have-shut-off-its-engine]]></content:encoded>
