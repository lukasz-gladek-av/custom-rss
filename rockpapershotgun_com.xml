            <p>The genre of 'Action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a> and similar games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile">Path Of Exile</a>, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.</p>
<p>It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Feels like the genre of "ARPG" is starting to mean a lot of different things," Fergusson <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1859753130172482003">wrote on X</a> - thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-boss-gets-ratiod-for-saying-we-should-normalize-diablo-like-for-arpgs-that-follow-the-diablo-formula-much-like-souls-like-and-rogue-like/">GamesRadar</a>. "Much like "Souls-like" and "Rogue-like", I wonder if we could normalize "Diablo-like" for ARPGs that follow the Diablo formula..."</p>
<p>This caused a bit of uproar in the comments, but it’s Da Musk Zone - everything from saying you like waffles to recognising the existence of trans people causes an uproar these days. One point of contention I’m a bit sympathetic to, though, is that Fergusson's suggestion does place the Diablo series in a sort of progenitor role that also assumes a level of quality. One which many don’t seem to think it deserves any more, even if the original games undoubtedly pioneered what we might call a genre.</p><p>Anyway, as usual, the one who has to step in to clear up is this mess is old muggins over here, and I say this: If it’s an RPG that features action like the action you’d find in an action game, it’s an 'Action RPG' (ARPG for short). But! If it’s an action game that features RPG elements like those you’d find in an RPG, that there is an 'ARPG', also known as an 'Action RPG'. Note, however, that neither of these describe Diablo, which has demons in it - and is therefore a Doom Clone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip.1047285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, and the world will feel my pain. </p>
<p>Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of <a href="https://www.frazettamuseum.com/collections/framed-art">Frank Frazetta</a>'s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">his excellent Space Marine piece</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, a valued RPS community member <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">on the Discord</a> shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. </p>

<p>Here's the piece in question. Shout out to CMaster on the Discord. </p>

<p>Thing is, I've most definetely seen this piece before, because the original <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/StarCraft.PDF">Starcraft manual</a> that houses it was primo toilet reading back in the day. But it was still a shock seeing it again, especially considering how different it is to the style I associate Blizzard with currently. Here's a few more for the Zerg and Protos.</p>

The mutalisk, especially, isn't worlds away from some of Starcraft II's art. But things get really interesting when you look at a few bits from <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/Warcraft%202%20Battlenet%20edition.PDF">Warcraft II's manual</a>.

In contrast, here's a more recent orc from <a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/World-of-Warcraft/Focus/Warlords-of-Draenor-concept-art">Blizzard's archives</a>. As far as I can tell, it's a concept piece from the 2014 expansion Warlords Of Draenor.

<p>If you prefer this more recent piece, I absolutely get it. While I'm not a fan of the softness and stylisation myself, it's very distinctly a Warcraft orc. This could just be an effect of familiarity, sure, but you could identify that as Blizzard immediately, while the older piece could be from any number of DIY, grungy OSR manuals. Personally, though, that's why I love it.</p>
<p>Here's a human. Sorry about the text. Bloody love their text, humans do.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's it, that's the post! As I said, figured a few of you might get a kick out of seeing the old art, especially if it's your first time. Also, I'm contractually obligated to write 'orc' at least twelve times a week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
