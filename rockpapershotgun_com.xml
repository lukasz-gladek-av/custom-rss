            <p>Well, who could have seen this coming: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has taken Steam offline, or at least, laid waste to large swathes of it. Within seconds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">its release this afternoon</a>, Team Cherry’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel brought Valve's servers to a halt, cue endlessly loading pages when trying to access the checkout, browse the store or do much of anything.
</p><!--more-->
<p>I can’t even sign in. I’m currently staring into the void of an infinite “loading user data” loop. I can’t get the “Most Played” chart to load in a web browser, either, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 101,828 people playing already. Smash cut to live footage of Gabe Newell ejected screaming from his exploding yacht, hotly pursued by a cloud of burning hornets. 
</p>
<p>If you’re hoping to play on Steam in the next hour or so, you may encounter the following dread message: "Error Code: 2811-7429. Couldn't connect to the server. The network may be busy, or there may be a problem with the server. Please try again later." There are already thousands of reports of a Steam outage on <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/steam/">Downdetector</a>. Valve have yet to comment. The game is also available on GOG, who have a much smaller audience, but I hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://bsky.app/profile/khonziel.bsky.social/post/3lxzdkzrccs26%E2%80%9D">they’re having similar difficulties</a>. 
</p>
<p>May the good gods save our engineers in this time of Silksinging. May the good gods save them, at least, from wrathful emails. Having to wait an hour or two for demand to die back so you can play Silksong is no great burden. Still, as ever with Steam overloads, you do have to wonder whether Valve as a whole could have prepared better for this. 
</p><p>Silksong has been Steam’s most-wishlisted game since forever. I’m not clear on what Valve do when they know something is going to be mega-popular - I assume it involves buying more servers, but perhaps they just pour energy drinks over the existing ones while uttering the Optimiser’s Prayer. Perhaps they just stick a bike pump in the outer wall of the server farm and have an intern crank the handle for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>If you’re trying to play, best of luck. James claims he’s already got it downloading, but then he’s always trying to be the popular one.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has officially buzzed across the thin red line between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">"entirely hypothetical object of mass hysteria"</a> and "existing videogame that you can play on your PC". Team Cherry's new metroidvania is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">live now on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/hollow_knight_silksong">GOG</a>. You can actually buy it with your actual money. <em>Should</em> you buy it? Sadly, I don't yet have a Hollow Knight: Silksong review for you, because Team Cherry have decided not to distribute any codes in advance. If you're reading a Silksong review right now, the reviewer is either a worryingly close confidant of the developers or a filthy bloody liar or some other, totally innocent third thing.</p>
<p>The absence of early review code reflects the fact that Silksong already has more Hype than most messiahs, partly thanks to Team Cherry's long silence about gameplay specifics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">Silksong's release date</a>, after an initial flurry of publicity in 2019. Only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> has attracted this many conspiracy theorists. Team Cherry need attention from reviewers at this point like a drowning person needs a glass of water.</p>
<p>A lot of the Hype has arrived care of the Silksong subreddit, who are in both a celebratory and a mourning mood today. "God help me I don't know where to start," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n7oyhv/thank_you_rsilksong_legacy_flairs_from_your/">writes</a> one of the founding moderators, zoravy. "Thank you everyone for the insanity and fun I never could've predicted when starting this place up in 2021, this has genuinely been one of the funnest places to be on all of the internet, and its been an honour to see every bit of it, from the start."</p>
<p>It's certainly been a journey. Wired have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-fans-turned-waiting-for-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-into-a-game/">published a good piece</a> about the meta-gaming of Silksong anticipation, with subreddit subscribers not just fomenting speculation about release details but actively making things up and trolling each other. Major events include the "sacrificing" of certain users to Silksong - that is, they were banned from the subreddit, and only permitted to return after launch. There was also a running joke about fake copies being distributed by "Snosk", a fully manifested version of one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>'s hidden bosses. To this, add <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">my own reporting about that cake</a>. </p>
<p>Hollow Knight, of course, is a game of copious, wriggling lore, so all of this roleplaying is entirely appropriate. If only I could persuade the dang <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> remake rumour-mongers to think this way.</p>
<p>We may not have a review as yet, but we do have James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">hands-on verdict from Gamescom</a>. "It's a little quicker, a little more dynamic, and to these fingers, a little more difficult than the first Hollow Knight," he wrote. "But it entirely preserves that tight-as-a-drum feel of the original's sword swishing, and deploys it against insectoid baddies that challenge and frustrate in practically identical ways."</p>
<p>We also, rather terrifyingly, have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">the prospect of Silksong DLC</a>. For context, Silksong itself began life as a humble Hollow Knight DLC pack, before it transcended those mortal confines and levelled up into a piece of internet phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>Are you buying today? Good luck to you. Let us know how you get on.</p>
