        <p>Yes, every Peak headline I write will contain the same pun</p>

            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s patch 1.02, which'll deliver the Duo Expeditions players have been asking for, has had its deployment pushed back by a day due a tsunami warning.</p>
<p>The update was orginally set to go out today, July 30th, but will now go out tomorrow, July 31st. The tsunami warning that's led developers FromSoftware to have to switch up their plans is one of many consequences of a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>FromSoft announced the change via a Twitter post, penning the patch in to go out at after 9AM BST / 4AM ET / 1AM PDT/ 10AM CEST on the 31st. The beginning of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-enhanced-boss-wave-crashes-against-the-shores-of-frustration-at-the-end-of-this-month">second cycle of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, the enhanced bosses that the devs have been releasing into the game on a weekly rotation, has also been pushed back until after the patch has gone live.</p>
<p>Aside from that Duos mode, which FromSoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">committed to delivering</a> not long after the multiplayer Soulsperience debuted, patch 1.02 is set to include the likes of UI tweaks and more relic filtering options.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT.</p>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Japan's one of a number of countries which have been forced to issue tsunami warnings and evacuation orders following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t">8.8 magnitude earthquake hitting eastern Russia</a> in the early hours of this morning UK time. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t?post=asset%3A5003b4cf-79bb-4456-beb8-8df0e593fd55#post">Reportedly one of the strongest earthquakes ever on record</a>, its aftermath has seen coastal areas in Russia, the western US states, Hawaii, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, Colombia and Japan prepare for potentally dangerous waves, as the shock ripples out across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>More than 1.9 million people have been asked to evacuate in Japan, the BBC report, with the country's meteorological agency estimating that tsunami waves could reach up to three metres high.</p>
<p>Here's hoping everyone in the affected places can stay safe.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There are some mods that you need to read up on before you understand why you might want to give them a whirl. There are some mods with which that process can be accomplished via a single GIF. A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> work that makes it possible to hilariously reduce the contents of Cyrodiil's cities to chunks of flying rubble just by slapping buildings with spells is firmly in the latter camp.</p>
<p>Before you get too worried about the karmic balance of the modding wizard powerful enough to make this sort of wanton destruction possible, it's worth bearing in mind that they've previously given players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">the ability to build new homes</a> any displaced citizens could probably move into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Oblivimaster tweaker MadAborModding, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">we interviewed about his work earlier this month</a>, has clearly been busy since that point. His latest mod, as its name on Nexus Mods yells in all caps, lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4943?tab=description">DESTROY BUILDINGS</a>. I usually like text to keep the hollering to a minimum, but honestly I think he's earned it here.</p>
<p>As the GIFs on the mod page and the below showcase video from Reddit show off, the modder's developed a means of getting Oblivion Remastered's buildings to hilariously explode into bits when you fire spells at them. It's glorious. Well, unless you're an NPC living in some stone tower that's just been uprooted and sent spinning into the sky.</p>
<p>"This is only possible because of Unreal, the creation engine in any other Bethesda game wouldn't let you do this," the building batterer wrote in the thread below the video, "But in unreal, all you gotta do is flip a few true/false flags."</p> 
<p>Don't worry, though, the effects of any impromptu demolition you get up to aren't permanent, with everything resetting to normal when you next hit a loading screen. On one hand, that's maybe disappointing if you're eyeing up a playthrough in which, to paraphrase Walter White, you are the Oblivion Crisis. Though, given how much lobbing staircases into the stratosphere would inconvenience the story, I reckon MadAborModding's right to pitch this as temporary fun.</p>
<p>That said, he sounds like he's far from done working on it. Future plans include giving buildings their own health stats and a visible health bar, as well as letting you hack chunks out of them with non-magical attacks. That'd bring the mod closer to a full-blown house fighting experience, something I didn't know I wanted in Oblivion, but now definitely do.</p>
<p>The option to limit the destruction to specific areas of the game is also in the works. As of right now, the mod comes with its own optional tweaking menu thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">Mad Mod Config Menu</a>, in case you fancy messing with the explosion radius or enabling anti-gravity.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. I wish your hardware the best in coping with the amount of fireplaces that're about to be whizzing around the Imperial province.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting]]></content:encoded>
