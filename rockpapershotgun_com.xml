            <p>The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">an easygoing escape</a>. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sledding-game">Sledding Game</a> looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine. </p>

<p>You'll earn points while sledding down the mountain (at one point we see the sledder grind a rail) and then use these points to buy cosmetics like "hats, jackets, scarves, goggles" as well as stickers for your sled. You'll be able to make snowmen, get into snowball fights, and ride a ski lift back up the mountain when you inevitably wipe out on an unexpected slope. "Whether you're racing to the bottom or taking it slow, the hill is all about fun, friends, and freedom," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3438850/Sledding_Game/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game's creator, a solo developer professionally branded as "The Sledding Company", has been posting devlog videos on TikTok since December. They demonstrate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7459466030050479402">how players will get off the ski lift</a> and pay sorrowful tribute to an <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7458729542614584619">endless field of frog corpses</a>. "My main inspiration is mainly from Webfishing, which I guess is inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>," said the dev in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7450006703212350766">the video announcing the game</a>, before asking for suggestions from viewers. "I don't really know where to go with this project, I just think it's a fun little game-slash-playground-thing." </p><p>The creator also has plans to add 100-player lobbies with proximity voice chat and text chat, which seems a tad ambitious for a small-scale messabout like this. Not to mention a surefire way to emperil the "cozy" and low-key vibe the game seems to be aiming at. Webfishing has 12-player lobbies, for example, and already has to contend with the spectrum of online (mis)behaviour that comes with chat rooms. Even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, a more chaotic party game about going downhill in the snow, taps out at 40 players (and it limits player chitchat to emotes). Although the Sledding Company does add that the 100-player plan is not set in stone, saying: "until further testing, this will just be a guess".</p>
<p>However it turns out, I like when devs show their work like this. I know it can simply be a good marketing strategy for smaller studios and lone developers (people like to watch funny videos on apps that annoy the United States government, it turns out) but ragdolls are always appreciated. And watching developers run headfirst into bugs is doubtless reassuring for fellow struggling game designers otherwise doomscrolling into the abyss. </p>
<p>Sledding Game doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll keep an eye on these penguins for you. It looks like they require supervision anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Steam are throwing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_real_time">Real-Time Strategy Fest</a> this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">Creeper World 4</a> were a bit more like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ground-control-game">Ground Control</a>.

<p>The premise: you are the sole surviving crew member aboard an Avaris Corporation deep-space mining vessel. After a century in cryosleep, you're woken by the shipboard AI and unceremoniously bundled off to the surface of a lifeless planet in search of ore. Then you discover that the planet ain't so lifeless.</p>
<p>The basic flow here is a mixture of tower-defencey base-building and surgical incursions upon a decentralised, enveloping threat that steadily and insidiously paints the map its colour. You'll need to set up turrets and a robust power grid to keep them online. But you'll also need to build tanks, artillery and so forth so that you can clear distant canyons of invasive plants before they become a problem. There are different kinds of plants, which correspond in some ways to the unit types of a traditional RTS, but the thrill of Calyx, I think, is pitting a regular strategy game toolset against a foe that doesn't play by the same rules.</p><p>The demo includes a tutorial level and "an alpha quality, mid-game level to show how the final experience might feel". Creators Studio 568 <a href="https://www.studio568.co.uk/about">were founded</a> by three, pretty seasoned developers with credits at Epic Games, Lionhead and Natural Motion. All three previously worked at The Irregular Corporation, creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/going-medieval-is-a-buildier-friendlier-rimworld-spinoff">Going Medieval</a>. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211850/Calyx/">read more on Steam</a>. I hope this turns out to be good.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I guess chopping off horns and tails in the preceding fight counts as "butchery", but this process is quite stagey too, somewhat scripted, a little bit... canned. Ugh, I am getting lost in the permutations. I no longer know how to make this metaphor work. Like a hunter fleeing a Rathalos that was actually only <em>playing</em> dead, I must make a terrified leap to the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via Capcom's <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">German Xitter account</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements">Eurogamer</a>, who note that Monster Hunter Wilds' existing PC system specs have "raised a few eyebrows" - especially given the last beta's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buggy-monsters-in-monster-hunter-wilds-have-sparked-a-wave-of-low-poly-animal-adoration">slight tendency to make the monsters look like angry Dali paintings</a>. Capcom say they're focussing on the game's recommended GPU requirements, while also trying to improve performance. Here's a screenshot of the current PC specs from Steam, for context.

Seeking guidance from the gods, I ran those specs by our hardware editor James. Our remote-working format made it impossible to ascertain whether his eyebrows were raised, but he didn't seem to think the requirements were excessive. He did suggest that 140GB was quite a lot of SSD space, and that the recommended specs only allowing for 60 FPS with frame generation is a bit weird. And that the minimum GPU requirement is on the beefy side. Me, I'm still goggling at 16GB of RAM. I hear this is pretty standard nowadays, for a game with all three "A"s, but in my head, 8GB is still the norm for minimum spec.
</p><p>
I'm interested to know what you all think should be the minimum and recommended specs for a game of Monster Hunter Wilds stature right now. Both in terms of your own setups, and more abstractly in terms of what you consider a fair price for all those frames and pixels. Come, let us explore this vexing question as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">parable</a> about the blind men feeling their way around the elephant, trying to ascertain its complete form. Wait a minute, this elephant has wings. It's that bloody Rathalos again.

            <p>One piece of worldbuilding advice I've always found useful is to go at least one level deeper than the obvious. To wit: why have a lantern, asks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mohrta">Mohrta</a>, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Steam demo</a>. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.</p>

<p>It's a world of stumpy, cowbell-wearing pet giraffes and ferocious avian nightmare bastards. These aren't things I'm used to dealing with on daily basis, so I naturally sought something to ground myself. Luckily, you start with a very nice, comfortingly chunky pistol with an excellent alt fire that unloads a full clip at whatever you're pointing at. Your sword also has an alt fire, as all good swords should. These use mana, which you can restore with a big sippy from your flask. And so you progress. Looking at things and going "oh yeah, that's cool", shooting very fast things that want you dead, and taking big sippies.</p>
<p>Between the vaguely futuristic modern and medieval bits, and the very strange horse your character rides, my mind naturally went straight to Wolfe's Book Of The New Sun. This is likely more recency bias than anything else, but there's definitely a sense of thick, somewhat pulpy history to the world, and I'm very curious to find out more about it. What's interesting is how the lore blurb would fit equally well for a modern military shooter, albeit one with a few supernatural elements:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A special military group known as "The Hayward" was formed to investigate and destroy the anomalies within The Strange. For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll often hear people say "graphics don't matter", but rarely the same about features. I must then conclude that most people care about features. As such, here are Mohrta's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adventure through an atypical take on the FPS genre.</li>
<li>Play through the game's five enormous and differently-themed dimensions in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Soak in the otherworldly atmosphere and lovingly-crafted level design.</li>
<li>Fight though a myriad of highly-detailed environments that push the limits of GZDoom.</li>
<li>Explore unusual settings, characters, and enemies fleshed out in beautiful signature Scumhead detail, featuring designs by Osiol.</li>
<li>Acquire a huge roster of weapons, each with multiple functions and utility.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapons and gear, and choose a custom loadout that best suits your playstyle.</li>
<li>Over 50 diverse enemies and 20 challenging boss fights to dodge, shoot, and strike through.</li>
<li>Befriend a huge cast of strange and loveable NPCs, each with their own quests and storylines.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This one's out sometime this year. It's from Oisol and Scumhead, who did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-like-short-steampunk-snes-style-rpgs-give-dystopian-freebie-franzen-a-shot">Franzen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
