            <p>It's Tuesday, so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has gotten a fresh patch. This one makes the Illuminate's flying death slugs easier to battle and looks like it might have laid the groundwork for the game's long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Those Leviathan balancing tweaks have come after players continued to struggle to beat the airborne enemy, despite Arrowhead having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">previously added a spotlight effect</a> to the attack it can use to one-shot your bottom into oblivion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, in response to that feedback, as outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516339151333753417?l=english">patch 01.003.104</a>, Helldivers 2's devs have made four tweaks aimed at making Leviathan fights "more manageable".</p>
<p>The flying squids "no longer cause ragdolling and deal less impulse damage to vehicles". You'll also run into fewer of them per mission thanks to spawn rate tweaks, and there's an extra second delay between their shots to give you more opportunity to dodge. What's more, you can destroy their cannons.</p>
<p>The early response from players has been something along the lines of '<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ban/another_victory_for_the_right_side_of_history/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ruw/finally_we_can_destroy_leviathan_cannons/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6w41/it_was_a_needed_change_thank_you_ah/">thank youuuuuuu</a>'.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, it's just handy bug fixes, including ones for "weapons being unable to fire after stimming while using a mounted weapon" and the Warrant pistol's bullets penetrating on ricochet in a fashion they're not supposed to.</p>
<p>Right, be warned, I'm now moving into leaky/dataminey territory, so take what you read from here with a pinch of salt. Not long after today's patch dropped, Helldivers 2 leaker IronS1ghts, who's got a good track record when it comes to <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1932367095699841042">spotting stuff</a> in the game's files that then ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">being deployed</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1937447724095246618">shared an image</a> of a cape dubbed "Pillars of Freedom".</p>
<p>To my eye, and the eyes of several folks in the replies, it looks to be the review bomb cape Arrowhead have been teasing adding to the game as an inside joke since that whole PSN account linking controversy last year, and studio CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">recently chatted about releasing</a>. Here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> of the cape Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt posted a while ago if you want to play spot the difference for yourself.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes]]></content:encoded>
