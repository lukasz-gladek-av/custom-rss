            <p>
Righto, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> season 8 is starting next week, and today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> have <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189530/combat-deception-in-season-8-belials-return">dropped a whole bunch of details on it</a> ahead of its release on April 29th, so let's see what they are! First up, there's that Belial guy who the season is named after. He's back, but his "motive is unknown", and you'll eventually be able to face off against him in a new quest which introduces a couple of new NPCs. That's all well and good, but the big thing this season is its new main mechanic, boss powers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
These are abilities based on 24 bosses across Sanctuary, and they all come with a couple of effects, a main one and a modifier. One boss power is Avarice's Explosive Ore, the main ability allowing you to spawn a piece of ore when you acquire excess primary resource. After 2.5 seconds that ore blows up dealing a whopping 700% fire damage, so it sounds like these'll be pretty useful. Some powers can be acquired at any level, but a few of them you'll need to be Torment 1 or higher.

<p>
There's a new event on too, with Belial's "apparition monsters" showing up around Sanctuary. These apparitions pop up every few minutes so just have a walk about and I'm sure it'll be easy enough to take part. You can earn reputation from taking these guys down too, alongside any bosses you beat, which you can then exchange for "long-forgotten caches containing uncommon items" like Resplendent Spark and Hoard Keys. Lair bosses have had a big rework too, though the details for that are lengthy, so you can read that on the blogpost.
</p>
<p>
That <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> collab that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-big-collab-is-berserk-yeah-ok-that-ones-pretty-good-i-guess">announced last week</a> has a release date now too, May 6th, and as detailed in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189531/become-the-black-swordsman-with-diablo-iv-x-berserk">separate blog post</a>, it's just a cosmetics thing. Barbarian's will be able to dress up as Guts in his pretty iconic armour, whereas Rogue's will get the Hawk of Light and Struggler outfits (that first one being based on Griffith). 
</p>
<p>
Necromancers can also equip the Skull Night outfit, and there's a pet bundle which gives you that nose creature you've probably seen memes of. I've included his image below because if I had to see this, so did you. These cosmetics are only available until the end of season 8, so don't dilly dally if you're desperate to virtually cosplay.

            <p>Years after it was first leaked, and following weeks of increasingly loud rumours, Bethesda have finally shown off a trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remaster. It looks very shiny, and has a few new cogs under the hood. More importantly, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-is-available-now-save-17-on-pc-if-when-buying-your-steam-code-from-fanatical">out now</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, here's the trailer.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJ3PZuAjK4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>It's £50 / $50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">on Steam</a>, or fans can grab a discount by picking up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGAJx">Steam key from Fanatical for £41.79</a> / $41.79, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAb2vb">Green Man Gaming</a> for £41.99 / $41.99. </p>
<p>A showcase of the game that aired alongside the trailer saw various developers talking over some of the biggest changes. This includes the ability to sprint, and a new levelling system described as a blend between Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, which presumably replaces the divisive level scaling of the original.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a new lip-syncing system that lets the funny puppets talk better, and some re-recorded dialogue lines to better fit all the fantasy races like Khajiit and Argonians. There's also a modernied third-person perspective (no more roller-skating up the mountainside). And all the assets have been remade, clearly, with real-time lighting, a heap of fresh VFX, a redesigned user interface, and new sound effects. </p>
<p>Other stuff remains mostly untouched. The lockpicking minigames and speechcraft persuasion has been left alone, we're told, apart from a visual redesign.</p>
<p>The open world fantasy RPG has been rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos, a support studio that handles a lot of different production jobs for various companies. They've been working on it alongside Bethesda's own studios. Despite all the assets being totally re-constructed using Unreal, the game is still running on some version of Bethesda's original Creation engine, we're told.</p>

<p>The remaster's existence has been a badly kept secret since 2023, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">leaked Microsoft documents</a> were spotted in during a court case, naming the game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3 and a possible remake or remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>. More recently, various leakers and rumourmongers started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">increasingly solid information</a> about the game, such as how its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">stamina and stealth will be reworked</a>. They also predicted it would be released in tandem with its announcement, you know, as a treat. </p>
<p>We'll be playing to find out just how much of a remaster it truly is. I'm interested to see how much of Oblivion's old-school charm is lost when you refurbish it and strip out what we today see as jank. Does it still crash zoom into a guard's face with alarming alacrity when you are apprehended for stealing an apple? Old games rebuilt can go either way for me. I found the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake a faithful adaptation that played with an old space in both clever and silly ways. But the recent Tomb Raider remasters made both me and Katherine sad with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-review">HD textures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-1-3-remastereds-modern-controls-are-an-absolute-travesty">wonky controls</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
