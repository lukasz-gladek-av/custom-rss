            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>

<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>
