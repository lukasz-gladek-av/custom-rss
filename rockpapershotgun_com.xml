Look, I'm sorry, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> has the best hook of any game ever. As the headline notes, this is a game where music is illegal, and you do crimes. It's a rhythm game, no less, which it couldn't really be anything else but that, right? I've been waiting for it for about four years now, since the Kickstarter launched, and unfortunately it's still not quite ready yet. However! As of today, the next best thing is here: a demo.
</p>

<p>
"A demo? Doesn't Unbeatable already have one of those?" I hear you ask. Yes, it's had a couple in fact, but this one's a proper one, the kind that actually lets you play a vertical slice of the game so you can really get a feel for it. Earlier demos were mostly about trying out the game's rhythm mechanics, whereas this one, which was paired with yet another incredibly sharp new trailer, lets you roam around a bit. There is some rhythm gaming to be done of course, just not only to songs.

<p>
There's a couple places in the demo where you can just jam out to the sound of the beat of the world, making improvised songs to the beat of a vending machine, or the sound of seagulls. You'll also make and hang-up posters to plaster across police recruitment flyers, and, oh, you do fight cops too, because they suck (and again, music is illegal, you do crimes, etc.). There's a baseball minigame for heaven's sake! I'm not sure if I need to explain much more how compelling this demo is.
</p>
<p>
But I will anyway, because the cherry on top is that there's a Y2K as hell arcade mode now too, completely focused on the rhythm game side of it all, which I'm infinitely obsessed with already. Who knew games could look this good!
</p>
<p>
It's a really comprehensive demo that, if I weren't already positioning this as my future game of the year, would absolutely convince me to pick it up at launch. No go, be away with you, commit a felony to some sick tunes, that's an order, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> to make things easier for you.
