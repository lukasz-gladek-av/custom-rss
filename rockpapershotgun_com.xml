<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 is out now in full public access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-founders-edition/9NNRSLQGVJ1M">Microsoft Store</a> and once again, I ask myself: does Sid Meier keep a hit list of journalists who just call it plain old Civilization? What about journalists who come up with cute puns like Sidilization or CiviliSidtion or SimSiddy: The Meier The Merrier and whoops, I've just been assassinated by sniper drone. Fortunately the drone is equipped with one of those generative AI chatbots and can write the rest of this news post for me.

<p>
The latest helping of Firaxis 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> launched in early access to Founder Edition buyers last week. You may have noticed that we don't have a review yet. This is because our Civilization 7 review is the best Civilization 7 review, and much as with Worldly Wonders, the best things take time. It is marinating underground like, I don't know, some kind of exotic resource you can build an absolutely banging library with. It hangs unseen in the air around us, a cloud of purest Schrödingas refusing to condense into anything so trivial and <em>gauche</em> as a concrete verdict. 
</p>
<p>
That verdict's absence may even be for the best, as far as Firaxis and publisher 2K Games concerned. RPS strategy game columnist Sin Vega has already reviewed Sid 7 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer</a> and she wasn't especially wowed. "Its design broadly works, and a certain kind of city-optimising fan may even love it," she wrote. "But its lack of character is endemic, the extent of its annoying habits and oversights shocking for a series of such pedigree." I gather that a lot of the game feels both pointless and characterless, and that "the interface is ashamed that it's a strategy game". I'm disappointed to read that the fancy new Age structure, which breaks your campaign up into more digestible, narrative-driven chunks, is simply a source of irritation.
</p>
<p>
Sin's review is one among many, and there are plenty of positive write-ups - perhaps the RPS review will be among them - but the player mood on Steam is currently Mixed. Firaxis have put together <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583?l=english">a patch</a> for launch that suspends cross-play while they implement fixes for various issues with the camera, AI and features or systems such as naval combat and how Age progression works. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">a substantial menu of planned seasonal updates</a>, including new civilizations and leaders, which has naturally attracted some accusations that certain features should be part of the game at launch.
</p>
<p>
But you, reader dear - what do you make of Cid 7 so far? I know that a few of you are Founder's Editioners who already have dozens of hours under your belts. If you have complaints, are they the kind that can be addressed with patches, or are they more fundamental issues? Me, I look forward to playing the game six months down the road once the dust has settled. This is Meierbot85, signing off.

            <p>What would do, oh what would you do?</p>
<p>Yes, what would <em>you</em> do, with an infinite shoe?</p>
<p>Would you melt it to make yourself infinite glue?</p>
<p>Or to infinite dogs 'pon which to infinitely chew?</p>
<p>Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I'm very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me <em>rhyming cancer</em>. Also, the urge to browse the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> mods, to see what players of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/popularalltime?nav=1&amp;page_size=15&amp;page=2">Nexus Mods page</a> where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game <em>in theory</em>, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.</p>

<p>The two most popular mods are currently one for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14">infinite saving</a> (see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ware-ye-this-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-crash-bug-that-cost-me-hours-of-progress">Edwin's experience for frustrating context</a>) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32">instant herb picking</a> ("We all know how good Henry is at his leg day game, but we’ve seen this animation enough times"). Right next to that are mods to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59">stay clean for longer</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/63">carry more stuff</a>. Less pesky simulation, basically, and very similar to the most popular mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance?tab=popular+%28all+time%29">for the first game</a>. A bit further down is my favourite one though, tied closely with this "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/12">totally unnecessary reticle for bows and crossbows</a>".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/125">Infinite shoe durability</a> does what it says on the shoebox - disabling the wear and tear Henry accumulates on his footwear while gallivanting around the Bohemian wilderness, and so eliminating the need to replace or repair his favourite pair. To me, this is both a little baffling (again, surely you play a game like KC:D II for this kind of frictive minutiae), but also very funny, simply because I find the idea of infinite shoes very funny.</p>
<p>So, this is a call out. The first person to mod a quest into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> II where Henry meets the fabled Infinite Cobbler gets my kingdom, my horse, and one pair of my actual, finite shoes. There wasn't a massive quest modding scene for the first game, mind. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1101">The Cuman War mod</a> allowed you to fight repeatable battles all over the map, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958">Architect mod</a> added base-building features, but otherwise the modding tools available don't seem to have been conducive to something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s many fan-made stories. Ah well, we'll always have those shoes at least.</p>
<p>"Warhorse's historical open world RPG makes Elder Scrolls feel shallow," wrote Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">in his review</a>, "but its deft feudal portrayal is checked by the routine boy's fable at its core".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
