            <p>
There are many words that could be said, and I'll attempt to say a few of them here, on the gamification of both menial labour and tasks, but it is always fascinating to me when a new game crops up that somehow makes me go "oh, sure, why not!" Today that applies to a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/leaf-blower-co">Leaf Blower Co.</a>, which is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game about exactly what you'd expect (blowing leaves) and I suppose not what you expect (blowing paper boats and coconuts).
</p>
<p>
I bring your attention to Leaf Blower Co. because it just released a release date - November 17th, later this month, very seasonally appropriate - but also because of how specific a task it is. Said task is one that is, as many of these games often are, satisfying. Hurray, no more leaves on my front lawn, and I did so by blowing them around, what fun! It is also the kind of task that many of us who face this problem will inevitably put off until it is not so putoffable.

<p>
Here though, there is an opportunity to do it recreationally, without the requirement of physical effort, and no so to speak real-world punishment (messy lawn your neighbour doesn't like and moans about at you) for not finishing or even starting it.
</p><p>
You don't have to just blow the leaves in Leaf Blower Co. You can jump in them, of course, or burn them, rake them, suck them up, magnetise them. Not entirely sure how that last one works, but the world of video game logic is infinitely confusing, so we'll put that to the side. There are secrets to discover too apparently, one of the trailers on Steam shows that you can, quite quietly, play a bunch of different horns that all toot one note by blowing into them with your blower.
</p>
<p>
There is some of that ickiness that can come with these games, in that the goal is to build up your leaf blowing business. I think games like these often end up becoming so popular because they are (almost) tangible ways to accomplish these tasks that in reality we just might not be able to because of external factors like mental and physical health, or a simple lack of time due to feeding that disgusting beast called capitalism. So, I don't entirely judge games like Leaf Blower Co., I do think it looks like a relaxing time, but I wonder how we can reframe, or even just frame, ideas of what relaxing is or could be.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, as mentioned, Leaf Blower Co. is out November 17th, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571710/Leaf_Blower_Co/">here</a>.

            <p>
It has not been a good time for Simmers recently, and that's not even touching the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recent controversial private buyout</a> that has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">led to a creator exodus</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, for a while now, has been riddled with bugs that simply make it difficult to play, prompting Maxis to outline a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/quality-of-life-roadmap">quality of life roadmap</a> in September. Part of said roadmap was delivered yesterday in a big update that introduced more than 150 community-voted fixes, as well as some free goodies!
</p>
<p>
First, the goodies. These are a collection inspired by West Africa to use in both the Create a Sim and build mode. It was made in partnership with the Pan African Gaming Group as well as some Simmers with "with direct connections to West African countries and lived experiences across the Black diaspora in the UK and North America," according to a separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/west-african-bgu">news post</a> about the collection.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new items like an Okuta Lamp with Woven Shade, an Ìtura Cushion, your Sims will now be able to cook dishes like Jollof Rice and Chicken Drumsticks, and there's new West African inspired fashion pieces like a "vibrant jumpsuit, bold patterned shirts, and a playful, printed dress for Toddlers and Children." Neat stuff!
</p>
<p>
Now, some of those fixes. If you're the kind of Simmer that likes to make your Sims woo-hoo up a family, inherited features should show up in the kids more, like if two Sims have big ears, the kid should too - though there might still be some differences occasionally, just not egregiously so.
</p><p>
There's also been an issue where Sims might put things like books or food items into something like a Sticker Storage Box rather than their more logically assigned homes (shelf, fridge), and that's been fixed. One issue that surely tickled man that saw Sims wearing hats while in their nude outfits has been fixed, though I must admit this one mostly feels like a shame. Forcibly make Sims wear hats while naked! It's funny!
</p>
<p>
And you can comfortably marry one Sim to another without fear of any fashion faux pas, as an issue where guests would wear random or work outfits if one wasn't chosen for them has been fixed too.
</p>
<p>
It's a long list of fixes, you can check out the full thing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-11-4-2025">here</a>, which covers mostly the base game, but a lot of different packs too.
