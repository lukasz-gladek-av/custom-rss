            <p>
There's a whole bunch of games set in space that let you duke it out in dogfights, form strategies around entire fleets, terraform planets, all often pretty violent acts. So, I found it very funny to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/x4-foundations">X4: Foundations</a> at the Triple-I showcase today, which received a trailer for its upcoming Diplomacy update which is literally about just talking things out. Seriously, when it says that it's introducing diplomacy it means it, as when it arrives you'll be able to send diplomats to negotiate and forge alliances so that you don't have to jump to war right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
There's a new facility, the Embassy, that you'll be able to send said diplomats to chat with other factions. On top of that there's Agents, who can "be deployed on independent assignments to achieve diplomatic objectives within the X universe." Details about the update are pretty slim outside of that, the trailer didn't give all that much away, not even a release date outside of the fact it's coming in 2025. The update will be free at the very least! Not bad for a game that'll be seven years old this November.

<p>
From an outsider's POV, it does also tickle me that this game is so old yet in a game about building a space empire, trading, fighting, all that jazz you'd expect from a sci-fi game of its ilk, the game's inhabitants never thought to just talk to each other. Oh well! Better late than never.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth pointing out that X4: Foundations is actually on sale right now, as it's only £12/ $15 down from £40/ $50. You've got until April 16th to get it at that price, no need to rush, but it might be good to get it now ahead of this upcoming update if it takes your fancy.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> has had a few crossovers in its time since releasing in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-indie-megahits-combine-in-vampire-survivors-among-us-dlc-out-later-this-month">like with Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-is-getting-guns-in-a-new-contra-crossover-gun-focused-dlc-called-operation-guns">Contra of all series</a>, and the one that felt like an inevitability, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-to-get-its-biggest-dlc-yet-an-ode-to-castlevania-with-a-sprawling-new-map">Castlevania</a>. The game's latest collab was just announced at this year's Triple-I showcase, and personally it's a bit of a head scratcher: Square Enix's SaGa series. Referred to as the Emerald Diorama update, specifically because of the most recent entry in the series Emerald Beyond, it was introduced with another lovely animated segment showing off a magical catgirl and a battery-looking robot.

I'm sure they'll mean something to someone, I've never seen them in my life, but I have fallen in love with them immediately. In terms of new gameplay stuff, this was kept pretty brief, but to summarise, there's 40+ new attacks, 16+ new characters and skins, a 7-biome new stage, and glimmer and showstopper mechanics.

On top of that, The Coop Update is dropping with this one. No, not co-op, coop! Last month poncle teased this update with a gif of a pixel art chicken being killed in a lovely looking field, and a press release confirmed that this in fact said chicken-themed update. The press release also made note of the fact that it has nothing to do with the very different local co-op mode the game already has, and that poncle are still working on online co-op. Lastly, there's a couple of new adventures, one for the base game, one for the Foscari DLC.
</p>
<p>
If you want more details, unfortunately I don't have them, but it's a free update, and it's out today! It should be noted that poncle have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/529839807839340229?l=english">previously said</a> that this update has delayed some other additions, so if there's something you're expecting, don't fret if it's not there. The developer also noted at the time that cross save progress will be coming with this update, so if you own something other than a PC, you'll be able to switch between platforms now. Neat!
