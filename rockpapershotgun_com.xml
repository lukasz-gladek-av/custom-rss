Another month, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update, again one that comes with a list of quality of life changes, but also one that comes with another surprising collaboration. Let's start with that one, which is, weirdly, a new story pack made in collaboration with Critical Role, the wildly popular actual play series. For some context, Critical Role did an official Assassin's Creed themed oneshot a little while back. In said oneshot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>'s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpp3RqWBB/">Robbie Daymond played a character called Rufino</a>, who's being added into the game through this new mission in update 1.0.6.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> explains. "While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers." Completing this quest nets you Rufino as a new ally, and you'll get the Critical Role logo as a banner.
</p>
<p>
Right, now the regular update stuff. A new nightmare difficult setting is now available with this update, which does a few different things. Defensive options are less effective in this mode, and you need to pull off perfect parries for them to deflect the hit fully. Enemy AI is "smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection." And combat resources are harder to find too.
</p>
<p>
For those of you oddly desperate to wear your headgear during cutscenes, that'll be an option now too, and there's toggles for specific types of VFX that you can turn off and on as well. The regional alert system available in castles has been expanded to the whole province on top of that, meaning that when you repeatedly attack "Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world." There's also three different camera presets when on a horse, for your riding pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for us here in PC land, there's an Ultra Low visual quality level - you can read about the exact specs that's catered to over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5qj66bYuntViG1YiqYlNJn/ac-shadows-title-update-106-release-notes">post about the update</a>, alongside the list of fixes and tweaks that you mostly don't need to worry about.

I'm not entirely sure of the cultural relevancy of Chicken Run, even if it did get one of those trendy legacy sequels back in 2023, and yet here we are with the reveal of an entire video game. The name of said game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chicken-run-eggstraction">Chicken Run: Eggstraction</a>, and quite fittingly it is an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, one that might even look quite good? 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It certainly matches the look of the films for starters, though that's not much of a surprise given that Aardman themselves are making it, with Outright Games on publishing duties. It seems that Aardman have also made some new bits of stop-motion animation just for the game too, and it looks as good as it always does, to no one's surprise.

<p>
The game is also a sequel to that aforementioned legacy sequel, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with Frizzle taking the lead this time. Josie Sedgwick-Davies is back as Frizzle, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>' Bella Ramsey returning as Molly (the chick of the original film's protagonists Ginger and Rocky) too.
</p>
<p>
How about gameplay? Well, this time around you'll be setting out to rescue chickens from the nugget industry, so missions see you embarking with different characters from the movies all with their own abilities. Levels see you having to do classic stealth game things like avoiding security cameras by hiding in traffic cones, and solving puzzles and the like. You'll also have to guide the chickens you're rescuing Pikmin style throughout the levels, so it's just as much about infiltration as it is exfiltration (or eggsfiltration, I suppose). Oh, and you can play it in co-op too!
</p>
<p>
I quite like the idea of something vaguely like Pikmin meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> meets XCOM (specifically the squad forming bit), it just looks like a silly good time. A light bit of Untitled Goose Game energy about it too. No exact release date for it just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419690/Chicken_Run_Eggstraction/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.
