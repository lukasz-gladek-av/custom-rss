            <p>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>s share something in common. Both (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a>’s Squall and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.</p>
<p>The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:</p>

<p>Gwent itself has seen a few iterations over the years. There was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">standalone online game</a> that I had some fun with for a bit, even if it shattered CDProjekt’s image as the ‘No Microtransactions, Free DLC and a Back Massage’ studio by having the most nefarious loot box animation I’d ever encountered. Then there was the rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-review">quite liked it</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the full press release <a href="https://www.hachetteboardgames.co.uk/gwent-announcement">here</a>, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year. In other Witchly news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has entered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"the most intensive phase of development</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where were you during the Summer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">free game</a> about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bandai-namco-would-like-you-to-have-a-free-dog">definitely March</a>. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.</p>

<p>There’s not much information outside that so far, I’m afraid, although it has been nice to see such a lovely reception to such a fun free offering. It shot up to ‘overwhelmingly positive’ quite quickly on Steam. My current favourite review on there describes it as a “reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>”.</p><p>The game was released with two other freebies as part of Bandai Namco’s 2023 New Employee Training Project, which lets new hires get experience and support releasing smaller projects before moving them up to bigger games. It felt like the rare ‘entirely depressing caveat free’ bit of gaming news, basically. Although I’m sure one of you bastards will find a way to ruin it for me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
