            <p>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-pc-review">the 2016 launch version No Man's Sky</a>, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s Worlds Part 2 update, there is talk of adding "billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets" to a game that already harbours more worlds than any mortal player community could ever explore, including new, somehow walkable gas giants that are "ten times bigger than our biggest planet". Also oceans so deep you can't see the sun. Please excuse me, I think my thalassophobia and agoraphobia have fused into a single sprawling fear of literally everything, "literally everything" being the title of a hypothetical No Man's Sky's update in, oh, let's say 24 months' time. Find a video below with commentary from Hello Games managing director Sean Murray.</p>

<p>Let me attempt to zoom from the terror of the macrocosm to the pleasantries of individual exploration and survival. The gas giants look a bit spesh, don't they? Going by the trailer, you'll be walking on their hard rocky cores or perhaps, hopping around on fragments of solid matter launched into their upper atmospheres. I assume they've wrangled with the problem that the gravity ought to render you two-dimensional. It predictably reminds me of Giant's Deep in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, which always used to make my knees dance a nervous jig whenever I'd fly through the clouds. The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/">official patch notes</a> may reveal more - they weren't live at the time this was written.</p><p>As for the deeper oceans, this is definitely making inroads on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>'s turf, though existing No Man's Sky oceans are pretty voluminous and atmospheric already. I am always glad to swim amongst dangling sacks of kelp. Please do not eat me, semi-randomised abyssal critters.</p>
<p>The video makes fleeting mention of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, Hello Games's forthcoming fantasy roamabout,  which takes place on one, Earth-sized planet. I continue to like that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">puckish Carrollian stylings</a>, and letting the designers and artists focus on a single, albeit vast landscape could have interesting ramifications, but the more they flesh out No Man's Sky, the harder it is to see what Light No Fire really brings to the party. Hopefully we'll get a proper demo soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.</p>
<p>The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2792340/Microtopia_Demo/">demo</a> as well? Catch the trailer below.

I like the simultaneously brain-tickling and skin-crawling presentation, which reminds me a little of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darwinia">Darwinia</a>. I also appreciate the developer's chutzpah in leapfrogging the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth">surprising amount</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-the-ants">of competition</a> in the ant-based strategy genre, which extends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scientists-use-age-of-empires-2-to-investigate-how-ants-wage-war">scientists using Age Of Empires to monitor how ants "wage war"</a>. These ain't just your regular garden-variety formicidae - they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/zachtronics">Zach</a>-ass cyborgs. Amongst other things, you can "optimize your layout by using sensors and logic gates to sort your ants based on different properties".
</p><p>
I wonder if it'll be one of those games where you can build a functioning computer inside the simulation. Mind you, it also sounds like a traditional strategy game campaign in places, with a bunch of biomes to visit as you rear new queens and send them off to colonise the setting's "world of electronic waste".</p>
<p>
Here are some bullet points from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2750000/Microtopia/">Steam page</a>. Read them quickly before they scuttle away.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- 30 different ant castes
</p>
<p>
- 45 buildings to construct
</p>
<p>
- 7 different types of trails
</p>
<p>
- 10 logic trails and gates to sort your ants
</p>
<p>
- 5 biomes to explore
</p>
<p>
- 44 material types to find and craft
</p>
<p>
- 3 full tiers of progression, each with their own missions
</p>
<p>
- 80 objectives to achieve
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to work out the implications of Cordyceps naming themselves after a fungus celebrated for turning ants into zombies. Are they secretly the game's bad guys? Can a robot succumb to parasitic mushrooms?

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sniper-at-work">Sniper At Work</a> is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179260/Kingdoms_Merge__Build/">"soothing merge-2 experiences"</a> featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.</p>
<p>You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-29">the Maw</a> that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3452800/Sniper_at_Work/">the Steam page</a>. Elevator pitch: this is a stealthy-sandboxy urban execution sim with changeable environments and a heavy emphasis on both planning and plans going awry. Why are you in an elevator? Because you are heading to the roof with your rifle, of course. Mind the CCTV. Here are some features.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tactical Planning: Scout your targets, choose your vantage points, and get creative with traps, distractions, and tools.</p>
<p>Precision Sniping: Feel the thrill of the perfect shot with realistic ballistics, wind physics, and breathing control.</p>
<p>Upgradable Arsenal: Unlock and customize sniper rifles, gadgets, and tools to handle any situation--or make them worse in the most entertaining way possible.</p>
<p>Dynamic Scenarios: Missions adapt to your decisions (and occasional missteps), keeping keeping every playthrough unpredictable.</p>
<p>Creative Freedom: Choose your approach--subtle, explosive, or delightfully ridiculous--and leave your mark in style.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not wholly convinced by the switches to elevated third-person in the trailer. I can't figure out how they fit into the rest of the game. Beyond that, yeah, more of this please. It's not as conceptually ambitious as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a>, and the developers have an uphill challenge crafting scenarios as ingenious as those of Hitman, let alone besting a direct rival like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sniper-elite-5-review">Sniper Elite</a>, but it feels like a game you shouldn't turn your back on. Especially given that it doesn't have a release date yet. They could strike at any moment.</p>
<p>Cherrypick Games are also working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949910/ANGST_A_TALE_OF_SURVIVAL/">Angst: A Tale Of Survival</a>, which is a low-poly trudge through an icy wilderness. The only cherries you shall pick here are chunks of frozen firewood.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are those ripples in your morning cappuccino? Must be the stomping feet of an ancient lizard messing up that nice whippy heart your barista made in the froth. And when I say "ancient" I mean from 1999. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> and Dino Crisis 2 have appeared on GOG, making the classic survival horror games easily (and legally) playable on the PC once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">a bundle with both games</a>, or you can get <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">the timid puzzles and exploration of the first game</a> separately from the more <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2">action-heavy shotgun blasting of the sequel</a>. Both are good times if you're a fan of digital fossils. Although if you're a console dabbler you may have already spotted these on the PlayStation store in October last year. </p>
<p>Both games have passed through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">GOG's "game preservation" process</a>, which is basically a set of performance tests and checks that GOG like to do to make sure the games are DRM-free, compatible with modern machinery, and straightforward to launch for modern players. They get a shiny sticker when they pass. The original Resident Evil trilogy appeared on GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">one</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc">one</a> (by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-3-is-now-available-via-gog-following-the-arrivals-of-its-predecessors">one</a>) via the same process.

</p><p>One side effect of remastering Dino Crisis 2 seems to be that the characters are very crisp, making its pre-rendered backgrounds look blurry by comparison. It's as if Regina here is in a zoom call with the background slightly blurred. </p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But look, here's some of the things each game has to make sure they'll work well on your PC.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11</li>
<li>New rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more).</li>
<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock 4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series, etc.) with optimal button mapping for both wired and wireless modes, including hot plugging.</li>
<li>Added Cloud Saves support.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dino Crisis is the well-liked cousin of the Resident Evil games, but has long been neglected by Capcom in comparison to the zombie-blasting series. Capcom released a poll that showed the series has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">a lot of nostalgic fans</a>. But there has been no real sign of any remake happening in the style of the Resi games. Even Shinji Mikami has said that there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">"no room" for the series to get a reboot when Monster Hunter exists</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, GOG took this moment to remind people about their <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/">"Dreamlist"</a>, a list of user-voted games people would like to see appear on the store (they're touting this as a new feature but it is essentially a nice-looking revamp of their previous "wishlist" which saw users do the same thing). Currently, another Capcom game of yore is high on the list - Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. </p>
