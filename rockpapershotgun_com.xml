            <p>Six years ago Nightdive Studios announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/20-years-after-release-system-shock-2-is-finally-getting-an-enhanced-edition">doing a remaster</a> of sci-fi sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, which they were calling System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition. But back then they were also busy working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">full-blown remake</a> of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a>. Turns out that first outing to Citadel Station took priority. But now that they're done with that, the studio has finally revealed a release date for the sequel's remaster, which they've sneakily renamed System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. </p>

<p>It's coming out June 25th this year, as revealed by Nightdive in the above trailer shown during the Future Games Show's spring showcase. As you can see this is definitely "remaster" territory as opposed to a full remake. Resuited, but not rebooted. Watch as an HD-ifying line sweeps over the screen to show before and after shots of Citadel Station and its hostile inhabitants. The changes seem fairly light-handed, too.</p>
<p>There's widescreen support, remodelled enemies, "enhanced" reload animations, and "optimized controller support" among other small improvements, we're told. Some similar improvements can already be achieved for free thanks to the game's long-standing mod scene, which lessens the impact of these tweaks a little for anyone who has already done that. The remastering studio were "paying particular attention to the co-op multiplayer" wrote news poster Craig back in 2019, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-knows-who-is-patching-system-shock-2">talking to Nightdive director Stephen Kick</a>. There doesn't appear to be any mention of co-op in the Steam blurb but the studio has previously confirmed it's still intended to appear.</p>
<p>"Multiplayer and co-op is currently in development," said the studio <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1894841847350206848">in a tweet</a> last year. "We will share more info on these and other features as we get closer to launch day."</p>
<p>System Shock 2, while beloved by many, can be quite clunky to play from a modern perspective. It'll be interesting to see whether the changes make one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the best RPGs on PC</a> more approachable. Nightdive have earned a lot of trust with the series - Jeremy expressed much love in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of the System Shock remake</a>, calling it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake." And this upcoming remaster will be free to anyone who pre-ordered that first remake, say Nightdive. So that's nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Tonight's Future Games Show obviously wasn't about any one game or studio in particular, but funnily enough, it did open and close with games from (technically) one developer. The show started things off with a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3494520/Lost_Rift/">Lost Rift</a>, a supernatural, survival, PvPvE extraction game - that's a lot of things - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/people-can-fly">People Can Fly</a>. In case you were wondering, this is what became of Project Victoria which was shelved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">only three months ago</a>. Weirdly enough, the show then ended with the series that put PCF on the map: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/painkiller">Painkiller</a>. Or, a remake of it anyway.
</p>

<p>
When I say that these two announcements were technically from one developer, I mostly do mean it in that PCF made the original gory, hellish first-person shooter, whereas this remake is being made by Anshar Studios, a studio mostly known for assisting other developers - it's helped out on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, and even People Can Fly's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a>.

The Painkiller remake looks like it'll still have plenty of enemies to mow down in increasingly brutal ways, you'd expect that of a game with a name like that, but there's some key changes here that make it more than just a fresh lick of paint. For one, there'll be four characters to play as, each with their own passive ability, and more notably, co-op will be a bigger component this time around. Makes sense with the different playable characters, though I'm normally hesitant about remakes at the best of times, so I'm curious how that emphasis will go down. There's also tarot cards that grant buffs, currencies to earn, skins to unlock, all stuff that mostly just sounds like padding, truth be told.
</p>
<p>
Painkiller doesn't have a precise release date just yet, but it's currently slated to come out sometime Fall 2025, and it's already available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Steam</a>. I guess <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> isn't guaranteed to be the biggest medieavally, gothicy boomer shooter this year after all.
