            <p>Inspired is one word for it, anyway. Still, since Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic-likes aren't exactly giving roguelite deckbuilders a run for their ubiquity, I'm broadly receptive - the warmest and most exploitable of the four gamer emotions. Stormbinders is a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> set in a fantasy land with bad weather and badder shimmering angelic eyeballs. You may recognise what it's going for. This may delight you.</p>
<p>You'll choose a hero, then get stuck into the campaign. "The story progresses across unique scenarios, uncovering a tale of magic, heroism, unlikely alliances and betrayals," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134720/Stormbinders/">reads Steam</a>. The titular Stormbinding sounds like the interesting twist here. The game randomises weather patterns each time you boot it up, which apparently adds new wrinkles to both battle and the global map.</p>

<p>As well as map exploration, treasure hunting, and hex-based battles, there's also castle management, with a nice sunny castle and flamin' metal hell castle currently shown off. "Each faction has more than 18 unique units, including legendary heroes, wise spellcasters and mystical creatures," reads Steam. "Players can customize their armies, mixing different types of units to strategically create powerful synergies of abilities".</p>
<p>Aside from that, there isn't a tonne of information, although publishers Slytherin are holding a presentation tomorrow, April 10th at 17:00 CEST/16:00 BST, featuring an "exclusive deep dive" into the game's systems.</p>
<p>No release date on this one yet, which puts it one step behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-announce-new-back-to-roots-heroes-of-might-magic-game-with-the-iratus-devs-in-charge">Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</a>.

            <p>Stock markets tanked and gaming laptops went into hiding this morning as US President Donald Trump’s globe-spanning tariffs <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cp8vyy35g3mt">came into effect</a>. Based on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/08/business/video/trump-tariffs-math-equation-wrong-economist-veuger-cnc-digvid">nonsense maths</a>, these heavy taxes on imported goods are already sowing havoc within the gaming hardware industry, leaving manufacturers – whose production operations are commonly based in China and Taiwan – to scramble together a plan. Most headlines have focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>’s US pre-orders being delayed as a result, but PC gear is very much following suit, with Razer pausing direct sales for its new Blade 16 and Blade 18 laptops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs">The Verge</a>, Razer’s pre-order pages for <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16">both</a> <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-18">laptops</a> have been replaced by a "Notify Me" button, and it’s the same story for the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-pc-accessories/razer-adjustable-laptop-stand">Razer Adjustable Laptop Stand</a>, which was only announced yesterday. All three products are still available on Razer’s UK site at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Razer haven’t confirmed this un-selling as a direct result of the taxes, instead taking a no-comment approach. Yet the timing does stink a little of the fact that China and Taiwan, where Razer has its factories, are now subject to levies of 32% and 104% respectively. And again, they wouldn’t be the first. Besides the Switch 2, repairable laptop maker Framework have "temporarily" paused sales in the US as well.</p>
<p>“Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions,” <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1909320405627580621">Framework claimed in a Xeet</a>, “though most have not been open about it.”</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Razer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic dilemma faced by hardware makers, or at least the majority who need to import parts or whole products to the US, is whether to tank the extra costs (in order to keep their wares at pre-tariff prices), or to pass those costs onto consumers, resulting in potentially painful hikes. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/micron-impose-tariff-related-surcharge-some-products-april-9-sources-say-2025-04-08/">Reuters report</a> that Micron, who produce memory chips for a range of consumer SSDs, RAM modules, and laptops, have already chosen the latter for some of their products.</p>
<p>If these tariffs stay in place, it could therefore end up being a rough few years for PC owners in need of upgrades, with even American firms like Nvidia relying on Taiwanese semiconductors. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), a US-based trade association the represents Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, EA, Epic, and other gaming giants, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">have warned</a> that the policy is “going to have a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry," and previously wrote an <a href="https://www.theesa.com/the-esa-joins-multi-association-coalition-letter-to-united-states-trade-representative-greer-on-risks-of-tariffs-to-american-innovation-and-technology/">open letter</a> to the US government decrying its risks.</p>
<p>One argument in defence of these tariffs, sparking from the last square inch of US lawmaker brain matter that isn’t clogged up with Cheetos dust, is that they’ll encourage locally-based companies to move their production stateside, creating new jobs aplenty. This, of course, fails to account for the lengthy timespan of building new factories, their enormous material cost, or the talent crunch that would occur when loads of big orgs suddenly need to hire specialist technical staff simultaneously. All of which would likely result in... higher prices for the consumer.</p>
<p>I like to think that us PC types are a hardy folk that have endured plenty of money troubles before, including the great graphics card gouging of 2020 or more recent upticks in SSD prices. Still, those were caused (at least largely in part) by properly Biblical catastrophes like plague and floods. This is, just, stupid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have announced their next gig as a fledgling games publisher. They're palling up with MythicOwl to release the latter's jaunty delivery sim Truckful, in which absolutely nothing waits for you in the woods. In which there are no ghost trucks. In which "hidden paths, misty wetlands, unforgiving marshes and dusty quicksands [do not] tell the stories of the past, waiting to be discovered". Here's a trailer.

<p>
At first blush, Truckful is a jolly 3D roadster with boisterous cargo physics, viewed from a slanted side-on perspective. It's about stacking your flatbed high with loose objects such as pianos and vases, then trying to transport them safely across the rough roads of this idyllic countryside setting.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me a bit of the village where I grew up, except that there don't seem to be as many obnoxious middle-aged townies on racing bicycles, though you do encounter a lot of chatty pedestrians, some of whom need a lift. The local forest also reminds me of the scrawny oak copses down the road from my childhood home, except that I don't recall the roots being big enough to drive up, and I don't remember the sun ever vanishing like a swallowed candle. Definitely some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">metsänpeitto</a> going on hereabouts. Ooh, who's that peering between the boughs? Yeah, best not stop for directions. Focus on delivering the piano.
</p>
<p>
Having Pocketpair on board as publisher means that MythicOwl have more money to blow on bonus moving parts. "With Pocketpair's support, you can expect that many great gameplay features we were cooking during past couple months, will make it the game as its development is now fully funded &amp; secure," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">a Steam post</a>. "We're testing truckloads (!) of new stuff - locations, quests, characters, upgrades &amp; unlockables - so make sure to stay tuned to our social and community channels for more content!" I will forgive you that whoopee-cushion parenthesis if you'll forgive me for saying that you should have called this Cormac McCosy's The Road.
</p>
<p>
I guess the nearest parallel for this both mood-wise and in terms of the cargo-stacking mechanics is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>. Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">other publishing joint</a> that I know about is an untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about the entertainment industry from Surgent Studios, creators of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.

            <p>'18 Wheels Of Thunder' boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racin</a>g's original <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/">box art</a>, in a font forged from guitar pedals, light beer, and divorce papers. Flames jet from the snout of the marauding 'rig like snorted breakfast tequila following an especially piquant ex-wifely punchline. A rammed police car flails uselessly against the sheer girth of but one of those 18 thunderous wheels. Perhaps we might imagine a single tear trickling down the exasperated coparoo's cheek. As we reach out to wipe it from the case, we unwittingly dissolve the '1' from the tagline, leaving us with only '8'.</p>
<p>The 8 remains, smugly, for two decades. 8 is the Metacritic score for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. That is so incredibly powerful that words fail me. Not for Metacritic, meaningless institution run by and for leprous prestige weasels that it is. It's powerful for Big Rigs. To get less than a 61 on Metacritic, a game must either be so brazenly committed to its own bizarre artistic vision that it fizzles the minds of lesser critics like Skittles in lemonade, or simply be unplayable wank. I have read a lot of evidence that points toward the latter, but that can't be true, or it wouldn't <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/">be on Steam</a>, right?

<p>"Get ready for some brake jamm'in, CB talk'in, convoy roll'in action across America," screams the trailer, with all the hammy revisionism of Tommy Wiseau labelling The Room "a dark comedy" after the fact.  It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, in case that wasn't clear, although Steam also has it tagged as 'psychological horror'. I'd call Steam users out for only having, like, two jokes but they're basically working with fridge magnet poetry so it's a noble effort. You'll drive one of four 'rigs over five tracks, hauling loads and trying to stay one step ahead of johnny lawman. Oh, you thought this was <em>regular</em> driving action? Hillarious. This is "non-stop driving action", you pitiful cornflake. </p>
<p>Is this new release in better shape than the original? Or, to put it another way, does it actually function? Reviews have it at a light-to-medium 'still mostly busted'. There are also a few complaints about an allegedly dodgy installer wizard. Interestingly, the current custodians do at least seem interested in keeping it playable. It's already received a few patches addressing fatal errors, the most recent of which arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Following the game's disastrous release in 2003, producer 	Sergey Titov <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-2/">apparently offered</a> to personally replace any copies sent to him with a game of the buyer's choice from the Activision Value Catalog. Only 20 people took him up on it. I'd imagine the likely culprit here is malaise, although perhaps these thunderous wheels really do have an undeniable magnetism; a primeval, electric pull that writhes infinitely, like a big fat Metacritic eight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
