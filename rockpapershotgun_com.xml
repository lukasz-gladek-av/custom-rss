            <p>PUBG: Blindspot, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> spin-off previously dubbed Project Arc, is set to take the early access plunge on February 5th, 2026. In case you've understadably started wondering if this is the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> which prompted my last bit of newsing about a PUBG spin-off, it isn't. That's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-black-budget-is-an-extraction-shooter-spin-off-with-an-island-trapped-in-time-loop-of-supernatural-munching">PUBG: Black Budget</a>, PUBG: Blindspot's all about fights in which you're staring at the tops of folks' heads.</p>

<p>Blindspot's the one which got a Steam demo last year, shedding its Project Arc moniker around that time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pubg-developers-new-pvp-shooter-looks-like-top-down-rainbow-six-siege-with-a-bit-of-hotline-miami">Ed Thorn</a> (RPS in peace) likened it to a "top-down Rainbow Six Siege with a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>" based on the initial trailer. The latest look at it, which I've embedded above, shows of more of the shootouts in confined rooms and coridoors which fuelled that view.</p>
<p>This time, there's a throbbing grime beat pulsating as the battlers get up to tactical hijinks in the name of cutting off each others' sightlines. Think a less lonely Escape from Duckov, but made by people who always buy the entire aisle of heavy-duty tape and wooden planks whenever they visit a hardware store.</p><p>Armed with that sort of gubbins, the mission of you and your team of up to five fellow Plunkbatters is to hack into each building's hidden Crypt by installing a decrypter. One side are tasked with going the offensive to reach the crypt and hack it, with the other are tasked with holding ground and defending it while they do the same.</p>
<p>The team behind Blindspot say the early access version - which is set to be free-to-play - will focus on nailing the core experience, with a 5v5 online PvP match base getting regular system refinements, class/weapon balance passes, and new additions. They've not put forth any figures in terms of how long early access'll last, instead saying that'll "depend on development progress and player feedback". As such, the full launch'll happen whenever they feel the thing's ready for it.</p>
<p>While Blindspot'll be free to try out of the gates next month, Krafton do make clear that "after the official release, we plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items".</p>
<p>If you fancy giving it a go, top-down Plunkbat's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>The world could certainly do with another game about slapping up Swastika-wearers right now. Thankfully, having finished off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are reportedly working on the previously teased Wolfenstein 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku</a>. The former also claim the studio have a mysterious multiplayer game in the mould of Rainbow Six Siege on their plate.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein 3 being a thing Machine have moved on to post-Indy isn't all that surprising. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-devs-machinegames-tease-another-wolfenstein-game-we-have-a-story-to-tell">last year</a>, a documentary about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a>, saw studio head Jerk Gustafsson mention having plans for a third entry which rounds out B.J. Blazkowicz's Nazi-blasting tale.</p>
<p>"That journey for B.J., even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [B.J.], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," he said. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>How a game developed by a studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">owned by Microsoft</a> and tasked with satirising Fascism as real-world far-right regimes continue to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/08/ukraine-war-briefing-allies-no-cast-iron-security-guarantees-yet">wage expansionist wars</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry">kidnap the leaders of nations</a> that happen to have oil in order to swiftly establish control, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/the-us-complicit-genocide-israel-gaza">support genocides</a> will fare is something that'll be intriguing to see. That said, not shying away from such challenges is the duty of any good satirist.</p>
<p>The same challenge'll be faced by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV Series</a> that's currently in the works at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish">Amazon</a>, which this next Wolfenstein will probably go hand-in-hand with in the name of corporate synergy. That's assuming the folks behind the adaptation are interested in taking it on.</p>

            <p>A preliminary employment tribunal hearing has seen the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) request that a judge grant interim relief to the 31 UK-based GTA 6 developers fired by Rockstar, reportedly following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">discussion of changes to Rockstar's company Slack policies</a> by staff on Discord. The union, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company over the dismissals last year, continue to assert that they were a form of union busting. Rockstar, meanwhile, have released a fresh statement claiming that the root of this is simply stopping info about GTA 6 from leaking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If this interim relief requested by the IWGB as they represented the fired devs during the preliminary hearing at Scotland's Glasgow Tribunals Centre on January 5th is granted, the workers would receive support designed to prevent them running into financial problems while both sides wait for the date of a full hearing to be set. In this case, if the relief's granted, the staff will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have any necessary work visas reinstated during the time it takes the full hearing date to be penned in.</p>
<p>As outlined on <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/interim-relief">the website</a> of the UK's Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), deciding whether to grant interim relief involves an employment tribunal looking into the facts of what the fired employee claims and making a judgement as to whether they're likely to win at the full hearing. "Likely to win means having a 'pretty good chance', not just 'more likely than not'. Interim relief applications are usually about complex issues, so meeting the 'pretty good chance' threshold can be difficult," ACAS write.</p>
<p>The preliminary hearing's also see both the IWGB and Rockstar share their versions of the story again in statements to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims">IGN</a>. "No matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of the case we have brought against Rockstar Games," the IWGB said, once again accusing Rockstar of union busting. "We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing."</p><p>Rockstar, meanwhile, once again denied the union's union busting accusations, asserting that this has all been about preventing GTA 6 leaks. In this case, the company specified to IGN that it believes that info about GTA 6's features, comments about how its development is progressing, and timelines to its launch were at risk of going public and potentially affecting Take-Two's share price.</p>
<p>"We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled," Rockstar said. "Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will."</p>
<p>Amid that slightly flex-heavy chatter, the studio also denied firing any staff who "posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies" and said they don't keep a "blacklist" of union members.</p><p>

We'll see whether the fired devs request for interim relief's granted, as this story which has attracted attention from UK politicians - including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">Prime Minister Keir Starmer</a> - rumbles on.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> may not yet be “content complete”, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg’s scooper-dooper journoman Jason Schreier, and he would not be “super shocked” if the new Miami-set <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> were delayed again, though he thinks the current 19th November 2026 release date is relatively solid.</p><!--more-->
<p>Before we Press X to Jason, it's time for an exciting recap montage of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> release setbacks. Back in May 2024, Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">narrowed</a> an initial GTA 6 2025 launch window to fall 2025, with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">commenting</a> in November that “we are highly confident in that timing”, despite mounting rumours that the new GTA would slip back.</p>
<p>Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">reiterated that confidence</a> in February 2025. Three months later, Take-Two and Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">delayed GTA 6</a> to May 26th 2026. Then in November 2025, the publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">shoved it back to November this year</a>.</p>
<p>None of this is massively surprising – videogames are messy productions and GTA games are both vast in scope and burdened by radioactive levels of expectation. Still, pour one out for the other developers who’ve been dancing back and forth with their own release dates, in a bid to avoid getting sat on by Rockstar’s glossy crime bonanza.</p><p>Schreier thinks GTA 6 might run into another delay, based on his most recent conversations with sources (he didn't give an exact timeframe). “I mean, this is how Rockstar works, or at least has worked in recent decades, I suppose in the last decade with Red Dead 2,” he observed in an interview with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=JIwZIRXoTgWdYv4d1D14OA&amp;pi=EqnPagS3R0iu_&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=aabde7b92a5d4dbe&amp;flow_ctx=9ae1964a-027a-44b9-b7f0-fa9bc4e75989%3A1767884945#login">The Ringer-Verse Button Mash podcast</a>. “If you look at the history there, they announced it for fall 2017, then it slipped the spring 2018 and then it slipped again to fall 2018 and there it landed October of that year.”</p>
<p>“So I wouldn't be super shocked if that is what happens again this time around,” Schreier continued. “This is a big and complicated game and the last I heard it was still not content complete. That is to say that people were still finishing things up, still finalising levels and missions, and seeing what's going to make it into the game. Typically the way that game development works, you have your feature complete, your content complete, your bug-testing phases.</p>
<p>“And there's a lot of boundaries blurred along the way, in all of those different stages, but they are still still making stuff. And we'll hopefully be done with that soon and just have a whole bunch of time for fixing bugs. But even during those phases, there's always someone who wants to sneak in some last minute stuff. So it's really hard to say.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that “I don’t think anyone in Rockstar could tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November, but I think this feels a little bit more real than fall 2025 did.
That was never real and even more real than May [2026] did.”</p><p>In discussion of GTA 6’s release delays, Zelnick has repeatedly lauded Rockstar for chasing “perfection”. It’s a bit of a double-edged compliment, needless to say. Perfection may be undefinable, but any perceptible imperfections here are going to have steep financial consequences.</p>
<p>“With a game like this, the stakes are so high, they really can't settle for anything less than perfection with this release, because there's so much riding on it,” Schreier continued on the podcast. “The stock of Take Two lives or dies on this game - every time this game slips, their shares drop 10%, I should say. So yeah, it's not something that they will release in any sort of compromised state. So even if it comes to like October and they're like, you know, the game is not 100% ready, I suspect they would rather slip than release it.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that by picking a November date, Rockstar and Take Two have given themselves a little breathing room to get the game out before Take-Two’s fiscal 2027 earnings report in March 2027. “Obviously they would want to be out for the holiday season and Black Friday and all the beautiful Christmas sales that they always do. But I think they have a little bit of buffer to next March if they still want to release the game within the fiscal year.”</p>
<p>All of this risks being academic to us Rock Paper Shotgunners, because GTA 6 has still yet to be formally confirmed for PC. Schreier had little to say about possible PC dates, but did observe that GTA 6 is a particularly big game for PlayStation, with sales on Xbox “almost a non-factor” by comparison. “In some ways it's kind of like a PlayStation exclusive, in that most of the sales will be on PlayStation and it will sell a lot of PlayStation 5s alongside it. So I suspect that Sony is planning its entire calendar around GTA and will not release anything within the blast zone.” This is useful intel, inasmuch as we can deduce Rockstar’s thinking from Sony’s movements.</p><p>Even as other developers, publishers and players gear up for this November’s GTAppening, Rockstar North face a legal challenge in the UK from former GTA 6 developers, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">say they were ousted for forming a union</a>. Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">contend that the fired developers were leaking confidential information</a> on a Discord forum. In a rare display of having an opinion publicly, UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">"a deeply concerning case"</a> that deserves further government investigation.</p>
