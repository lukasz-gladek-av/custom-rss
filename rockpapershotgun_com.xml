            <p>Let's face it, nothing important happens in December. I'm scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it's no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.
</p>
<p>The games that slipped are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

<p>I enjoyed the in memoriam section for games that released this year which can therefore no longer be delayed, all of which are currently available at a discount via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital/sale/autumnsale2024">Devolver's autumn sale on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Baby Steps is the pick of the Delayed Three that I'm most looking forward to. It's a literal walking simulator from Bennett Foddy and the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a> in which you pilot limbs individually to steer your pyjama-clad protagonist up a mountain, like a marriage between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>, and whichever third-person game with a mountain you care to choose from. Skyrim? Jusant? I bet God Of War's got a mud-soaked hill in it somewhere.
</p><p>Skate Story is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater if Tony Hawk was a demon made out of glass. Stick It To The Stickman is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4wzwYeZ0Y">Flash animation you watched 20 years ago</a> but with a physics simulation and made by the Broforce developers. I want to play both of these games, too.
</p>
<p>Check out the graphic design on these bad boys. The blurriness on the image of the mini roll isn't my camera, that's actually how it looks on the box.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a> prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slipways-review">polished to a fine shine in its full release</a>.
</p>
<p>All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can play Solitomb in <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">your browser for free right now</a>. 
</p>
<p>Hit the how-to-play button in-game to <a href="https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/12080108/tutorial/index.html">go to this webpage</a>, which is the basic tutorial. If you've played solitaire before, the very basics are familiar: there are stacks of cards spread at the top of the screen, with some facing upwards. After that just about everything else is different.
</p><p>The cards themselves represent either the different types of monster you can fight, or the attack, shield, and potions you can take into that fight. The number on each card represents its efficacy. You build stacks of up to five cards - any lower numbered card can be placed on top of another - and drag them into your hand to start the fight. The aim is to defeat a certain number of a certain kind of enemy or to clear a pathway forward in order to reach the next level of the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Which probably all sounds a little abstract, but makes sense almost as soon as you start playing. Want to defeat a beast of five strength? Pair it with a sword of five strength. Want to win the fight without taking damage? Add a shield of 4 strength and a potion of 1 or higher, and drag all four cards together into your hand. Now do this again and again to clear all the cards in front of you, making sure not to squader power on lesser battles, to run out of health, or to run out of attack cards altogether.
</p>
<p>There are umpteen other systems layered atop this basic combat math. The dungeon houses an impatient demon and if you make too many dragging and stacking moves before you trigger combat, you'll start to take damage. There are damage bonuses for combos, such as cards of the same suit, rank or consecutive ranks. You choose a character class before a run, with a passive buff and a special ability, and there's a between-level shop for purchasing new cards and upgrades. Later floors introduce new card types. Prototype or not, it already seems rich in strategic potential.
</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://krajzeg.itch.io/solitomb">the Solitomb page on Itch to give it a try</a>. Or if you never got around to trying Slipways, you can pick that for half price right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264280/Slipways/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Announced last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-rally-championship">Exo Rally Championship</a> does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>'s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.
</p>
<p>Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

<p>This is no rally game reskin, but takes full advantage of the setting. The landscapes you're speeding across are vast and unforgiving, crater-marked, littered with boulders, and battered by rain, lightning and meteors. It's only possible to make your way across them because your six-wheel-drive rover can catch considerable airtime on the low-gravity planets.
</p><p>Land too hard and you'll lose a wheel or other valuable part of your machine, however. That's where air jets come in, which let you shunt your buggy around in mid-air to correct your orientation or soften your touchdown. The tutorials take you through using them in different scenarios, and it's a lot to consider. Enough that it's simultaneously intimidating but exciting to see what dedicated players can wring from these physics.
</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast to what I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">Exo One review</a>, a game which I felt lacked friction after you'd got to grips with its comparatively simple controls. Exo Rally Championship seems to have friction in spades, and promises a rich simulation with the ability to tune your rover, the need to repair it, and with tire and fuel types to match to different planetary destinations in the full game.
</p>
<p>That full game is still "coming soon", but you can grab the demo now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262020/Exo_Rally_Championship/">from Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
