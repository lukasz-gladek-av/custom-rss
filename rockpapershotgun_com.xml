        <p>Along with basically every sci-fi universe of note</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pilestedt pitched the Trench Crusade crossover last week in a Xitter reply. The debonair vultures of <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-cco-wants-crossover-sickest-thing-imaginable/">Videogamer</a> subsequently swooped in and did an article about it, which Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932">has also replied to</a>. "Yeah, but these are just musings," he qualified, noting that stirring too many or the wrong kind of third-party license into the Helldivers world might "dilute the IP". 
</p>
<p>
While this might read like an attempt to stave off further reporting, Piletstedt simply couldn't help sharing "an extended list of IPs that I really would love to do a take on", which the jolly jackals of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-creative-boss-doesnt-want-to-dilute-it-with-crossovers-but-his-list-of-dream-choices-has-some-real-deep-cuts/">PCGamer</a> have seized in their slavering jaws. And now, we're writing it up too. What kind of creature is Rock Paper Shotgun in this particular Attenborough scenario? We are <em>bugs</em>, of course. We are a horde of alien insects, emerging triumphantly from our burrows to chew upon the carcass of this story. Without further ado, here's Pilestedt's list.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Aliens
</p>
<p>
- Starship Troopers
</p>
<p>
- Terminator
</p>
<p>
- Predator
</p>
<p>
- Star Wars
</p>
<p>
- Fifth Element
</p>
<p>
- Blade Runner
</p>
<p>
- Warhammer 40k
</p>
<p>
- Trench Crusade
</p>
<p>
- Mutant Chronicles
</p>
<p>
- Dropzone Commander
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You could argue that there are already bits and pieces of those in Helldivers 2 as it stands. Starship Troopers is, of course, the book-and-movie franchise Helldivers takes inspiration from. The game's satirical forever-war fiction is basically 40K but without the crenelations and waxen seals. The Terminator, Alien and Predator loom large in the design of Helldivers enemy factions. Still, I see a few untapped possibilities here that might take Helldivers in fascinating directions. Here's a brief list.
</p>
<p>
- Do a Terminator expansion where one of your team-mates could be a Terminator in a skinsuit. Most of my team-mates are trying to kill me anyway.
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to add xenomorphs, make it so they can abduct Helldivers and cocoon them, giving colleagues a window of time in which to rescue them before they're facehugged
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to do Warhammer 40K, don't just add Space Marines. Give us the option of turning ourselves into Dreadnoughts when we die. Also, endow each map with an ambient level of warp activity, with demons emerging if you commit too much heresy (e.g. by drop-podding your comrades)
</p>
<p>
- As for Starship Troopers, let us talk to the bugs using telepathy. It's what Edge would want, and it actually happens at the end of the  Verhoeven film. Spoilers, I guess!!!!!

            <p>Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you're saying it's a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.</p>

<p>As you’ll see from the trailer above, Acts Of Blood channels the relentless martial arts beatdowns of films like The Raid. What’s a little less obvious, due to all the cuts, is how the combat doesn’t quite flow together as well as I’d hoped. It’s smooth enough to play, although there’s a fair few canned counter and finisher animations that don’t play especially nice with whatever the other enemies are doing at the time, resulting in a bit of janky disconnect. Still, I found myself won over by some very smooth performance, some lovely kick combos, and how fun it was to lob fire axes across the room for some very decisive kills.</p>
<p>You can see how you feel about this yourself, anyway, since there’s a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/">on Steam here</a>. Here’s the story setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the bustling city of Bandung, Hendra's life is torn apart when his family is slain by his father's business rival. Left alone and seeking justice, the college law student finds no help from the corrupt legal system that protects the killers. Discovering a powerful group behind the attack, Hendra decides to take revenge himself, determined to make them pay for their actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Features include “Dynamic Brutal Combat” (yes to brutal, rain check on dynamic), “Various Melee &amp; Firearm Weapons”, “Destructible Environmental Elements”, “Traditional Parkour” (you can slide on things), and “Outfit Customization”. Misgivings aside, I got a good 20 minutes of fun out of it, and I reckon it’s worth the &lt;3GB download, if just to throw an axe at someone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Putting aside my natural annoyance at<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel <em>too</em> far away. Good news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> fans, and perhaps <em>gooder news</em> for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.</p>
<p>Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-voice-actors-confirm-that-the-remake-will-have-new-dialogue/">Automaton West</a>.</p>

<p>The video features Benson, The Boss actor Lori Alan, and David Hayter, talking shop about reprising their roles for the MGS 3 remake. Konami have previously said that Delta will use the original game’s VO in its entirety, but it sounds like there’s actually some new dialogue, too. At around 11:50 in the video, Hayter asks his co-stars about their experience doing “some of the new lines”. Alan and Benson then go on to talk about stepping back in the recording booth to revisit their characters from 20 years ago.</p><p>Benson, when asked why she used a pseudonym for the original Snake Eater, says that the project’s voice director suggested the name change due to the other “family based, children based” projects Benson was involved with at the time. The ‘Suzetta Miñet’ pseudonym was based on her pet dog, Suzette Monet.</p>
<p>There’s lots of other lovely anecdotes in the full video, and it’s worth watching just for how proud Hayter looks of himself when he replies to Benson’s story of keeping a copy of Snake Eater in her basement with “in a box!”.</p>
<p>While, again, there’s no solid release date as of yet, a hastily deleted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leak-suggests-a-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-exactly-20-years-after-the-original">Gamestop Xitter post this June</a> did list a 17th November release date - exactly 20 years after the original, although that does feel considerably less likely now we’re so close.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
