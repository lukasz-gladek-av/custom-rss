Do youâ€¦ do you hear that? Can you feel it? That disgusting, gnawing feeling, a shiver down your spine because you know it's coming for youâ€¦ the Steam summer saleâ€¦ Friends, Romans, country(insert pronoun here), it is unfortunately that time of year again, that time where you look at all of those games in your wishlist as you try to figure out which deal is the best, and which to leave for the next inevitable sale.
</p>

<p>
Personally, there are far too many games in my wishlist that I'd like to buy now but I am also supposedly an Adult with Responsibilities, so I will try to refrain from picking anything up. Besides, that backlog isn't getting any shorter and my lifespan isn't getting any longer. Still! The mortifying concept of ego and literal death aside, I'm still going to make mention of a few notable games that have some healthy discounts, if only to make you think "oh yeah I've been meaning to play that."

For starters, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Death Stranding is 60% off</a> making it only Â£14, and considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s inevitable PC release is nowhere in sight, you might as well relieve some of that FOMO. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/">Elden Ring is quite a healthy 40% off</a> at Â£30, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/">so is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, making it Â£39</a>. Possible future GOTY and frequent discourse starter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a smaller discount of 10% off</a>, but that still makes it Â£38. Last year's actual GOTY <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/">UFO 50 is also only Â£16.80</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really want something cheap as chips, the groovy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer is as low as Â£1.27</a>. Heavily lesbian visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/">Heaven Will Be Mine is only Â£2.27 as well</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/">Robocop: Rogue City is Â£4.49</a>.
</p>
<p>
Point is, there's too many damn games that are really cheap right now. I'm sure you'll figure out your budget somehow.

I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne</a> is one of those games that will always be at least just a little bit relevant, in some shape or form. There are other indie games I'd rather play more than it from its era, but it kind of feels like the best representation of that period in indie games too. Throwback pixel art, a unique spin on both bullet hells and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, a bangin' soundtrack, it's got the right mix of things to help it stand the test of time. And here we are now, the game approaching its 10th anniversary, arriving with a new update.
</p>

<p>
To be specific, it's a new beta build, so it's only there if you want to try it out, but it is available right now. Don't go expecting massive features or additions or anything though, this is a quality of life update. To that end, here's what it includes! For starters there's now 60 or 120fps support, for those of you that care about that sort of thing (look, most games just don't need 60fps, alright).

</span></p><p>
There's also new aspect ratios, and a new controls menu too, but to find out the exact changes there you'll have to take a look for yourself. "Oh, and a new Melting loading screen tip", the post rounds off, alongside a very cool emoji wearing sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
If you want access to this update, your steps are pretty simple: right click on Nuclear Throne in your Steam library, click properties, then betas, then select "openbeta_win64", and Bob's your uncle, the update is ready and waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
Vlambeer explain in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/242680/view/528724684296945991?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the update that they plan to add all these improvements into the main game too, as well as more than what's mentioned above, so don't feel like you have to rush for it.
