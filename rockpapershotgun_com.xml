The report follows <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1883938087446995432">teases made by the official Sims account on X</a> as part of a 25th anniversary celebrations roadmap, as well as a few other scattered hints in various bits of promo as collated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i1frue/the_sims_1_2_and_3_might_be_rereleasing_for_the/">Redditor skyline7284</a>. "According to a source familiar with the plans, both games will be released digitally on PC later this week," write Kotaku.</p>

<p>The first two Sims games released in 2000 and 2004 respectively, but neither domestic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation game</a> has been easy to play on PC for years. Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) had to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/returning-to-the-sims-1-in-2023-is-a-weird-challenge-i-fully-recommend">install The Sims on a Windows Vista machine</a> from 2008 to revisit it in 2023, and the Sims 2 has long been offline, with the last digital copies removed from sale in 2014 around the time that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> released.</p>
<p>The next Sims thing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">Project Rene</a>, is still in development, although EA have said that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">won't be Sims 5</a>, technically. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">they blogged last</a> September. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."</p>
<p>Paradox cancelled their own Sims competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> last year, and laid off staff following what one developer called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-devs-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-prior-to-closure-says-laid-off-designer-despite-their-sim-like-exceeding-paradoxs-expectations">"a month in purgatory"</a>. They've since said they'd like to take another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">crack at a similar game</a>.</p></div>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outside-the-blocks">Outside The Blocks</a> is a diorama <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> so beautiful I was initially distrustful of it, as if it was some sort of dazzling carnivorous plant trying to lure me in to munch on my hands. I've had a play of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350220/Outside_the_Blocks/">Steam demo</a> now, and am happy to report that it's still very beautiful, and also that I still have hands: an incredible victory on all counts.</p>

<p>Outside The Blocks touts itself as "the ultimate playground for builders and creators who want to express their artistic side in a relaxing, stress-free environment. Forget about objectives and pressure—immerse yourself in the pure joy of creation". You're free to construct lovely buildings using either granular block-plonking or a tool that lets you manipulate big chunks. Once you've finished with your buildings, you can pop down tufts, streams, pigs, and whatever else you fancy. Or, you could just mess around sculpting foliage for ages, which is what I did.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend the Steam logs, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350220/view/501687870051844705">this one</a> where developer Michał Kubas charts his visit to the small French town of Troyes "renowned for its beautifully preserved timber-framed buildings", all to gather references for modular building blocks. "I gathered 1,750 references of interesting buildings, which I meticulously analyzed and broke down into appropriate modules," writes Kubas. "I can confidently say that the vast majority of them could easily be reconstructed in my game!"</p>
<p>Some features. Terrain features, if you will:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bases &amp; Glass Domes: Frame your masterpiece in style.</li>
<li>Nature Elements &amp; Organic Objects: Add life and vibrancy to your scenes.</li>
<li>Advanced Terrain Editing: Shape the ground to match your imagination.</li>
<li>Epoxy Resin: Easily add water levels for stunning aquatic effects.</li>
<li>Weather Conditions &amp; Lighting Schemes: Set the perfect mood and atmosphere.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I especially love the recreation of epoxy resin techniques - an old modelling trick for creating realistic-looking bodies of water complete with surf I'm familiar with through Warham. This one's TBA for a full release date. And, yep, it includes a photo mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dauntless">Dauntless</a> have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The studio has been owned by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">secretive blockchain company Forte</a> since some time in 2023. Since that year Phoenix Labs have seen three other rounds of layoffs. The studio saw 140 job cuts in May last year, while 34 jobs were axed back in December 2023. Before that, the company cut loose 9 percent of their workers in May 2023.</p>
<p>Over the same period there has been growing player dissatisfaction with Dauntless, which was generally well received when it first arrived. Edwin called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-preview">"Monster Hunter for people who fear grind"</a>. But recent player reviews complain that free-to-play business tactics have been increasingly interfering with basic design of the game. The game has been on PC and other platforms since 2019 but its arrival to Valve's shopfront in December last year came with a big update called "Awakening".</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of changes, this update included the bizarre decision to essentially wipe every player's character progression and weapon collections to zero. As you might expect, the game quickly attained an "overwhelmingly negative" review average on the store. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, this update was criticised by the studio's former associate producer, Jessie Leigh Gagnon, who said it was no longer "free to slay" in complaints spotted by <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/329756/former-dauntless-associate-producer-criticizes-awakening-update-for-gutting-core-mechanics">TechPowerUp</a>.</p>
<p>"They’ve gutted the core gameplay and crafting mechanics," she said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271577078045540352/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. "The essence of the Slayers (who I named just over ten years ago), has been, in fact, slayed to ribbons. We never would have made decisions that are so blatantly not player focused."   </p><p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/603016424736163000">soon apologised for the way the update was handled</a>, and recognised player distaste for the progress wipe and other changes. They handed out in-game currency and XP as part of this apology, saying that they would work to make things better. "We recognize the need to rebuild trust and improve how we engage with our community," they said. It's hard to see how this might now happen - it's possible even the person who wrote these words is now unemployed.</p>
<p>"We will share more details in the coming weeks," say Phoenix Labs about the future of Dauntless (and the studio's other game, Stardew-like farming simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>). But whatever they say it will be hard to take at face value, given that previous statements insisted the studio's games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-and-fae-farm-devs-lay-off-34-people-but-insist-dlc-plans-and-unannounced-games-unaffected">would be "unaffected" by the periodic layoffs</a>. 

</p><p>On top of these concerns, we also have to remember that behind Phoenix Labs there stands an inscrutable blockchain company in the shadows, smoking the world's forests and typing decisions nobody can see into an iPhone. When Forte bought the studio, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">reportedly instructed management</a> at Phoenix Labs not to tell anybody that the blockchain group were the new owners. Which is, uh, I believe the business term is:  fucked up. </p>
<p>Forte's only other game studio during that time were the mobile game developers Rumble Games. They were shut down by the blockchain company in July last year. </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> community was briefly awash with rumours than publisher NetEase were playing 4D chess with their hero-loving hearts last week, according to a new report by Michael Cripe for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">Ian Games</a> The rumours began in a Discord for the team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> named Marvel Rivals Leaks, where user Keone speculated that NetEase were seeding fake information on upcoming heroes for dataminers to find.</p>

<p>"It has come to our attention that the devs have set up fake characters to catch leakers," wrote Keone in the Discord. "Not only the ones in the code - but potentially inside sources too". They then gave a list of previously rumoured heroes they now believed were "very likely fake", including Quicksilver, Professor X, and Paste Pot Pete, who I hadn't heard of until now and suddenly I have a renewed interested in Marvel.</p>
<p>The Discord, says the report, had previously found some success catching heroes before their official announcement, such as the Fantastic Four. The rumour gained some traction before reaching datamining group X0XLeak, who weren't so convinced. "Could they be intended troll by NetEase? I guess,” an X0XLeak spokesninja told IGN. "Would it make sense, in my opinion? No. The way I see it, they could have made it way easier if their goal was to troll us.” They also posted <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227">an X thread</a> as evidence that the rumoured-then-unrumoured heroes existed in the game's code, thoroughly re-rumouring them once again. From IGN's report:</p>
<blockquote><p>X0X’s matfacio told IGN that, if NetEase had truly tucked away bait to trick leakers in this way, it would need to know exactly how dataminers are rummaging through the Marvel Rivals backend, explaining: “I think it would require reverse engineering a reverse engineer.”</p>
<p>The existence of new, hidden hero names in Marvel Rivals doesn’t totally poor cold water on the idea that the developers are attempting to mislead, but some believe the studio would have to go through a lot of trouble — likely more trouble than it’s worth — just to keep the more dedicated fans on their toes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That "trouble" includes things like datamined voice line events and gameplay tags, which some community members reckoned represented <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1882535375387697271">far too much work</a> to be part of an elaborate hoax. Keone did end up amending their initial stance, saying that their post spread beyond their control before they could make edits.</p><p>"The primary assumption from the main leakers (separate from me, the ones who have most info) now is that the ‘plants’ are in fact still real. And the developers did not intend for us to find them," Keone says. "That's why I edited the original post and since deleted it, and have worked to help clear up confusion surrounding it."</p>
<p>Please do have a read of the report in full for all the details and context. I don't play Marvel Rivals myself, but I found this one interesting since - while it's somewhat of a well-seasoned nothing burger - it's fundamentally just a group of passionate players wanting to share the excitement of getting new toys to play with. Hell, <em>I'm </em>excited about Paste Pot Pete and I haven't watched a Marvel film since X-Men 2, nor played a videogame in 15 years.</p>
<p>"A server that started small to spread information has now become a cornerstone of information across the entire community, and sometimes we can misinterpret things or make mistakes," Keone told IGN. "We're a group of people working hard to find and share information, and there's never malice behind what we post. We'll work hard to make sure things don't spread like wildfire again unless it's been verified first, and are grateful for everything we've been able to share thus far."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
