Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocols-western-release-has-been-cancelled-and-its-japanese-servers-will-shut-down-early-next-year">last year</a>? And remember how it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">brought back to life only a few months later</a> as Blue Protocol: Star Resonance? It's not often that such a turnaround happens, so you have to count your blessings when they do. And now, almost a year on from that, following a recent beta test, this retitled version of the game has a release date.
</p>
<p>
It's not very far away either, having been scheduled for an October 9th launch. This announcement came with a beta test recap music video, which feels like a first of some kind, and possibly for good reason. The music video features the game's official English theme song, "Starlight Over Asterleeds~星々が輝く場所~," and it's got a strange energy to it, like it came from an anime that was incredibly popular in 2013 due to a perfect set of circumstances, but has had zero longevity because of a severe like of substance. A bit mean perhaps, it's just when your lyrics include the lines "We won't back down!" and "The stars are singing with our soul," you might want to think about a rewrite.

<p>
If you have zero clue about what Blue Protocol is, or just forget after it was initially cancelled, it is an MMORPG in a self-described "anime-styled fantasy world." Taking a look at the gameplay, to be honest it mostly looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> were an MMO. That's fine, that'll be somebody's something! The issue I'm facing is that outside of the game making it very clear you get to make your very own anime hero, it's not very clear what you'll be doing.
</p><p>
Yes, there'll be raids, sure, there'll be social features, but details on the actual world and story are pretty scant. Perhaps that really is secondary to being a fantasy anime character, though to be quite honest, you're pretty spoiled for choice on that front these days. At the very least, I'll be curious to see how it's received, especially in light of its death and rebirth.
