            <p>Yep, that sound you can hear is the pounding footsteps of a certain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> minutefellow. He's coming to tell you that another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> settlement may soon need your help, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">modder</a>'s figured out how to let folks build stuff using the likes of rocks and beams as they play.</p>
<p>It's not quite got all the bells and whistles of a full settlement building system yet, but its creator is hoping to find someone to collab with on putting together exactly that.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right now, MadAborModding's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4648?tab=description">settlement building proof of concept</a> lets you spawn in world objects, adjust where they're placed on the fly, and then save them in place to make permanent additions to the world. It's a bit rudimentary at current, but there are "over 12,000 spawnable objects" at your fingertips, plus the ability to put 'em wherever you like and have them be there whenever you load up the game.</p>
<p>To build, you start by either using your left and right arrow keys to scroll through the spawnable objects in a random order or save time by adding the exact ones you want to one of the mod's LUA files. From there you look at and use the up arrow on the stone wall, beam or rock you're adding in to pick it up. You'll need to put it down once to enable its collision physics, then pick it up again to place it where you want.</p>
<p>V and B move it up and down, while Z, X, and C rotate it. Once you're done, you press backspace to save your placed stuff, with the mod recording these as ini files it'll then load up next time you start the game. These ini files are also able to be copied out of the game files if you want to share a creation with other people and let them load it into their game.</p>
<p>"I hope someone expands this into an actual settlement system," the modder wrote, "My goal with uploading this is hopefully to bait someone into doing that." They added that they're open to working with other interested parties to make that happen, with categorising objects and making menus being the aspects they'd need the most help pulling off.</p>
<p>What makes his so cool is that Oblivion Remastered still lacks official modding tools, with modders left to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-potential-pinnacle-of-elder-scrolls-modding-reckons-pioneer-modder">push boundaries and experiment</a> with the tools they do have. That often means there's more to install on the player's end to account for the processes at play behind-the-scenes being <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">less straightforward</a>, which makes it impressive that all MadAborModding's creation looks to require is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS for OblivionRemastered</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system]]></content:encoded>
