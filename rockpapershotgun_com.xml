            <p>If ever there was a game I didn't expect to spawn a horde of spiritual successors from startup companies of varying dubiety, that game was celebrated commie hangover simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. And yet here we are with yet another claimant to the dance floor, Pera Coda. In fairness, it takes inspiration from a lot more than just ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but Disco Elysium is mentioned rather prominently in the marketing.</p>
<p>Created by Falan, a Turkish team founded by three architecture students, Pera Coda is a timeloop story set in a "surreal", "neon-noir" Istanbul, in which you play an attorney, Deniz, who is navigating a purgatory inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">Bardo in Buddhism</a>. The city is described as "both a stage and a mirror, where East meets West, chaos meets calm, and each district reflects a piece of your fragmented self." Certainly sounds quite Revacholian. Here's a teaser trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Combat there is none: instead, you'll solve point-and-click puzzles and make use of a "masking" mechanic, which lets you resculpt Deniz's memories and alter certain objects in ways that persist across loops. The investor pitchdeck I've been sent compares the puzzling to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/12-minutes">12 Minutes</a>. Another comparison that springs to my mind is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a>. </p>
<p>The Falan devs have posted a few concept videos of the game on social media, ahead of today's announcements. It's seemingly thanks to the popularity of those early videos that they've now partnered up with Elyzio, a company founded in 2022 by former Ubisoft technical director Anas El Ferachi and Google gaming consultant Dogan Can Yeginer. You might know Elyzio as the publishers of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689640/Wardens_Will/">Warden's Will</a>, a movement shooter that earned a few thumbs-up from the Steam reviewerati. </p>
<p>Pera Coda's current development team under Elyzio includes game designer Cem Çelik, previously a junior designer at Crytek, technical director Arthur Trouslard, who has worked across Ubisoft, Sloclap and Don't Nod, and Mehmet Ali Şen, formerly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultic">Cultic</a>, whose past credits include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360390/Cats_and_the_Other_Lives/">Cats And The Other Lives</a>.</p>
<p>Very much speaking as a clueless Anglo European tourist, the thing I find most interesting about Pera Coda is the city, which is "grounded in real iconic buildings and neighbourhoods", but is punctured by hallucinations. I would also like to hear more of the game's interpretation of Bardo, about which I am also clueless. Here are some screens.</p>

<p>If you prefer your Disco Elysulikes to be developed by people who worked (in whatever capacity) on Disco Elysium, may I refer you to the three direct heirs - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-psychogeography-est-of-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-is-a-gonzo-journalism-rpg-named-hopetown">Hopetown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">XXX Nightshift</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">whatever they're making at Summer Eternal</a>. All three were announced within hours of each other, producing what Nic called "an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases".</p>
<p>The rush continues with games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">Esoteric Ebb</a>. There are also a bunch of smaller Disco Elysuals on <a href="https://itch.io/c/5746476/disco-elysium">Itch.io</a>. I realise I'm probably doing some or all of these projects a disservice by framing them as Disco Elysium follow-ups, but it does feel a bit mad. Rumour has it that the pigeon currently trapped in your office is also making a Disco Elysium successor in collaboration with Tencent, based on the five minutes it once spent shitting on a ZA/UM staffer's sandwich. Personally, I'm reserving my pennies for the dawning of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>-like trend.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-has-yet-another-heir-in-pera-coda-a-turkish-timeloop-rpg-set-in-a-dreamlike-version-of-istanbul]]></content:encoded>
