        <p>If an article is posted and there are no commenters, does it make a sound?</p>

            <p>Hark! Comments have been temporarily turned off on Rock Paper Shotgun. We and all of our sibling websites are moving to a new commenting platform and the existing comments need to be ported across. This process will take some time - days, perhaps - and we'll update this post once it's complete and commenting functionality has been restored.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In brief, we need to take a snapshot of the almost 2 million comments posted on RPS over the last seventeen years, then import them into the new system. It's better if new comments aren't being created in that time.
</p>
<p>Once comments return, you shouldn't need to do anything differently. Your login and site account will remain the same as before, but the comment section itself will have a different look and feel and probably a few different features. We'll share more details once the switchover happens.
</p>
<p>If we had been able to plan this further in advance, we would have published a series of articles containing our most controversial opinions, to take advantage of your brief inability to yell at us. But alas, it wasn't to be. Instead I'll say that I truly value the comment community here and I look forward to hearing from you all again on these pages soon. In the meantime, you can make yourself heard by <a href="mailto:graham@rockpapershotgun.com">emailing me</a> with  any thoughts, questions or feedback.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
