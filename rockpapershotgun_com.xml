            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will in fact be compatible with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Ubisoft say, despite a previous <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">tech Q&amp;A</a> on the sneaky-stabby ninja sim declaring point-blank that it won’t. Announced on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687">whatever the fuck Twitter is</a> these days, the confirmation that Shadows will play nice with the Deck comes as a pleasant surprise – even without that prior naysaying, games with a GTX 1070 listed among the minimum specs typically don’t cope too well on the handheld’s frugal hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The only question, suggesteth the tweet, is whether Shadows will get a full-on Verified stamp of approval from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Valve’s compatibility testers</a>, or the Playable classification, which is normally handed to games that run well enough but might have awkward controls or tricky-to-read text. It’ll help, at least, that this particular Assassin’s Creed is launching with a native Steam version, and won’t solely be yoked to Ubisoft Connect (though there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">other ways</a> of installing that launcher on your Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Another barrier that Ubisoft have seemingly both erected and cleared is Shadows’ mandatory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">ray tracing</a>. While not slathered in always-on megalighting like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, it won’t be possible to entirely switch off ray traced effects, as they’ll always be enabled in the player’s hideout hub at minimum. With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-eternals-ray-tracing-now-works-on-the-steam-deck">few exceptions</a>, ray tracing will cut down Steam Deck performance like an impertinent daimyo’s neck, but Ubisoft have also created a more easygoing, software-based version of these effects, which will supposedly function adequately on lower-end GPUs. Which would explain why the GTX 1070 is in the minimum specs and not, say, the RTX 2060, with all its hardware-based ray tracing tools.</p>
<p>Whatever you might play it on, Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches next Thursday, April 20th. Ed (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-my-time-with-assassins-creed-shadows-but-i-remain-unconvinced-by-its-split-protagonists">had a play in January</a>, finding it a competent open-world yarn, though was less impressed with the dual-protagonist gimmick that left hulking samurai Yasuke feeling less fleshed-out than stealthy shinobi Naoe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
