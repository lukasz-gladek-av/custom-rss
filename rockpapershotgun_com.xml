            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has famously endured struggles when it comes to running well on PC since release. Capcom have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">tried relentlessly</a> to improve that situation, with varying results. Cue today, and a Reddit scientist coming to the conclusion that overtly aggressive DLC checks might be a key factor in the game's woes. Another modder has subsequently put out a work to combat the issue with the checks, but they reckon fixing this problem isn't necessarily a cure-all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">original thread</a> looking into these DLC checks was penned by Reddit user de_Tylmarande. Having played around with versions of the game on two Steam accounts - one with all of the Wilds' DLC bought and one running the DLC-less base version - they observed that the former seemed to benefit from better FPS numbers. Reaching the hypothesis that the discrepancies in frame rate they report experiencing in the two versions might be down to the DLC-less version of the game being throttled by regular behind-the-scenes checks as to which DLC was active, they did some testing.</p>
<p>"I quickly made a small 'mod' that made the game think I have all DLC present...And yes - performance went through the roof. Yes, without any CPU boost, in Balance mode. On any settings. The game literally flies," they wrote, emphasising that the mod was simply one that convinced the game they had all of the DLC installed, rather than actually giving them it. So, they said they've reached out to Capcom's support with their findings, suggesting "it's just a bug in the code they need to fix" rather than any maliciou bit of design.</p>
<p>Cool. Naturally, this being modders, one of their brethren has already looked into the situation and put out a work which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">limits Wilds' DLC checks</a> on Nexus Mods (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mchsumduun24">spotted</a> by friend of the Treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/dominic-tarason">Dominic Tarason</a>). According to this second modder, Vaeux, the DLC checks do seem to have some impact on performance, but only in certain areas of the game:</p>
<blockquote><p>As discovered by de_Tylmarande, who documented it in a Reddit thread, depending on which DLCs you own, Monster Hunter Wilds may perform dozens of checks for DLC ownership every frame. This can easily add up to thousands of (relatively) computationally-expensive checks every second, significantly reducing your framerate if it's bottlenecked by your CPU.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like this only happens when you're close enough to a Support Desk Felyne (the ones that handle bounties and have a DLC menu) to see an exclamation point on its map/world icon, which pops up if you purchase DLC, so you know to go and redeem your new DLC. So, it only matters while you're standing in/near a Base Camp. Not quite as game-changing as some were hoping, but better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether Capcom, having seen all of this experimentation, end up being able to nail down any extra fixes/improvements to Wilds beyond what they've already done or <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">have planned</a>.</p>

            <p>I only have to skate a few meters before the piercing drum of rifle fire fills my ears. Armed with my trusty can of spray paint, I cover the hostile soldiers in splotches of bright colour while rollerblading circles around them. They stumble about, trying to keep me in their sights. Stopping to complete an unfinished bit of graffiti on one of the walls, spreading colour between gaps in a template, the soldiers gather around me. Unable to target me, they mill about in the way as I try to finish, making it a touch more difficult to work out if I've left any blank spaces.</p>
<p>I'm playing an early version of Palestine Skating Game, which offers a test of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-inspired rollerblading and painting amid a stylised rendition of war-torn Gaza.</p>

<p>Palestine Skating Game has been in the works for a number of years, but it came to my attention via Amaar Chowdhury's recent interview with its developers for <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/article/palestine-skating-game-rollerskating-resistance-video-development-graffiti">Huck</a>. Rather than summarise the excellent article, which I recommend reading in full, I'll focus on my impressions of the game's 0.8 demo.</p><p>After finishing the mural while watched by the paint-covered guards, I spent some time railgrinding through this early demo's version of the West Bank separation wall. The space is a recreation of a few city blocks, filled with real world artworks and murals emblazoned across the looming concrete facade. You pass drawings of <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/sets/hdYTtJwekUCU6HVVKREssg/political-graffiti-takes-over-the-west-bank-wall">Trump and Netenyahu kissing</a>, Morgan Freeman's face alongside a quote from Nelson Mandela, murals dedicated to both <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/israeli-court-acquits-officer-of-killing-autistic-palestinian-man">Eyad al-Hallaq</a> and <a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/leila-khaled-the-poster-girl-of-palestinian-militancy-international-womans-day/">Leila Khaled</a>.</p>
<p>The reality of the environment grounds the otherwise loveably janky splattering of paint globs. The experience feels deeply unnerving, but I'm glad of that discomfort. Playing left me  aware of the real suffering the game's aiming to convey through the backdrop to its carefree sliding around. After respraying a massive tank as it fired booming shells my way, I returned to the wall. The structure makes me think how this wall, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/7/8/in-pictures-israels-illegal-separation-wall-still-divides">declared illegal many years ago by the International Court of Justice</a> impacts the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/droi/dv/905_impact_/905_impact_en.pdf">Palestinans living in its shadow</a>.</p>
<p>In its final form, the developers plan to include an electronic score, but currently Palestine Skating Game has no soundtrack. A cold silence is punctuated only by the discharging of weapons. I'd argue this makes those sounds hit harder than they might in the final version. For now, it remains a work-in-progress blend of video game silliness and brutal reality, made by a team who know that day-to-day of that brutality firsthand, some still living in the West Bank to this day.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the most recent prototype of Palestine Skating Game a go, you can find it on <a href="https://palestineskatinggame.itch.io/prototype3">Itch.io</a>. The game's developers have <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/palestine-skating-game-fundraiser">GoFundMe</a> and <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/palestine_skating_game__grind_shoot_paint__do_graffiti_to_arabic_electronic_music">LaunchGood</a> open to raise money for their Gazan staff, though the latter looks like it may be closed for donations as of writing.</p>
