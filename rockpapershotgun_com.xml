I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before.
</p>

<p>
You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you.

I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go.
</p>
<p>
Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in.
</p>
<p>
Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081690/Chromatic_Conundrum/">right here</a>.

There are two shooters that I imagine will never die, because they just seem to hang on despite being incredibly old and plenty of other games coming out in the mean-time: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> (both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> games, funnily enough - they've clearly got the Source (sorry)). <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which came out back in 2023, is the most played shooter of all time on Steam in fact, but even now the original game is still pretty popular. There's literally more than 16,000 people playing it right now. And though it might not be official, a group of modders have come together to remake the 1.6 version of the game.
</p>

<p>
Titled CS: Legacy, the team behind it want you to know that this isn't just a fancy mod of the classic shooter, but a "from the ground up" remaking made with completely custom code and original assets. It should still have that same Valve feel to it, though, as the entire thing is being made in the developer's official 2013 Source Engine SDK, albeit with some tinkering with its renderer, shaders, and a few other systems.

According to the trailer (which you can have a gander at above), it'll be coming to Steam in early access some time this year. It being a standalone thing certainly might suggest that it has the all-clear from Valve, which wouldn't be that surprising given how chill the studio is with this kind of thing - I'll remind you of that OG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> that came outâ€¦ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-is-fully-launched-for-real">half a decade ago apparently</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a shooty person, nor have I ever even played Counter-Strike, but I do love a good fan project like this, and judging from the comments on the trailer, fans of the original shooter seem pretty pumped about this one.
