Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.

<p>
Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A few months on from releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">Greedfall 2: The Dying World</a> has received its first major update, and it certainly seems like a fairly big one. First up, there's a whole new region to explore called "Olima, City of Stars", and I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that it has nothing to do with that guy from Pikmin. Its name actually comes from the fact there's a big ole observatory to be found there, though what that entails, you'll have to find out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's also a new companion arriving with this update, Safia, an "anti-imperialistâ€¦ seasoned explorer". Not played any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> myself, but I'm always down for taking down empires. Rifles seem to be her whole shtick, assisting you in battle with them, and there's an implication that you can learn how to use them yourself from her.

<p>
This update also comes with a place called the Hub, located on your own ship ("not a boat" developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/spiders">Spiders</a> makes sure to point out, for some reason), once you've acquired one anyway. While on the Hub you can get ready for your next journey, have a natter with companions, and there's also plans to allow you to buy materials from merchants, view romance scenes (wink wink), and more further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Combat has supposedly seen some improvements now too, in a few different ways overall it's looking smoother, faster, and a bit cleaner too. Spiders offered a more detailed look at how combat has changed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1997660/announcements/detail/543352686106378873?snr=1_5_9_">earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that there's a new disguise system, more regional quests, newly introduced companion quests, a higher level cap, a respec consumable, refreshed UI, and just a whole bunch of bug fixes. Happy Greedfalling!
