            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hasn't sold as well as publishers Paradox predicted. As such, the company have announced plans to write-down 355 million Swedish Krona (approximately £28 million/$37 million) of the game's development costs - essentially the financial way of saying something along the lines of 'oops, this isn't worth as much as we thought it was'.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">notice</a> announcing this write-down Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said the game's a "strong vampire fantasy" and that Paradox are pleased with the work that's gone into it from developers The Chinese Room. As such, the finger of blame's being pointed at Paradox themselves for having overtly high expectations regarding how well Bloodlines 2 would do financially.</p>
<p>"A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down," Wester said. "The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales."</p>
<p>Here are the bits which are relevant to those of us who aren't here to look at Paradox's money numbers. In light of this, Wester said the publisher will "evaluate how we best develop" World of Darkness games going forwards, but stressed that Bloodlines 2 will still be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-latest-patch-offers-up-fixes-as-a-roadmap-promises-more-improvements">the additions</a> which have already been set in stone for it. "Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year," Wester confirmed. So, if you bought the premium edition, you'll still get the two expansions you paid for.</p><p>Paradox's admission here follows departed Chinese Room co-founder Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-should-have-been-called-something-else-agrees-former-creative-director">recently revealing</a> that the studio started trying to convince the publishers to call the game something other than Bloodlines 2 was a priority for him almost as soon as he became involved in the project, which bumped from studio to studio during development. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>," Pinchbeck recalled.</p>
<p>The name didn't change, leaving Bloodlines 2 as a game that in the eyes of many is defined as much by what it isn't as what it is. "The overall problem here is that in a year packed with absolutely amazing games of all shapes and sizes, Bloodlines 2 is merely okay," wrote Dominic Tarason in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>. "An entertaining mid-budget way to pass a few evenings in a familiar setting."</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails naval expansion had its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">release pushed back</a> from June 17th to November 26th. You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marauding-medieval-masses-mash-together-beneath-the-mainsail-in-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails">give it a go</a> right now if you fancy, so it obviously made that second date. Prior to the DLC dropping, I chatted with Bannerlord senior producer Falk Engel about what went into the decision to ditch the initial summer date, and why custom naval battles were <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">only confirmed</a> to be arriving with its launch quite late in the day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked whether the delay was down to specific issues which needed to be overcome, or just a general desire to spend more time polishing the massive overhaul up, Engel told me it was a "bit of both". There's always this technical challenge to optimise it as much as possible," he said. "Especially as you add more content and features, because everything that you add can also break stuff that you thought was already done with.</p>
<p>"Then on the other hand, there was a conscious conversation, conscious discussion that the title was not yet at the level of quality and the amount of content and features that we wanted. So, it was just the sensible choice for us to take additional time and that time as well allowed us to push out the base game changes for player feedback and react to that player feedback."</p>
<p>So, Taleworlds spent time refining War Sails and patch v1.3.4, as well as answering questions from players in regular developer blog posts to keep interest in the DLC boiling away. In the <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">fourth of these posts</a>, the team answered a question about whether War Sails would include custom naval battles - standalone fights players can set up to their liking from the main menu in the base game - at launch. Surprise: the post revealed, following previous feedback, that those custom ship battles would be coming at launch.</p><p>When I asked Engel what went into the original decision not to have these custom naval battles right away, and how those plans changed, he conceded that it's a "bit more of a technical question", so he'd need to go out on a limb. "The way that I understand it, our custom battle is a separate module from sandbox, from campaign, etc," he explained. "With the way that we've set up our base game, it can function like that. The way that the DLC is set up, the ships and so forth are set up, it’s more complex to access the relevant elements of the game. One of the things that I believe we still don't have in naval custom battles, for example, are the [ship] figureheads. That is because of this sort of modular or module approach to different elements of the game."</p>
<p>He added that, natually, this modular approach is a boon for modding, revealing that "essentially, War Sails is a large mod". While he didn't get into specifics, Engel did add that developing War Sails has "resulted in changes to the way that modding is supported", which have had a "positive impact" overall.</p>
<p>As someone who's always a bit more comfortable watching an assault I know won't leave me having to lick my wounds and start rebuilding my army from scratch after a few painful nights in chains, I'm certainly glad Taleworlds were able to make custom battles work from the get-go. Plus, they're an ideal way of trying the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-designer-on-ships-that-mimic-horse-archers-and-dredging-for-inspiration-in-french-bogs">fleet of historically-inspired vessels</a> before you commit to investing the considerable coin to buy one in a full campaign.</p>
