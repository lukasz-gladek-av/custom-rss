Look, I'm sorry, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> has the best hook of any game ever. As the headline notes, this is a game where music is illegal, and you do crimes. It's a rhythm game, no less, which it couldn't really be anything else but that, right? I've been waiting for it for about four years now, since the Kickstarter launched, and unfortunately it's still not quite ready yet. However! As of today, the next best thing is here: a demo.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"A demo? Doesn't Unbeatable already have one of those?" I hear you ask. Yes, it's had a couple in fact, but this one's a proper one, the kind that actually lets you play a vertical slice of the game so you can really get a feel for it. Earlier demos were mostly about trying out the game's rhythm mechanics, whereas this one, which was paired with yet another incredibly sharp new trailer, lets you roam around a bit. There is some rhythm gaming to be done of course, just not only to songs.

<p>
There's a couple places in the demo where you can just jam out to the sound of the beat of the world, making improvised songs to the beat of a vending machine, or the sound of seagulls. You'll also make and hang-up posters to plaster across police recruitment flyers, and, oh, you do fight cops too, because they suck (and again, music is illegal, you do crimes, etc.). There's a baseball minigame for heaven's sake! I'm not sure if I need to explain much more how compelling this demo is.
</p>
<p>
But I will anyway, because the cherry on top is that there's a Y2K as hell arcade mode now too, completely focused on the rhythm game side of it all, which I'm infinitely obsessed with already. Who knew games could look this good!
</p>
<p>
It's a really comprehensive demo that, if I weren't already positioning this as my future game of the year, would absolutely convince me to pick it up at launch. No go, be away with you, commit a felony to some sick tunes, that's an order, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> to make things easier for you.

Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> outlined their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-2025-roadmap-outlines-upcoming-seasons-tweaks-and-ugh-collabs">plans</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> across 2025 that, notably, teased the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game would be getting a few collabs. They didn't mention what said collabs would be, just that they exist, to which I said "ugh", because, well, ugh, why does everything have to have collabs these days? The annoying thing is that Blizzard kind of nailed it with the first one, which just so happens to be with the iconic dark fantasy series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yes, the same Berserk that is essentially half the reason we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, why Cloud has his giant buster sword, and why the dark knight role exists in Final Fantasy as a whole. The official Diablo Twitter (or Ex, or whatever) shared an animated teaser showing a very bald and bearded man wearing Berserk protagonist Guts' armour, swinging around his iconic sword too, but it didn't show off all that much more than that. My guess is that it'll be a cosmetic you can unlock at the very least, but perhaps there'll be some gameplay ramifications too.

<p>
I'll still never be sold on collabs like these in games, they just feel like a cheap way to get people excited about Brand or Intellectual Property in a way that feels disingenuous. At the very least, Blizzard wasn't lying when they said that the collabs will feature "universes that complement its dark themes."
</p>
<p>
There's also no word on when the collab might be arriving in game, but it should be coming by July, as it's a part of the game's upcoming eighth season, Belial's Return. That kicks off April 29th, so you've got plenty of time to watch the beautiful original anime (and subsequently fulfill your destiny of complaining that the only animated follow-up it got were mediocre 3D efforts), and not so much time to read the original manga. Still worth a shot, I suppose.
