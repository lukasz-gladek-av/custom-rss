            <p>Sony have shut down Firewalk Studios, the developers behind ill-fated multiplayer hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, and confirmed that the game will not be returning to stores. In doing so, they are effectively striking a line through a big, red $200 million in their books - a number that some report is only part of the loss. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Certain] aspects of Concord were exceptional," said Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony's Studio Business Group in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">a press release</a> yesterday, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p>
<p>"After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."</p>
<p>In another example of a businessman using "sunset" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">poetically obfuscate</a> a painful closure (when you open a studio, you do not "dawn" it), Hulst suggests that the shooter scene is crowded and it was difficult for the game to draw a crowd. </p>
<p>"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving," he said, "and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title."</p>
<p>That's putting it lightly. Concord launched to little fanfare and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">taken offline just three weeks afterwards</a> - a painfully quick hobbling by Sony. The game was removed from storefronts and players who paid for the game at launch were offered refunds. Back in 2023, our Katharine (RPS in peace) wrote about all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">the doomed multiplayer shooters</a> lining up at the PlayStation showcase. She predicted that most would not survive six months. Concord did not even make it one. </p>
<p>"We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area," said Hulst.</p>
<p>"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing [Sony Interactive Entertainment]."</p>
<p>The game saw an initial investment of $200 million, according to sources who <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">spoke to Kotaku</a>. But that outlet also notes that this figure doesn't cover the entirety of development, or the cost of Sony buying the studio along with the rights to Concord as a piece of intellectual property. Just how much Sony lost on this game, they're unlikely to state plainly. </p>
<p>Alongside the closure of Firewalk, another studio has been given a bullet in the back of head at sunset. Neon Koi, a studio who have been working on an action game for mobile phones, was also closed. </p>
<p>"Both decisions were given serious thought," said Hulst, "and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PUBG Corporation and Krafton have just gone and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-arc">Project Arc</a>, a top-down 5v5 shooter "inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>". To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As mentioned above, the attacking team's aim is to hack into a "hidden Crypt" on a map, all of which seem to be small buildings promoting close-quarters fights. To get to the crypt, they're to use grenade launchers and "explosive hammers" to break through walls or get the jump on baddies. Meanwhile, the defenders can barricade walls, chuck gas grenades, or pop mobile cover to counteract the raid.</p>

<p>Success seems to rely on getting sightlines on your enemies, or robbing them of theirs. That seems to be achieved through, say, chucking a stun grenade to suddenly reduce an enemy's cone of vision drastically. Or maybe, extending you and your allies' vision cones by lighting up a segment of the map over in the distance. It's a neat idea and one that could make for some Hotline Miami-esque duels between players in confined spots.</p><p>Weirdly, it reminds me a bit of League Of Legends. In the sense that a lot of League's map is permanently fog-of-warred, so good players and teams gain vision control by placing Wards (these light up the fog-of-war) in clever spots. A lot of fights (and matches) can be won or lost based on these Wards and who's spotted who first. I'd imagine the same philosophy rings true in Project Arc.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Project Arc but you can follow its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-3">Wasteland 3</a>, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-very-nearly-like-stasis-bone-totem-this-is-a-recommendation">very nearly liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stasis-bone-totem">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beautiful-desolation">Beautiful Desolation</a> - an isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-use-protocol">Animal Use Protocol</a>, they both featured considerably less monke.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/">Steam page</a> describes it as a “first-person, narrative-focused survival horror” (you’ve got a bad thing chasing you, one of those), but I also would have accepted “Grimdark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>”, which sound facetious but is actually one heck of a sell. Your very smart monke, Penn, is escaping from a lab with a bunch of other test animals, including a little rat mate named Trip who lives on your gravity gun and does a little jump whenever you fire it.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off a similar sort of grimy, unnerving tech to Brotherhood’s previous games. This is good. It also does that horror game trailer thing where it has a bunch of kids singing the Barney The Dinosaur theme really slowly. This is bad and stupid. It’s got a massive tortoise in it. It also contains potassium benzoate etc. Most bad-ly of all, it’s not actually out until 2026. So why am I writing about it now?!</p>
<p><em>Monke.</em></p>
<p>Or Chimp, I suppose, although if you were about to type a comment along those lines, I would first suggest you make sure you know your phylum and genus from your ligma. Feel free to ask about that last one. Here are some more deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 3D first-person, narrative-focused survival horror game, you play as Penn, a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility, where every corner hides new terror. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulation tool, and accompanied by your scrappy rat companion Trip, you’ll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station, relentlessly stalked by a monstrous chimera of experiments gone wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is, by the looks of it, also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">no arachnophobia toggle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
