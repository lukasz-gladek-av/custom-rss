<p>I’ve been trying the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirreled-away">Squirreled Away</a>, and for some reason it keeps wanting me to play it as some kinda 2024-as-heck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game. At this, I make several rapid sniffing-like movements, then scarper adeptly yet dismissively up the nearest tree. It’s just far more fun to treat this as a casual squirrel sim, or, at the very least, a platformer where you occasionally need to steal some strawberries.</p>

<p>Look, I’ve played enough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to appreciate the pleasures of hewing a home together from Mother Gaia’s offcuts. But Squirreled Away’s scavenging and building don’t really do anything to explore beyond familiar stick-to-plank-to-hut tropes, even with the briefly amusing sight of your fluffy protagonist lugging a tiny rock axe on his back. It’s not like you’re crafting to survive anything, either: there are no elements to endure and the only consequence of letting your stamina run out is an inability to swing your tools. No enemies to be scared of either, unless you’re that American cop who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZPplp7wGso">magdumped an acorn</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend using what the demo gives you for gathering purposes – a roamable forest, freeform climbing abilities, zero fall damage – to engage in a spot of chilled-out tree rat parkour. Now <em>this</em> is a good time. There’s a perfectly judged stickiness to how you latch on to bark and branches, and many of the latter look like they were placed specifically for daring cross-canopy leaps. Screenshots for the full game present the tantalising possibility of eventually gaining a dinky hang glider, which might be the one thing in all of existence that could get me back to crafting. You will believe a squirrel can fly.</p>
<p>Down on the ground, the capacity for hijinks is diminished, though I did a smile at my expectedly terrible attempts to strum a guitar, and at how readily I could destroy camping equipment in pursuit of rare golden nuts. Squirreled Away definitely leans further towards cosiness than chaos – it’s not exactly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With a Gun</a>, with or without the gun – but it also has a mischievous side that’s at least passingly fun to explore. When, again, you’re not filling a recipe checklist of twigs and pebbles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Well crack my knuckles and call me Roger, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> has only gone and announced another character to be released as DLC in early April. What's that? You <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-character-will-be-revealed-this-week-and-clues-point-to-a-certain-lady-in-red">already suspected Anna Williams would be added</a> to the 3D fighting game soon? Well, if you're so smart, why did <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> swordsman Clive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-fighter-is-clive-actually">beat her to the punch</a>, huh? Sit down, be quiet, and eat your trailer. I write the news articles here. </p>

<p>As you can see, the lady in red has returned. The snarky sister will be released April 3rd (or March 31st for those who buy the whole season pass in advance). She's the first character of the fighting game's season 2 DLC, with another three biff-buddies to follow - one in summer, another in autumn, and the final fisticuffer in winter. Two new stages are also due to be added in this DLC. </p>
<p>Anna is a long-running Tekken fighter characterised by a love for bazookas and a hatred of her sister and fellow Iron Fist contender Nina. She likes espresso, red wine, and the mouse Jerry from Tom And Jerry cartoons. I'm not making this up for a gag. It is what the <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Williams">always-entertaining Tekken wiki</a> says about her. I don't play as this character, or her sister Nina, so I'm not fully clued in about her high-heel headstomps and gut-blasting gunshots, or her various somersaults and scissorkicks, but the trailer shows a lot of familiar-looking launchers, feints, and open-handed chops. I like her new hairdo.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been out for a year now, and Bandai Namco are boasting that they've sold three million copies. That's three million people who want to beat you up - you must have really annoyed them. I thought this instalment was pretty good when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">battered my opponents and never ever lost in our review</a>. Although I was disappointed none of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> characters were available at launch. One year on we still haven't seen signs of bull-fighting Spanish reprobate Miguel or tearful shin-cracker Josie. I'm not confident the latter will return, but I hold onto hope for my other favourite, Lei Wulong. In Tekken 7 the kung fu cop was released relatively early as DLC goes. I'd love to see him this year too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
