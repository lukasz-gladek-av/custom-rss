            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!

<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.
