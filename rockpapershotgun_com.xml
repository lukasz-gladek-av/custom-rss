If you handed me a deck of revolting Tarot cards and told me to heal a bunch of sickly, deranged medieval peasants, I would probably attempt to sew the cards together into bandages. Perhaps I would offer the nicer ones to children instead of lollipops, to distract them while I apply the leeches (lollipops <em>did</em> exist in the Middle Ages, I'm shocked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop#History">discover</a>, but mostly in noble circles). Bloodletter has grander ambitions. 
</p>
<p>
In this whispery, crazy-eyed deckbuilder, you'll play Tarot-style cards to purge foul spirits who are seeking to possess and kill your neighbours. "Evil entities have crept into the hearts of the common folk, who teeter upon the brink of madness and death," the developers explain. "Only thy bathhouse stands as a bastion against the creeping corruption." It sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-book">Black Book</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>. Here be'est the trailer.

In Bloodletter you play a "barber-surgeon". As stipulated, you operate out of a bathhouse, making you a barber-surgeon...pool attendant? A barber-surgeon-masseuse? And that's before we get to "bloodletter", which very much sounds like it should be a distinct vocation. I write all this in almost total ignorance of how medieval society defined and distinguished caring roles. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, everything you do is handled via the medium of cards. There are over 80, with gloriously manky art, plus six especially powerful blessing and curse cards. You will use them to safeguard ten villagers "with their own talents, oddities, and eerie animations" from four "dreadful entities". One of the demons lives in a statue and invades people's dreams. I'm trying to work out which Tarot cards I'd prescribe for that. Perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_of_Swords">Nine of Swords</a> followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_(tarot_card)">Strength</a>?
</p>
<p>
I think this could be either a miasmatic delight, or an exercise in gradual disappointment as you realise that there are more familiar card game mechanics and synergies lurking beneath the grotty woodcut illustrations. It'll be a while before we know for sure - the game launches in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3493400/BLOODLETTER/">Read more on Steam.</a> If you need to get your ghastly cardgame fix sooner, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-devours-demo-harbours-the-seeds-of-a-brilliant-horror-card-rpga">the demo for Roots Devour</a>.

            <p>An alleged cryptocurrency scam that models itself on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be launching on Steam this week, despite Valve's promises that they do not allow NFT or blockchain games to exist on the platform. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-xrpl">Paradise</a> has been advertised as an action game set in a sunny city which will allow players to drive cars, shoot enemies, and earn money. But its in-game currency is based on blockchain technology, and some reports allege it is a scam based in Russia which does not allow its crypto investors to withdraw funds. When asked why the game is allowed on the platform, Valve have repeatedly neglected to comment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Paradise will be releasing into early access on April 2, say developers Ultra Games. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_c9D63YNm4">recent trailer</a> shows a player inspecting guns, walking through a garage full of cars, and navigating a world split up with loading screens made with AI-generated art designed to look like the loading screens of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Previous trailers boast that you can speak to any NPC using AI technology. </p>
<p>"Play with your friends, engage in shootouts, race cars, complete daily missions, and reach the apex of life," reads a blurb. "Earn money and buy what you want, from real estate to fancy clothes." The creators have boasted that the game is in Steam's top 200 most wishlisted games. It's possible many of those Steam users aren't aware of the game's grubby features and history of misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Paradise uses a currency called the $PAR token which is based on blockchain technology, and can be invested in via a third-party app. Some investors in this cryptocoin claim they became unable to withdraw funds, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-copycat-paradise-is-an-alleged-crypto-scam-yet-continues-to-gain-steam-wishlists">we reported in January</a>. The developers have also falsely claimed to be working with streamers such as Ninja and Pokimane, and included unlicensed use of a Lamborghini and other cars in previous trailers. </p>

<p>Together with a lot of AI slop and very heavy use of Unreal Marketplace assets, the game had enough red flags that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">multiple YouTubers investigated the company</a> behind it, with one discovering that the Hong Kong address listed by the company was fake and eventually discovering that it is actually based somewhere in Tbilisi, Georgia - a city with <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/project/scam-empire/diamonds-dior-and-dubai-vacations-the-luxurious-lives-of-georgias-call-center-scammers">a troubled history when it comes to blockchain scammers</a>. </p>
<p>"Versions of the game for Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation Store will not include cryptocurrency, ensuring there are no restrictions for users on these platforms," say the developers in a <a href="https://paradisevs.com/company_statement2">defensive rebuttal</a> on their website. Unfortunately, no one can verify the developer's claims until the game is released. But even if a means to buy the currency is not present in the final release, it wouldn't restrict the game from redirecting players to the third-party cryptocurrency app necessary for players to earn and spend the game's $PAR token in-game. An act which, in itself, could be harmful to users, even if Valve’s terms of service don’t specifically forbid this. Since the game can still serve as a Trojan horse for hooking people into an alleged crypto scam.</p>
<p>On top of this, the document which insists cryptocurrency will not be in the game is full of other misleading statements, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4RvTrS-nE">pointed out by video creator Jetro</a>, one of the YouTubers who previously investigated the game. The developers claim their use of a minimap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> is allowed, for example, because "The GTA 5 map is based on the real layout of Los Angeles, which is not intellectual property". To avoid doubt: the GTA 5 map is not a 1:1 reproduction of Los Angeles, and Rockstar own the rights to that map. </p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-is-banning-games-with-nfts-and-cryptocurrency">banned all games that feature NFT and cryptocurrency</a> in 2021. The Paradise developers have edited the game's Steam page a number of times since it first appeared, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3281420/history/?changeid=U:56561021">removing trailers that mention cryptocurrency</a>, for example. It's unclear if Valve have been in contact with the developers or not. I have asked Valve for comment on this game multiple times and have not received a response. </p>
<p>The game is also launching <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-9e47b6">on the Epic Store</a>, but only after it was removed once and reuploaded as "Paradise XRPL" , with a store page that clearly states it is an NFT game, along with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-faq-9f3b93">an FAQ on its crypto gubbins</a> which insists that it is good for the game. "The introduction of a crypto token in PARADISE XRPL enhances the product by enabling streamlined transactions for in-game purchases, facilitating trade between players, and granting access to exclusive content." I have also asked Epic Games for comment and will let you know if we learn more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
