<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> developers Saber Interactive are pushing back on player calls to add an even-harder difficulty mode, following the introduction of an Absolute difficulty setting this spring via game update.</p>
<p>Apparently, some of you muscleheads have been finding Absolute "a bit easy", or at least, not enough of a shake-up from the preceding Lethal difficulty. Saber are open to suggestions, here, but game director Dmitriy Grigorenko also reckons that "we are almost at our limit in terms of how we can make the game harder without making it unfair and not fun". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Posting in <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update">a community note</a> on publisher Focus Entertainment's website,  Grigorenko described Saber as "quite happy with how intense" Absolute is, on the whole. "We see that it requires a lot of concentration and we feel like it's fun in terms of how many enemies you have to face, how hard they hit you etc," he wrote. "At the same time, we see some comments that it's a bit easy. Yet on the other hand we don't want to mess it up and would like to hear the voice of the community first."
</p>
<p>
He's got some "data and context" to justify his fears about messing things up. Argh, context! It burns, it burns, etc. Briefly, the average win rate on Absolute difficulty is around 60%, which is "a bit higher than we expected" and around 10% higher than the average for Lethal difficulty. This can be explained, however, by the fact that Absolute difficulty has to be unlocked, so all the people smashing their faces against it are pretty seasoned. Also, only around 12% of average daily play time has been spent in Absolute, and only around 15% of weekly active players play at least a single match on Absolute difficulty. 
</p>
<p>
In short, "only a small portion of very hardcore and well-prepared players are playing the Absolute difficulty", so it doesn't make sense to devote overmuch resources to pumping up the challenge even further. Besides which, Grigorenko doesn't think there's much to be gained in general from making Space Marine 2 even more of a meat-grinder.
</p>
<p>
"I will be completely honest," Grigorenko continued. "I think we are almost at our limit in terms of how we can make the game harder without making it unfair and not fun. We can't significantly increase the number of enemies for performance and memory reasons. Greatly increasing enemy damage and hp will make it so players will die randomly and will make enemies bullet sponges, which will not be fun.
</p>
<p>
"We do not want to implement a new difficulty, because that would split the matchmaking pool even more. We have to stick to the existing 6 difficulties." 
</p>
<p>
Saber are, however, looking to introduce a new set of modifiers, similar to the controversial Tight Formation multiplayer mechanic, which punished players for straying apart in Lethal difficulty, and was removed a week after its introduction.</p>
<p>Grigorenko hopes that the "combination of [these modifiers] would make each challenge unique", and is happy "to announce that we are already working on the system, however this will take some time." Beyond that, he's set up some reader polls for possible smaller tweaks to Absolute, such as limiting ammo and adding more Terminus enemies.
</p>
<p>
I haven't really played Space Marine 2 since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">rambling about Warhammer 40,000's fascist sensibilities</a> last year, but I wonder to what extent Saber's difficulties with game difficulty are exacerbated by the Space Marine mentality of securing a righteous death against unwinnable odds. There is no act of martyrdom Absolute enough for these lads.

            <p>Lubricate your brain with some pure Omega-3 oils, a new puzzle game from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/opus-magnum">Opus Magnum</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eliza">Eliza</a> has been announced. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kaizen-a-factory-story">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a> will be an "open-ended puzzle automation game from the original Zachtronics team, set in 1980s Japan" in which you'll build toy robots, computers, TVs, and... katsu curry? Well, why not. Although the studio behind this engineer 'em up is technically new, the main designers - Zach Barth and Matthew Seiji Burns - are the same folks who brought you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exapunks">Exapunks</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tis-100">TIS-100</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenzhen-io">Shenzhen I/O</a>. This, my friends, is very good news. </p>

<p>"It's not a Zachtronics game," Barth told PC Gamer in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/one-of-the-best-puzzle-game-designers-is-back-with-kaizen-a-factory-story-a-game-about-manufacturing-japanese-consumer-goods-during-the-largest-economic-bubble-in-history/">an interview</a> following the game's announcment. "This is a Coincidence game, which is a totally legally distinct game studio."</p>
<p>Coincidence have already released one game - Add Astra, an educational puzzler about math and racing. But this looks like a more intentional successor to the automation crown. All the hallmarks of the designers' previous programmy puzzlers seem to be intact. You play as a fish out of water (in this case a Japanese-American who finds himself working in a factory on the outskirts of Tokyo), you'll tinker with machinery to come up with efficient (or comically inefficient) solutions, and you'll export GIFs of your assembly lines with all the pride of an Instagram mum showing off little Gregory's latest crayon spew. It has solitaire, but the solitaire is also pachinko. It's called "Pachi-Sol".</p>

<p>It does have one new interesting feature, though. You'll be able to scrub back through your building process in a rewind-ish way, and edit it from whatever specific point you royally messed up. Which sounds like it'll be handy on bigger projects. </p>
<p>Many writers at RPS have been fans of these games over the years. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/premature-evaluation-shenzhen-io">swooned</a> over Shenzhen I/O, which saw you emigrating to China to make circuit boards. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eliza-review">lost sleep</a> (in a good way) while playing thoughtful visual novel Eliza. And when alchemy dabbler Opus Magnum released it left Matt, Graham and myself competing to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-machina-our-proudest-opus-magnum-machines">magnificent machinery</a> (sadly, the powerful GIFs in this article no longer work). "I really like making my dumb little games that don't matter," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/opus-magnum-interview-zach-barth">said Zach Barth</a> following that game's release. Games that <em>don't matter?</em> Excuse me, Opus Magnum remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle games</a> to this day. </p>
<p>A few years later Zachtronics would close, but not before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retro-styled-puzzle-compilation-last-call-bbs-is-the-final-zachtronics-game">releasing its final game</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-call-bbs">Last Call BBS</a>. It looks like that swan song was actually just a big white duck quacking musically, now that Barth and Burns have returned with Coincidence.</p>
<p>We've been in the habit of calling these puzzle games "Zachlikes" ever since Alice O'Connor (RPS in peace) coined the term, although Barth, after whom the genre is named, wishes it were different. "I hate saying Zach-like," he told PC Gamer. "If anybody has any suggestions for a different thing we can call them?" Hmmm... I don't know. On the one hand, you did release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zachtronics-book-on-game-design-crowdfunding-on-kickstarter">a whole book with Zach-like as the title</a>, somewhat sealing the term with approval. Then again, it's true we often caution against auteurism in the RPS treehouse. What to do, what to do. </p>
<p>Let's put these thoughts off until Kaizen: A Factory Story comes out. A release date hasn't been announced yet. I'll set up some elaborate electrical alarms to go off when we know more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
