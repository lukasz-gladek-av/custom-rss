            <p>Capcom have a tough fight on their hands at the moment. No, Arkveld hasn't escaped from its lair to terrorise the non-OP masses. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been suffering from some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">pretty nasty performance issues</a> on PC.</p>
<p>While they don't look to have the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> running as well as some kind of crash and stuffer-free Usain Bolt quite yet, the release of Wilds' second title update has seen the studio try to curb some shader compilation and VRAM-related problems.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside deploying the update, which brings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-second-title-update-is-adding-in-lagiacrus-from-monster-hunter-3-when-it-arrives-next-week">Lagiacrus and a bunch of other new stuff</a> to the game (including Fender guitars, because why not), Capcom have put out a fix aimed at stopping shader compilation while you're playing from causing "high CPU load and unstable performance".</p>
<p>Now, instead of shaders being complied once you're hunning the mons, that process'll take place at launch when there's a fresh update to apply, and you won't need to worry about trying to delete your shader cache files in order to improve the situation.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Steam hunters!</p><p>With Title Update 2's arrival, we have resolved a previous issue where shader compilation during gameplay caused high CPU load and unstable performance. </p><p>Please be aware of the following when booting up the game after installing the latest update:</p><p>⚪ Shader… <a href="https://t.co/PzXQK3NGvV">pic.twitter.com/PzXQK3NGvV</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1939617276677759340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>That's not the only thing the devs have done, with title update two's <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html">full patch notes</a> revealing some other Steam-specific tweaks designed to help reverse the game's recent review fortunes in the Valve money place.</p>
<p>First of all, you'll now have a warning pop up if you try to launch the Wilds with out of date GPU drivers, an unsupported OS, or while using compatibility mode. There's also some extra support for Nvidia and AMD upscaling and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>The big fixes in the notes, though, concern VRAM. Capcom have tweaked how much of it's used when the game's streaming textures, fixed the VRAM usage estimate in the game's settings not being accurate, and rectified that last one also affecting distant shadow quality readouts.</p>
<p>As for how much these fixes have improved things performance-wise for PC Wilds, the verdict so far looks to be a bit mixed, with some folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0yeu/title_update_2_is_good/">reporting</a> that things are generally better and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0i4v/framerate_issues/">others</a> still seemingly running into crash and frame rate problems.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a sci-fi management game in which you remix your character's life history in a "Quantum Computer" to generate a workforce of deeply disturbed, borderline non-functional clones. In a twist so on-the-nose I can feel its fingers plucking at my olfactory bulb, developers 11 Bit Studios may have used generative AI to spawn or auto-translate parts of the in-game lore - despite the absence of a generative AI disclosure on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>The rumour bubbled up last week, when Reddit user EarthlingKira <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/">posted a screen</a> of an in-game mission log with the phrase "Sure, here's a revised version focussing purely on scientific and astronomical data". It reads pretty obviously like a chatbot response that was accidentally left in the text after it was generated and pasted into the game. Bluesky user Hietor De Paolo has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b">posted a screen</a> of a piece of dialogue, featuring the phrase "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is..." This suggests that 11 Bit also used ChatGPT or another genAI tool to translate the game's script.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam policies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">require developers</a> to tell players upfront whether they're using generative AI software, though the policy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">so vague as to be totally unhelpful</a>. There is no mention of generative AI on The Alters Steam page at the time of writing. Nor did the developers tell me they were using generative AI when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">broached the subject</a> at an event in Poland last year. They did have a booth at the event that let attendants create and chat to AI personas, but I perhaps naively took this for a stunt dreamed up by the PR team - there was no suggestion that any of it would be part of the game itself.</p>
<p>GenAI continues to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">a Trending Topic, with strong undertones of Discourse</a>. The industry's largest publishers, especially Microsoft, have bet billions on the success of generative AI tools of one kind or another. You can't sign into a Windows laptop these days without being harassed to generate something - go on, do it for uncle Satya Nadella.</p>
<p>While genAI appears to be widely used in game development as a continuation of older, less romanticised automation tools, many developers and creatives are rightly suspicious of the bigger promises around genAI, seeing the supposedly magical artmaking technology as a source of ugliness and error and a threat to their livelihoods, foisted on them by snake oil merchants who, for all their talk of <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/practical-ai-how-ludos-generative-ai-tools-aim-to-help-democratise-game-development/">"democratising"</a> the creative process, are only accountable to their shareholders. Unions have attempted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">put "guardrails"</a> on genAI in game development, with varying success.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, I wondered whether The Alters' premise of cloning a character from the protagonist's own backstory could be interpreted as a parody of how generative AI bots appropriate and regurgitate existing texts and imagery. Lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me that 11 Bit did consider making your space station's Quantum Computer a talking AI character, but this was not envisaged as an actual genAI bot, nor a commentary on today's genAI tools. "I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public," he said. Wlosek added that he was "very interested" in the discussion around generative AI and that 11 Bit "will be watching closely", but they had no plans to engage with the subject in The Alters.</p>
<p>I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification about the presence of genAI material in The Alters. I feel I should have been more on top of this, as the Rock Paper Servitor who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-alters-review">reviewed The Alters</a> and thought it was, on the whole, pretty decent. In my defence, I didn't spend much time combing the lore bits in the menus, because I was on deadline.</p>
<p>There's been some suggestion on Reddit that translation and optional lore writing are tertiary tasks, and thus, appropriate to hand off to a bot. This seems wildly silly. Translation and localisation are demanding and "creative" pursuits. Languages do not mesh easily - it takes wit and imagination to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-jolly-cooperation-of-localising-dark-souls">capture, say, the peculiarity of Dark Souls dialogue in English</a>. The Alters is about making subtle differentiations between versions of "the same" person. Choice of wording during dialogue was often key to my understanding of each Alter, and I have yet to encounter a chatbot capable of such delicacies. </p>
<p>As for lore document writing, you could say that my inattention to this side of The Alters during my review supports the view that it is an inessential extra. But come now - I don't think anyone can seriously dispute the importance of lore text to a sci-fantasy jobbie such as this.</p>
<p>In any case, the arguments about whether genAI can deliver on these fronts ignore the wider point that genAI is, essentially, just the latest way of trimming costs, shaving away labour and increasing output, to ensure that the industry can continue to be a mechanism of transferring wealth upwards. The Alters really does feel like an allegory for all that, despite 11 Bit's protestations - the basic stakes of the plot are that your employers want you to treat the Alters as bots, even as they protest that they are living beings who deserve a future. But this is a big, sticky issue that we probably need to revisit in op ed form. In the meantime, I'll let you know as and when we get clarity from 11 Bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure]]></content:encoded>
