            <p>Valor Mortis, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> set during Napoleon's 19th century conquest of Eastern Europe, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> devs One More Level during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>'s preshow. It's set for release in 2026.</p>
<p>Yep, if you're a fan of games that drip with Frenchness and also revolve around beating up gaudily-health barred baddies before they do the same to you, this one might have you reaching for your musket and bicorne. That's assuming the setting offers enough of a unique feel that Valor Mortis doesn't resemble being trapped on a Fromsoft-imitation Elba.</p>

<p>"“With Valor Mortis, we wanted to try something new and original - a darker experience, while still offering players a true challenge,” One More Level CEO Szymon Bryla said. “After Ghostrunner, we knew we had the foundation to create a [first-person] title, but this time in a soulslike genre. At the same time, we wanted to stay true to what we do best - making demanding games for hardcore players, set in an engaging, expansive world, while showing that the studio has grown since our previous projects.”</p><p>The game'll see you play as William, a Grande Armée soldier ressurected and given supernatural powers by the Nephtoglobin, a mysterious goop. Sadly, because video game, this goop has turned the world around him and his former comrades in arms into a plague-ridden hellscape prowled by mutants with extra limbs and bloated bodies.</p>
<p>The combat looks to add a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>-esque twist to the usual soulslike parry and dodge swordplay. You can dual-wield with guns like a flintlock pistol and abilities dubbed transmutations. The latter are William's magic powers, and remind me a lot of plasmids. This time, it looks like you'll be gaining the ability to shoot the likes of fire from your mitt by interacting with not quite dead bodies on the battlefield.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the trailer emphasises, it's that this game will not lack for battlefields full of dead bodies, with an entire montage dedicated to different locations in which the corpses are piled high. You'll be able to get a look at those corpse piles if you sign up for a closed Valor Mortis playtest that's set to kick off following Gamescom. Head to ValorMortis.com if you're keen.</p>
<p>Or, wait until the full release, which maths tells me is sadly more than a hundred days away.</p>
