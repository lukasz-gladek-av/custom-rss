            <p>Years after it was first leaked, and following weeks of increasingly loud rumours, Bethesda have finally shown off a trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remaster. It looks very shiny, and has a few new cogs under the hood. More importantly, it's out now.</p>

<p>First of all, here's the trailer.</p>

<p>It's £50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">on Steam</a>. A showcase of the game that aired alongside the trailer saw various developers talking over some of the biggest changes. This includes the ability to sprint, and a new levelling system described as a blend between Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, which presumably replaces the divisive level scaling of the original.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a new lip-syncing system that lets the funny puppets talk better, and some re-recorded dialogue lines to better fit all the fantasy races like Khajiit and Argonians. There's also a modernied third-person perspective (no more roller-skating up the mountainside). And all the assets have been remade, clearly, with real-time lighting, a heap of fresh VFX, a redesigned user interface, and new sound effects. </p>
<p>Other stuff remains mostly untouched. The lockpicking minigames and speechcraft persuasion has been left alone, we're told, apart from a visual redesign.</p>
<p>The open world fantasy RPG has been rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos, a support studio that handles a lot of different production jobs for various companies. They've been working on it alongside Bethesda's own studios. Despite all the assets being totally re-constructed using Unreal, the game is still running on some version of Bethesda's original Creation engine, we're told.</p>

<p>The remaster's existence has been a badly kept secret since 2023, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">leaked Microsoft documents</a> were spotted in during a court case, naming the game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3 and a possible remake or remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>. More recently, various leakers and rumourmongers started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">increasingly solid information</a> about the game, such as how its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">stamina and stealth will be reworked</a>. They also predicted it would be released in tandem with its announcement, you know, as a treat. </p>
<p>We'll be playing to find out just how much of a remaster it truly is. I'm interested to see how much of Oblivion's old-school charm is lost when you refurbish it and strip out what we today see as jank. Does it still crash zoom into a guard's face with alarming alacrity when you are apprehended for stealing an apple? Old games rebuilt can go either way for me. I found the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake a faithful adaptation that played with an old space in both clever and silly ways. But the recent Tomb Raider remasters made both me and Katherine sad with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-review">HD textures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-1-3-remastereds-modern-controls-are-an-absolute-travesty">wonky controls</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>It's a Marathon, not a race</p>

            <p>The closed alpha for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is soon due to roll out to players who signed up, meaning Bungie's colourful futuristic servers are warming up. Sadly, we weren't invited - the alpha is only open to North Americans. But, aha, something went awry today and the game became available to play early for those on Xbox. And one quick-witted player streamed a full hour of the game before the servers clamped shut once again. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Twitch user "bomberboyz130" began streaming the shooter today, after Bungie accidentally granted players on Xbox the ability to play too early. He played a handful of matches, most of them on a relatively small map called "Perimeter", getting into PvE scrapes with guard bots and robo-bugs before eventually escaping the map with some loot. He plays as a couple of the classes, including the tanky shield deploying Locus, and the smoke-bombing Void who can don stealth camouflage for a sure-to-be-nerfed 15 seconds. You can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2439585018">watch him play on Twitch</a> if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>The stream lasted over an hour until the servers went down and bomberboyz was booted out from even the menus. There were jokes in the chat about Bungie's death squads coming out of the woodwork to shut everything down and presumably put him in a big neon plastic bodybag (alpha players signed a non-disclosure agreement) but according to the developer this was all down to a technical cock-up that they've now corrected.</p>
<p>"We have fixed an issue where some Xbox players were able to access the Closed Alpha Playtest early," said Bungie on the game's official server. "All players with Closed Alpha access will be able to join on April 23 at 10AM Pacific."</p>
<p>So yeah, hopefully nobody needs to disappear. Not a soul here at RPS has had their hands on the game so far, like I say, but from this footage it seems in line with previews I've read. It appears to trek head-bobbingly down all the well-trodden extraction shooter paths, albeit with Bungie's chunky triggerfeels. It reminds me as much of battle royale <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> as it does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape From Tarkov</a>. The RPS treehouse is split as to whether the art style is eye-catching and cool or plastic and dull. </p>
<p>Marathon is due out September 23rd this year. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a> as a PvP reboot of Bungie's classic FPS for Macs. But its development has been troubled thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal layoffs</a> and a messy spat resulting from the game's former director being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">forced to step aside</a> over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">misconduct allegations</a>. Bungie eventually broke a long silence surrounding the game to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">reveal what it actually looked like</a> earlier this month. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>At some point in their development of the most recent trilogy, someone at Id Software apparently decided that the most interesting thing about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> was the character of the Doom Slayer himself - an odd though not entirely disastrous decision that I'd argue is mostly responsible for the design shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>. I'm a big fan, even despite this misplaced fascination with its unnecessarily fleshed out gun-numpad-with-legs. I'm hoping to be a fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> too, but based on the latest trailer, I'm still trying to tell whether they've scaled the Slayer lore back or are still banking on me being enraptured to learn the millenia-long backstory to why I'm yanking a Cacodemon's eyeball out like clogged hair from shower drain.</p>

<p>While I can absolutely do without top brass pacing around by control panels and chewing walkie talkies anywhere near my Doom, I'm actually quite on board with the vaguely modern military vibes for one reason: the true scale and threat of a hell invasion is much better felt with a front seat to the carnage these murderlopers can inflict on people who aren't the Slayer. When all you've got is the perspective of an invincible hammer, even the most fearsome demon looks like a squishy pissnail. It's just plain fun to feel like you're taking part in a war that's going disastrously for every idiot but you.</p>
<p>We're also shown a bit of what I'm assuming is the game's central antagonist. He uses at least a couple of differently pitched audio tracks to speak, so you know he's from one of the really bad circles of hell. I think he looks cool!  The contrast between the sleek if medieval future tech and the more organic and biblical looking demons makes for great art direction. He <em>sort of</em> looks like a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> boss, but art was one the few things about Diablo 4 that didn't make me want to weave my eyes shut forever with my own lashes.</p>
<p>It's not all story, though. There's a fair chunk of bulletous gut mulching in there too - although it's still a little hard to tell if the game's many combat options will flow together this smoothly, or if it's just being played by someone good. Perhaps you'd like to investigate further? Brendy went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-threw-hands-with-doom-the-dark-ages-and-its-rock-em-sock-em-robot">hands-on with its giant mechs here</a>, and then got so cocky he decided to play with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-the-hell-not-lets-slide-all-doom-the-dark-ages-difficulty-options-to-max">all the difficulty sliders whacked up to max</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
