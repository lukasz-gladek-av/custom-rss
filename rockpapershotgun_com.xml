Fishing, I think, is the truest of all video game power fantasies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">Action</a> hero combat, romance wish fulfilment, god like abilities, all of that sort of thing pales in comparison to the act of fishing in a game. Just you, your rod, and a whole load of open water. I love to fish in video games, despite not being someone that has a strong desire to 100% genres like collectathons, I do love getting as many fish as I can, and I love a twist on the format. Enter Out Fishing, a mysterious sounding horror fishing game.
</p>

<p>
Where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> sees you setting out into the open ocean on a boat to get the eldritch catch of the day, Out Fishing almost takes a calmer, more laid back approach. You have your own little camp near a lake, you can improve things like your rod strength and your reeling speed. Classic gamey kind of things, things you'd expect from a cosier game than this one, but then there's the fact that if you stay past sunset, you're greeted with… something, in the forest. Don't know what, but I hate the woods at night, so I'm already just a little bit anxious thinking about it.

I also really like one of the key features listed over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660260/Out_Fishing/">game's Steam page</a>: "A single, horrifying goal: reel in the one thing that was never meant to be found." That could literally mean anything. A dead body? A really weird fish? Repressed memories of a traumatic event? That last one sounds likely given that the devs cited Silent Hill as an influence (alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mundaun">Mundaun</a>).
</p>
<p>
What I am curious about is how connected the horror elements will actually feel to the fishing side of things. I'm hoping the two will tie into each other rather than feeling like separate games. I won't find out for a while though, as there's no release date. I'll stick to the slightly less scary Sega Bass Fishing in the meantime.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> publishers HoYoverse are suing a player for $150,000 over a pre-release stream of a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a> character.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse">reported</a> by Nicole Carpenter over on the Gamefile newsletter (paywall), the Singapore-based publishers are taking one Alfredo Lopez to court after he broadcast an early look at Castorice, a melancholy floral dragon summoner, to a Discord channel with around 12,000 members. The lawsuit was filed on June 6th in the United States District Court's Central District of California.</p>
<p>According to HoYoverse's copyright claim, Lopez has "unfairly or unlawfully obtained a game update before its release date", but the suit appears more vexed by Lopez sharing footage of the character, than how he obtained the game build in question. </p>
<p>They argue that a leak such as this "dampens the excitement and anticipation that many players feel when they obtain the update legitimately upon its official release." It's worth noting that Castorice had already been revealed as an upcoming addition to the game - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-honkai-star-rail-amphoreus-trailer-featuring-castorice-revealed-the-game-awards-2024">during last December's Game Awards, no less</a>. </p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a live service gacha game, with around 70 characters at the time of writing. Jason Coles thought it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/honkai-star-rail-review">good fun</a> back in April 2023. I can see how the publisher of a game which thrives on the lure of randomly served or microtransacted anime fancy-dans might be extra prickly about having the goods screened ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on billion-dollar publishers suing Discord streamers into the scorched earth over footage of a character we already know about.</p>
<p>As Carpenter comments in the newsletter, HoYoverse have proven <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-43885b83-8690-4687-9574-a8029abd586f.html?stream=top">pretty militant about going after leakers in the past</a>, though they're hardly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-sue-over-fortnite-superhero-leak">alone in this</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I find Fortnite's desperation to be the everything game both fascinating and overwhelming. There's always something new for you to do around the corner, some new game mode that's attempting to tap into current trends of whatever it is that kids are into at any given moment. Currently, on the younger audience side of things with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Epic Games are launching Expeditions, a new wave-based mode that looks like a bit of a blend between a hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be honest, the framing of the whole thing is very much not for me, because I am not a child. A place called the Supernova Academy acts as your base before you head out on PvE missions all in the hopes of stopping "the evil Mask Maker Daigo from destroying the world". It's as generic a setup as can be, which I feel is a shame because kids do deserve quality storytelling, something which Fortnite itself isn't awful at (I don't love the FOMO nature of its events, but it's certainly Doing Something at the very least).

Missions see you facing down hordes of enemies as is typical of the wave-based format, there's a map to explore with Lego people to rescue and resources, money, and gear to gather up. You also have different hero classes to choose from, like one that can fly around to get a lay of the land, another can use rifts and summon crystals to deal damage to a bunch of enemies, you get how this all works.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing very much feels like it was made for kids who think the big boy shooters their siblings or teenagers are playing online look really cool, but obviously are far from old enough to play. This is a Fortnite mode though, as cynical as I might feel about this thing, I'm sure it'll do well enough.

<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions is launching tomorrow, June 18th.
