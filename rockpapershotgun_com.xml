These days, most sequels to even the most popular of games are announced a good while after whatever the latest title is. I mean, just look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, we've known it's been in the works for a while now, but it only got a formal reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">last December</a>, almost a full decade after The Witcher 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber</a> didn't wait around to announce a follow-up to last year's very popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, though, revealing that a third game is in the works just this month, about half a year on from its release. Even still, Saber would like you to know that this doesn't mean it's "abandoning" Space Marine 2.
</p>

<p>
In an update post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500568489646358807?curator_clanid=3693985">Steam</a>, Saber "set the record straight" on whether updates on Space Marine 2 would be slowing down, explaining that there aren't any team rearrangements taking place, and "no one is abandoning the game." There's still apparently plans for more content for "months to come", emphasising the Space Marine 3 is still "years away from release."
</p>
<p>
In fact, said update post even offered a few bits for the game's upcoming patch 7.0, the Trygon Update. This one's planned for a mid-April release, and is adding in a few bits and pieces. First up are a couple of DLC packs, one being the Space Wolves Chapter Pack which is, you guessed it, wolf themed, netting you a metallic wolf helmet, a wolf's head pelt for your shoulder, and some other bits, as well as an Imperial Fists Champion Pack, which mostly just makes you look a lot more yellow and a bit more regal.
</p>
<p>
A new map will also be coming to PvE called Exfiltration, which will (unsurprisingly given the name of the update) have the Trygon as a boss, a nasty, Xenomorph-looking alien that I wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole. You'll also be able to set up private lobbies in PvP, and a couple of general additions like a weapons perks rework and some new colours are coming too. See, more stuff! And you were worried.
