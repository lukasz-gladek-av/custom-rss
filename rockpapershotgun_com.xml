            <p>If you peered into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-borderlands-4-celestial-empire-building-and-the-first-big-dune-awakening-dlc">Edwin's maw</a> this morning, you might have seen that Trainatic's out today, September 8th. Well, having now given its demo a go, I can waft away a bit more of the billowing steam of mystery for those standing on the platform who're considering boarding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's a thing you'll say very quickly once you fire up either the demo or full version of this train-builder from developer Ryan Forrester, whose previous works include idle frog collector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/croakoloco-is-not-an-idle-game-because-simply-being-around-frogs-is-a-powerfully-worthwhile-activity">Croakoloco</a> and cleaning sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113490/Mess_Quest/?curator_clanid=43192431">Mess Quest</a>. It's the following: 'Oh crikey, my train's stopped already.'</p>
<p>You see, while the aim of the game is to build a train that can chug along for ages, the loco you start with runs out of fuel when it's barely left the station. That's ok, though. You've got a machine gun perched on the single car behind your engine, and you can use it to shoot some trees during your next trip. This, as well as just running over trees which are perched too close to the tracks (though that understandably damages your loco), is how you gather resources to upgrade the train.</p>
<p>With fuel being the limiting factor on journey length early doors, I invested in improvements to both capacity and efficiency for that off the bat. Soon, with help from an upgrade that let me add an extra car to my train, beginning the process of <strong>enlengthening</strong>, I had a fuel support carriage which would replenish a bit of fuel whenever I shot a tree with my gun.</p>

<p>From there, I began to upgrade the likes of my loco's speed, its firepower, and its storage capacity. Some of the numbers assigned to these upgrades seemed a bit nebulous in terms of how exactly they corresponded to my loco's performance on the tracks, but I didn't much mind that given Trainatic's relatively chill approach to things. As a result of what's a bit of a grindy start, though everything's simple and quick enough that it doesn't drag, I started going on journeys that felt a bit less like brief jaunts down the road. That's when I saw it.</p><p>A pinkish purple orb, spinning its way across the dark and earthy terrain of the woodland surrounding the tracks. Back at the station, a line from my faceless trainmaster, speculating about some strange power that could be linked to the neon interloper. Hmmm.</p>
<p>While I've unlocked automatic acceleration to go alongside the automatic trigger finger Trainatic offers, it's not enough of an idler that I'll be able to pursue this orbnigma while doing something far less important in another tab. So, my full attention will have to be on the train building, the task of taping together a Thomas the tank teeming with tech to ponder those damn orbs.</p>
<p>So far, the game's steadily constructing what almost feels like a stripped-back rail roguelike, and one that's worth at least hopping on for a free test ride. If you fancy doing so, you can find both the demo and full version of Trainatic on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Steam</a>, with the latter costing £3.99/$4.79/€4.71 as of writing, thanks to an offer running until September 22nd.</p>

            <p>Steam tells me I've spent 171 hours of my life to this point playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>. It's not an insignificant amount of time, but it pales in comparison to how long I've spent with the myriad other works of developers Bethesda. Said devs now look like they might have fired up the tease rocket for the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s second major expansion. If they have, the very little they've shown off so far hasn't gotten me right on board to play more.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Almost a year since Starfield's first DLC, Shattered Space, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-shattered-space-looks-like-a-wise-return-to-bethesda-basics">unleashed its spooky gunk</a>, Bethesda commemorated the second anniversary of the game's release by tweeting the short video below.</p> <div>

<p>Yep, the piss filter of teaseage was whipped out, with fans rearranging the frames in such fashion that they read "Terran Armada". Naturally, the conclusion jumped to by plenty of folks is that this could be the name of the second expansion the developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-will-get-at-least-one-more-expansion-after-shattered-space-todd-howard-says">had set in stone for a while</a>, but haven't said anything about beyond that.</p>
<p>The name suggests a fleet of ships from or somehow related to Earth, and if that's the case, my feelings are best summed up by a straight-faced shrug. As much as judging a Bethesda DLC by the name's pretty pointless, in the absence of any other info, the idea of an expansion focused around Earthly matters doesn't get me too excited.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Let me outline why. With its relative lack of aliens outside of hostile planet-dwelling creatures, a fairly dry and scientific NASA-inspired brand of sci-fi, and the fate of Earth being a key thread in its main plot, Starfield feels to me like it's done plenty of Earthy stuff already. It's even done the idea of a ship full of folks from Earth randomly popping up to beef with the residents of the Settled Systems. Remember visiting Paradiso on Porrima II, then serving as the middleperson between the resort and the Earth Colony Ship Constant, the latter of which had somehow managed to roam through space encountering nobody else for about 200 years?</p><p>I do, and it was perfectly meh. That's not to say a DLC couldn't put a twist on a tale like that or find another, intriguing way to revamp the relatively featureless sand-ball that was Starfield's ruined Earth. However, as I outlined when I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/starfield-shattered-space-review">reviewed the Shattered Space expansion</a> at my former home, my view's long been that the best way Bethesda can utilise Starfield DLC is to paint a bit more colour and vibrance onto the canvas of an impressively vast but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfields-abandoned-gore-and-dismemberment-system-sure-would-have-made-it-less-grey">often quite bland</a> universe.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that first DLC was about snake worshippers on a purple planet, so you can argue that for variety's sake trying to go the weird and alien route again wouldn't be ideal. Though, I reckon at this point you might as well embrace the out-there ideas. No one DLC's going to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-individually-rebutting-starfield-steam-reviewers-defending-the-loading-breaks-and-empty-worlds">rehabilitate Starfield's reputation</a> from would-be masterpiece that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">didn't measure up to the endless hype</a>, to universally beloved sibling of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout juggernauts. </p>
<p>A sequel would have that chance, though, assuming it arrived before the actual heat-death of our universe. So, why not go after the strange and unique, as those other Bethesda-helmed series I've just cited have in some of their strongest and most memorable moments, both in the publisher's hands and outside of them? Even if the game ends up being a one-off, have it go out with one or a series of supernova explosions, rather than the cosmic whimper of an aging comet.</p>
<p>We'll just have to see which of those "Terran Armada" ends up being, assuming it's a DLC tease and not just Todd Howard's lunch order.</p>
