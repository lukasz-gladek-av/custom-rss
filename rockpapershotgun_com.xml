Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is not the third game in a series about creepy rednecks and dinosaurs in a mansion. I'd forgive you if that was where your mind went, given the number three in its name, but I assure you, it's a brand new game that just came out today! It is also a match-3, survival horror, comedy RPG metroidvania, a combination of genres that I never thought was possible, and yet here we are with a game that looks pretty fun.

Here's the thing that'll probably make the name click for you: it was made by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/strange-scaffold">Strange Scaffold</a>, the same studio that brought you games about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-we-just-went-an-entire-year-where-every-game-was-as-short-cheap-and-existentially-harrowing-as-clickolding-thatd-be-great-thanks">clicking and cuckolding</a>, about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strange-scaffolds-next-game-is-about-stalking-and-sacrificing-your-neighbours-to-keep-the-world-from-ending">stalking and sacrificing your neighbours to keep the world from ending</a>, and about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator-is-out-now">becoming a space warlord organ trader</a>. That Strange Scaffold.

To maybe actually explain Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 (say that three times fast), it is a sequel to a game series that doesn't exist. There's even a fictional game developer that made it, and writer Xalavier Nelson Jr. even kindly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lnevpsezbk27">dug into the lore a little bit in a recent video</a>. The things you are specifically matching three of are DNA bubbles, which you do so in order to "keep your psychic clone from invading your mind and turning you into a cannibal." Look, I'm going to keep explaining the game, but if you're not sold already I might be judging you a little bit.
</p>
<p>
You'll be matching three in combat, for lockpicking, debatingâ€¦ swallowing diamonds, apparently. I'm not exactly sure where the metroidvania element comes into it, though I'd certainly like to find out. Just all around it's a very neat and silly sounding game, and if you're as interested as I am, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116510/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3/">head over to Steam to check it out</a>.
