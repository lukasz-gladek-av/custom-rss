            <p>Remember in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers when Gandalf falls down the big chasm with the Balrog, smacking the sawdust out of it while plummeting towards the waters of the underworld? Well, give Gandalf a gun, play that sequence in reverse, and swap the Balrog for a flock of Space Invaders, and you are playing something like the demo for Dwarf Legacy – a “bullet-hell precision platformer” from Wulo Games about a dwarf clambering up the inside of a mountain. </p>
<p>Oh wait, Gandalf needs to be listening to crunchy dancefloor music to complete the analogy. Also, he needs to stop periodically to buy better guns from a blacksmith. I’m pretty sure this is still within Peter Jackson’s budget.</p><!--more-->

<p>“Bullet-hell precision platformer” is a verbal fondue calculated to give you palpitations, so it’s alarming that Dwarf Legacy feels very easy, to begin with. Your jump is insanely floaty, and you can stick to walls without worrying about stamina. This isn’t exactly your classic, slow-moving, hard-wearing Dwarven miner. Even Legolas wasn’t this quick on his pins.</p><p>The odds soon steepen, however. The gun, once acquired, can only be shot in fixed directions – vertically, if you’re jumping or standing on the floor, or horizontally, if you’re hanging from a wall. Upgrade the gun to fire an extra bullet per shot, and the additional rounds shoot out parallel or at 45 degree diagonals, as with multishot upgrades in shmups.</p>
<p>Those constraints are all fine and dandy when you’re only fighting a handful of foes, and have room to manoeuvre. But when you’re dogfighting with a crowd in cramped confines, while avoiding spinning blade traps and spikes… yes, this is a test of Dawi mettle indeed. Fortunately, enemies take damage from traps, and have deliberately brainless pathfinding - some gauntlet runs encourage you to lure them to their destruction.</p>
<p>Between clambers, you’ll return to and gradually populate a cave village of upgrade-peddling NPCs. There’s some gently diverting writing, like the botanist who’s ecstatic at the chance to grow vegetables in pitch darkness. Another dweller offers optional challenges to encourage replay of completed areas, on top of the bonuses you'll earn from a higher completion score.</p><p> 

The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2426280/Dwarf_Legacy/">full version of Dwarf Legacy</a> is out later this year, and will offer a few dozen levels across several distinct chunks of mountain strata. Oh, I forgot to mention a couple of Neat things. Firstly, when you grab a surface your character automatically plants a torch, lighting the level in an organic way.
</p><p>Secondly, when you take damage, it dings your helmet off rather than killing you. You can reclaim your helmet to restore that diegetic second chance mechanic. I’d almost beaten the 10th level in the demo, but then some stinkbug bonked my hat off a precipice and I chased it almost all the way to the bottom. Fun! It occurs to me that Gandalf lost his hat during the Balrog descent, and somehow reached the bottom unscathed – truly, he is the, er, Dwarf Legacy of wizards.</p>

            <p>What Steam operators Valve are and aren't prepared to allow onto their storefront has been a major talking point for the past year or so, especially when it comes to mature or sexually-themed content. Our Edwin's done some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">fine reporting on the topic</a> and how it relates to payment processors, as well as delving into individual cases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">Santa Ragione's Horses</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developers of point-and-click comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/point-and-click-adventure-game-filled-with-ah-yeah-them-british-actors-earth-must-die-is-out-later-this-month">Earth Must Die</a> say things looked "unclear" for a bit in terms of whether they'd be able to launch on Steam, with the platform then offering a thumbs up after reviewing footage of an "alien orgy".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy," publishers No More Robots told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/valve-needed-to-verify-footage-of-the-alien-orgy-in-earth-must-die-before-it-was-allowed-to-launch-on-steam/#viafoura-comments">Painting Collection Gamer</a>. "We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification."</p>
<p>Thankfully, once that footage was sent over, approval was forthcoming. That said, whether on Valve's orders or by No More Robots' own volition, Earth Must Die's Steam page bears a mature content warning specifying that "there is a puzzle that takes place in an alien adult bookshop, and an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor".</p><p>As much as it's funny to imagine a Valve staffer examining footage of cartoon extraterrestrials going at it, No More Robots' retelling of the events paints what's turned into an amusing anecdote as something that could potentially have thrown a major spanner in the works. If games that dabble in jokey depictions of shagging face that sort of gaze into the void, right up until they're sure Valve are 100% satisfied, one can only imagine the uncertainty more serious explorations of mature themes might encounter.</p>
<p>On one hand, Valve have a right to apply the rules they decide to enforce on their storefront, even if said storefront's domination of the PC space makes such calls far weightier than they might otherwise be. On the other, as Edwin's reported, the matter of credit card companies and payment processors influencing what those rules - and the rules of other storefronts - are when it comes specifically to adult content complicates the matter significantly.</p>
<p>At least in this case, the alien orgy made it through whatever contextual hoops it needed, so that No More Robots' game about British actors and comics quipping their way through a tale about a martian ruler doing quirky stuff could drop as planned this week.</p>
