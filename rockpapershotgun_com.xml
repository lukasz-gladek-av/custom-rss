            <p>Bit of an odd one in businessworld. Ubisoft have handed the job of selling their upcoming fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era">Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era</a> to another publisher. Hooded Horse are taking on that task, a crowd you might know as the purveyor of other strategical capers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a> and the like. Experienced tactics barons and ostensibly the right bunch for the job. The question that's bugging me is: why? The answer is probably: money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are thrilled to welcome Hooded Horse aboard to support the next chapter of Heroes of Might and Magic," said Alain Corre, Ubi's chief publishing officer. "Their passion for the franchise and strong connection with strategy communities make them the perfect complement to Unfrozen’s creative talent."</p>
<p>Unfrozen are the studio who're actually making the game, and who likewise say they are "very excited" to be casting their spells under the watchful gaze of Tim Bender, the CEO of Hooded Horse, whose steadily growing payload of strategy games grows ever more threatening to the western world. </p>
<p>"This is a unique relationship," said a representative from Hooded Horse, who clarified that the strategy specialists will be taking over the "day-to-day operations of publishing" the game, and will be listed alongside Ubi on the Steam page.</p>
<p>"Hooded Horse will serve as publisher like it does for all of its other titles, but Ubisoft remains in the picture as well, supporting where needed, and it also remains the owner of the Heroes IP."</p>
<p>It's hard to know the exact reasons for offloading such a game to another publisher, but it's possibly a result of Ubisoft's ongoing internal fidgeting - a decision that benefits some spreadsheet somewhere in the blue-lit bowels of the accounting department. Press releases like the one quoted above don't normally enlighten anyone as to the real logic behind the slow and inscrutable movements of large companies. 

</p><p>For their part, Unfrozen say publishing with Hooded Horse "means more marketing support, better visibility, and helps extend our reach to more regions." But it's hard to understand why a giant like Ubisoft couldn't provide such things themselves. We've asked them for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft split into two separate entities</a>, like some freaky dungeon slime. One big Tencent-flavoured subsidiary carved off Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six , and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, while other games (your Princes of Persia, your Raymans) remained more firmly on the French behemoth's plate. Since then Ubisoft have warned of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">delays and cost-cutting</a>. This deal with Hooded Horse might simply be one of those cost-cutting measures. </p>
<p>As for the game itself, Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-announce-new-back-to-roots-heroes-of-might-magic-game-with-the-iratus-devs-in-charge">announced last year</a> and its early access release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3105440/view/585018505747763751?snr=1_5_9_">has been delayed until later this year</a>, say the developers. It's a turn-based strategy prequel that wants to go back to the series roots. You'd have to get some mucky hands to find those roots - they're buried back in 1995. I'll probably sit it out, for fear of 30 years of lore. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: I worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a> as a writer, which was eventually published by Hooded Horse.</em></p>

            <p>Howdy, pardner. Been a while, ain't it? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a>'s just gotten a fresh update that surprisingly adds some new missions, three or so years after Rockstar gave up on delivering major updates to the cowboy sandbox. Oh, and one of them looks to involve you investigating some zombie plague outbreaks.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit Undead Nightmare-ish to me, and these sudden new additions have folks wondering if Rockstar's trying to bring the game back from the grave.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rockstar look to have pre-emptively shared some details about the contents of RDO's July update with some of its <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1939768963572896202">community</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/"> members</a> yesterday, and among the usual list of monthly in-game discounts and bonuses, revealed that some new content's dropping.</p>
<p>"Author Theodore Levin needs your help investigating the bizarre and unexplained in Strange Tales of the West," the studio purportedly wrote, "a new set of four eerie Telegram Missions available tomorrow in Red Dead Online. Track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more." Yep, undead plagues.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>New Red Dead Online content coming tomorrow as part of the event month, announced in a community email:</p><p>Strange Tales of the West includes a set of new Telegram missions, book author Theodore Levin (from the singleplayer) needs help investigating “bizarre and unexplained”… <a href="https://t.co/9OenzdOPiD">pic.twitter.com/9OenzdOPiD</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1939765713310220411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As of this writing, there isn't a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire?tag_id=736">Rockstar Newswire post</a> formally announcing the arrival of these missions, but the update appears to have gone live as of 5am EDT/10am BST today, July 1st, with one player already having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1lox584/holy_shit_its_real/">shared a screenshot</a> showing a notification inviting them to help Levin. Meanwhile, another's been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1loz0jo/robots_with_fire_bows_in_the_old_west_way_to_go/">shot by a robot with a fire bow</a>.</p>
<p>While these do look to just be a few extra missions, their arrival's still raised some eyebrows among those still playing the game, with folks wondering how they came to be and why they've been deployed now.</p>
<p>You see, the past few years have been pretty lean in terms of new stuff being added to Red Dead Online, with Rockstar having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-abandon-major-red-dead-online-updates-to-focus-on-gta-6">made the call in 2022</a> to cease major updates, so they could focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>. GTA Online's still been recieving regular updates with plenty of fresh additions in that time, so you can see why RDO players felt compelled to organise an in-game funeral for the online cowboy thing a few years ago.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how expansive these missions are and whether there's any other stuff in the works for the few outlaws still roaming the west.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-online-just-got-some-surprise-new-missions-and-one-involves-investigating-undead-plagues]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> update includes a new, heavily upgraded performance monitor, stacking readouts for framerate, CPU, GPU, and memory usage data on top of the previously basic FPS overlay. It’s "a first step," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500576552635859540">so say Valve</a>, "towards helping Steam users more easily understand their game and system performance," and as such includes some counters and metrics that you won’t see even on game-math classics like MSI Afterburner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The most straightforward of these is the option to separate framerate counts by both traditionally rendered frames and any extras that might be served up by frame generation tech such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>. Existing hardware monitors can usually measure either the raw, un-generated frame count or the combined total, but to my knowledge, Steam’s the first to keep track of both separately – allowing you to see precisely how much of that on-screen smoothness is down to 'real' frames versus the generated ones. Handy stuff.</p>
<p>This new overlay (which, by the way, can be customised to show varying degrees of details, similar to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>/SteamOS performance monitor) offers some other convention-breaking counters too. The CPU usage monitor is one: in addition to a standard, percentage-based figure showing average CPU core usage, it can also display a second percentage that denotes the current busiest core, specifically how much it’s working relative to its base clock speed. Hence why it sometimes reads above 100% - that’s when the core is running at its higher 'boost' clock speed, to get more done when thermal headroom allows it to.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is useful info, not because anyone secretly wants to sit an arithmetic exam when they sit down to play games, but because average core usage doesn’t give the full picture when a game perhaps isn’t taking advantage of CPU cores like it should. Showing, in real time, that the busiest core is in fact working its little silicon arse off could help diagnose performance problems that may not otherwise have a clear cause.</p>
<p>There’s a similar troubleshooting benefit to how the Steam monitor counts VRAM availability, which takes into account the amount of system RAM that temporarily holds graphics data. Some monitors, and the VRAM counters you often see in graphics settings menus, only consider the GPU’s own memory alone, so if the Steam overlay says you’re maxing out your supply, you can be more sure that you really have squeezed out every last gigabyte of possible memory. That’s my understanding, anyway. I’m still just a humanities graduate, and this thing makes an awful lot of numbers.</p>
<p>Having played around with the monitor myself, I have noticed one bug, which you can see for yourself in that header screenshot: the generated frames counter sometimes doesn’t show in full, so what should be a count of three-hundred-and-something frames looks like 30. I sort-of fixed this by switching DLSS Multi Frame Generation from 4x to 2x and back again, but hopefully a more permanent amendment is due. Already, though, this is another mostly-great feature that Steam has almost nonchalantly slotted into itself. A repeat of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-record-game-clips-with-steam">Game Recording</a> launch, but for helping when things break, rather than showing off.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-updated-pc-performance-monitor-is-quietly-clever-and-not-just-because-it-digs-into-frame-generation]]></content:encoded>
