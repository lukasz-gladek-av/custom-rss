            <p>Ok, so you remember how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> arrived on PC and immediately there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">more smutty mods</a> than you could shake a fleshy stick at?</p>
<p>Well, the new Zone Kit modding tools <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> got as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">yesterday's big patch</a> have done something similar, but with memey jank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd expect given the Zone Kit takes up a very small 700GB of your hard drive and only came out the other day, there aren't too many mods out there that make use of it. However, taking a glance at how its <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2?date_live=Last+year">Mod.IO</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1643320/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> pages are building up at this early stage, there are still a number of works that'll, er, transform your zoning experience.</p>
<p>Homing in on Mod.IO specifically, 19 of the 61 mods currently up on there are by the same author, Sanekum, whom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-artist-kickstarts-the-zone-kit-modding-scene-with-a-flood-of-glorious-nonsense-mods-featuring-shrek-cj-and-you-guessed-it-thomas-the-tank-engine/">PC Gamer</a> note looks like they could be GSC 3D Artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sanekum">Aleksandr Silantev</a>.</p>
<p>That 31.15% (I have double checked the maths) of the total Stalker mods on the platform include the likes of <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/swampboss2#description">Shrek</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/cj-bloodsucker#description">CJ</a> from San Andreas cameos, but as a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-i-saw-her">serious</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">journalist</a> I'm interested in keeping things <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>. To that end, Sanekum offers the chance to pick up an <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/rpg-melee-combat#description">RPG grenade</a>, or an even deadlier <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/melee-nettle-branch#description">nettle branch</a>, and attempt to beat to death some <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sherman-boar#description">Sherman tanks</a> that've been drafted in to replace boars.</p>
<p>What do you mean that's not <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>? Clearly the Sherman tanks are being operated by the boars, who've just been magicked inside of them and given the sort of army training required to operate an armoured fighting vehicle with their little hooves. In the same way that <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sidorovich-handgun#description">this mod</a> which turns a mini-Sidorovich into a handgun makes perfect anatomical sense.
</p>
<p>Aside from those, a fair few of these early Mod.IO works for Stalker look to be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1312">existing</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/634">things</a> from places like Nexus Mods being <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/weapon-reposition-project-tacticool#description">ported</a> <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/main-menu-animated-ferris-wheel-4k60fps#description">across</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be cool to see what Stalker's notoriously enthusiastic modding community can get up to once they've had time to buy an entire new PC just to ensure they've got the space needed to install the Zone Kit and a chance to play around with it properly. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-some-nettles-defeat-wild-pigs-in-sherman-tanks-thanks-to-stalker-2s-new-modding-tools-you-can-find-out]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Following a tumultuous year for workers at the French studio</p>

            <p>French studio Don't Nod have laid off workers across multiple departments. The full number is unconfirmed, but multiple affected staff have posted about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshv5ffj6c22/quotes">their departures on LinkedIn</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> principal cinematic artist Mary Pouliot, technical artist Laurent Dufrense, and QA lead Sandra Cormier.</p>
<p>It's been a rocky year or so for Don't Nod's staff. Last September, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">paused two unannounced games</a> and said they're altering others, also unannounced, to be more appealing to a "wider audience", following warnings about an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. Chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert attributed this to (the excellent) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden</a> performing "well below expectations" commercially.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Back in February of the same year, French union STJV alleged mismanagement at Don't Nod, including "contradictory" directions, shifting deadlines, and "no long-term vision" for staff welfare (cheers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">Eurogamer</a>). Following September's statements from Guilbert, the STJV published another statement of their own, accusing Don't Nod of creating "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leadership-at-dont-nod-are-creating-an-atmosphere-of-extreme-violence-with-planned-layoffs-says-french-game-workers-union">an atmosphere of extreme violence</a>” with planned layoffs and mistreatment of staff.</p>
<p>(I figure it's worth nothing here, re: the perhaps contentious use of the term "violence" that a.) French works differently to English and b.) the damage caused by extreme stress brought about from job precarity can obviously be genuinely physically harmful. Living under the protective shroud of being one degree of removal and deniability from the most literal definition of violence is how some of the worst people on the planet continue to be allowed to show their horrible little faces in public, after all.)</p>
<p>Sorry about that, had brief <em>commie flush</em>. Must be the weather. Ahem. "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months", said the STJV at the time, saying that around 29% of the Paris studio's workforce could be at risk of losing their jobs. This coincided with another statement from Guilbert saying Don't Nod would be undergoing a "reorganisation project". Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">an IGN report</a>, Don't Nod announced they were expecting to lay off employees at this time.</p>
<p>The numbers get a little bit hard to track from that point. In a <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2025/04/08/don_t-nod-provides-an-update-on-its-strategy-implementation-to-adapt-to-new-market-conditions">strategy document</a> from April of this year, Don't Nod said that "ultimately, 59 job cuts are planned, including 12 departures that have not been replaced since the announcement". Last month, STJV <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/05/looking-back-on-the-fight-against-layoffs-at-dont-nods/">announced</a> that they'd "secured 23 voluntary redundancies for job categories not threatened by the plan, in order to save as many colleagues from being fired", as well as securing severance and strike pay. "Instead of the 69 layoffs initially planned, there were 46 voluntary departures and 1 layoff," STJV write (Thanks, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/543386/article/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-studio-dont-nod-montreal-has-2nd-round-of-layoffs-after-union-intervened-the-1st-time/">Gameranx</a>).</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current round of layoffs. The STJV have yet to comment publicly. I've reached out to them, as well as Don't Nod to confirm the number of layoffs at the studio, and I'll update this if and when I know. Best of luck to all affected. Again, Jusant was bloody brilliant.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
