Match-3 games are probably the purest out there, at least in terms of genre. They are so instantly understandable by pretty much anyone, no wonder there's a seemingly infinite number of them available on our phones. The issue is that most of them can't match up to the heights of a classic like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, though at least every once in a while we get delightful spins on the genre like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spirit-swap">Spirit Swap</a>. Now, there's a new, quite tiny new kid on the block in the form of Sinister Sodies, a match-3 game where you set out to "purify your carbonated concoction before time runs out."
</p>

<p>
Sinister Sodies has the usual thing you'll find in a match-3 game, i.e. different coloured tiles you have to match up. The particular spin here is that rather than like in other games in the genre where you might move a tile to get a match, you have to box specific combinations of three tiles in by drawing a four-cornered box.

It sounds simple enough, but there's a fast-paced time limit, so in the first instance you have to find a spot that includes your three target tiles before you can even match them up. This gets complicated by things like tiles that explode if you draw a line through them, more and more of said tiles appearing as you make matches. 
</p>
<p>
I really like this little twist on the genre, there's a snappiness to it thanks to the timer that really helps it to feel satisfying when you just manage to make a match. Not enough to make you want to play it for hours on end, but I can see myself coming back to this for five minutes pop when I need a break from writing about the latest Fortnite update or whatever it is games journalists do these days.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I'm most fond of is the presentation. It all looks like a piece of claymation, rendered in artist Crisppyboat's own signature style. I feel like it's a game that would have fit very well on Cartoon Network's Flash games site back when that was still a thing. Real "killing time on the family computer while your mum is getting ready for the school run" kind of vibe in the most positive of ways possible.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3752580/Sinister_Sodies/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://goblin-laundromat.itch.io/sinister-sodies">itch.io</a>, and it's cheap as chips, so you've not got much of an excuse to not get it honestly.

            <p>
Crytek had a little bit of an oopsie yesterday with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown 1896's</a> 2.4 update yesterday. As soon as it arrived, there were reports of server problems and issues with buying Blood Bonds. This led to Crytek trying to fix it, taking the game's servers offline to do so, except when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was brought back online, it wasn't with a fixed version of the new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859005?l=english">but version 2.3</a>. However! It looks like the team continued work on getting it fixed (hope you didn't have to crunch too hard, Crytek staff), and the update is back and available to download.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Our team has been working tirelessly to resolve the issues that followed the original rollout, and after extensive testing and final checks, we’re confident in this new release," Crytek explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859184?l=english">Steam post</a>. "We’ll continue monitoring stability closely and remain committed to delivering the best possible experience moving forward." For what it's worth, now that the update is live and stable, <a href="https://x.com/HuntShowdown/status/1935431568409116845">you'll be able to redeem a code for 10,000 Hunt dollars as compensation</a> (I'd also like to take a second to note how funny Hunt dollars is as a name, couldn't figure out anything else huh).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the actual content of the update, also called the Judgement of the Fool update, it goes as follows: there's a new area called The Fool's Hideout to explore, where you can use Pledge Marks to unlock Sealed Rewards. The map DeSalle is back too, "revitalized with significant enhancements." 
</p>
<p>
There's a new Catalyst Trait too, which "unlocks powerful Conditional Trait Effects for specific Traits when they’re equipped on your Hunter." And there's also The Brute, a "formidable offspring of Ursa Mortis" that is stealthy in nature, so keep your wits about you. You can read more about the update in a blog post <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/update-24-judgement-of-the-fool-live-now">here</a>.

            <p>
Space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> has received another update jam-packed with the kind of systemic adjustments that, were you to shout them through your bedroom door at your mum, would cause her to smile shakily, then go downstairs and sob into a tea towel at the knowledge that her treasured child, her brightest and best, will never amount to anything useful, for they are too busy obsessing over ringworlds and genesis arks and xeno-compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
Mum! MUM. I've just heard that "Storm Aftermath events will no longer happen in systems where you are constructing megastructures"! Even better, "Evolutionary Predator Empires can now once more gain and keep the Psionic Ephase trait"! Christmas has come early, mum! The eagle has landed! MOTHER, LOOK AT ME. I will not be denied.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Storm Aftermath-fixing update in question, Stellaris patch 4.0.21, accompanies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502828352450592822?l=english">a cautionary note from game director Stephen "Eladrin" Muray</a>, who says that developers Paradox Interactive are planning to slow down the rate of Stellaris patching in the wake of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">4.0 update</a>, because they keep accidentally lighting whole planets on fire. It turns out the old Zuck mantra "move fast and break things" only gets you so far when you're troubleshooting galaxies.
</p>
<p>
"We've released a tremendous number of patches since then at a rapid rate - but our patch cadence has become problematic (and even counterproductive) in some ways," Muray writes. "Too often in game development, fixing one bug introduces another - and I haven't been giving our internal QA testers enough time to fully vet and test the changes we've been making. 
</p>
<p>
"Examples from recent patches include a few weeks ago when an unrelated fix to a pop issue caused Wilderness empires to seemingly randomly destroy themselves by killing all of their biomass, or when another fix just after that caused save games to corrupt and become unloadable," he goes on.
</p>
<p>
Paradox remain "committed" to patching Stellaris, which has sunk to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">a Mixed Steam user review consensus</a> following the release of the apparently cataclysmic 4.0 update, but they'll be "taking a more measured and deliberate approach to allow internal testing to catch up while giving you a more stable environment to play the game in". 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, they're shifting the emphasis to open betas that bring together QA work and player feedback more organically - the first of these will be updated "on a weekly to fortnightly basis depending on internal progress throughout the summer", with "the next 4.0.x live release" due sometime in August. Muray suggests that modders who "have been waiting for a moment of stability" take advantage of the shortage of major changes during that period.
</p>
<p>
As for what exactly they'll be patching next, please summon your mother back upstairs, for it is once again time to defeat and confuse her with the kind of preposterous sci-fantasy jargon she never ever imagined her darling baby would ever learn, back when you were just a wee tyke nuzzling at the nipple.
</p>
<p>
"I'm personally currently looking at ways to improve the AI's behavior," Muray continues. "Other things currently in active development are OOS investigations, a number of strata issues that affect slavery, purging, and other oddities among pop employment, and more of a design change rather than a bugfix - based on your feedback we're looking at having newly grown pops go straight into the Civilian stratum or its appropriate equivalent instead of being unemployed members of their parent pop group. 
</p>
<p>
"While we liked the verisimilitude of top-heavy planets having more stability issues than ones that were more evenly developed, we acknowledge that having a persistent trickle of unemployed pops feels wrong," Muray continues.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, mum? He took the words right out of my mouth. Mother, will you stop weeping and fetch me my abacus so I can calculate the performance losses from the bug "where every empire was calculating their Biomass total far too often". No, I do not want to speak to the careers advisor again. Yes, I will be eating dinner in my room this evening.
