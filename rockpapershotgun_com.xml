            <p>Ok, yep, it's one of RPS' biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>/Fallout heads, here to tell you about some New Vegas mods that've recently dropped. Why? You might ask that. You're quite right to. It's because there's a general Fallout modathon going on over on Nexus Mods right now, and I've spotted a few works released as part of it so far which I reckon are worth informing you of. Especially since next month's gearing up to be pretty damn New Vegasy, thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">a certain TV series</a>.</p>

<p>The first of these mods which have caught my eye is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94650?tab=description">Cargobots</a>, from modder Outlander3k. As you can see above, it sticks brilliantly to the established New Vegas theme of items being delivered by entities which sometimes run into peril by adding in a quest to unlock a "regional cargobot system". You're working with a Follower of the Apocalypse who seems like they'll be sending you off to scour the wastes for downed New Vegas cousins of the delivery drones which play various roles in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of new weapons to grab, and the reward for completing the quest is a remote which summons a cargobot to fly in a portable box you can store stuff in. It's far from the first time Fallout modders have gotten into providing extra means to conveniently store junk, but it's a nicely fleshed out addition to the base game's Mojave Express drop-offs.</p><p>Also linked to the courier picking up stuff as they roam the wastes is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94643">The Long Road Ahead</a> by QwibQwibMods. It adds in a set of clothing you can upgrade at different stages in your journey to reflect your character's growth and the path they've chosen in the main story. You start off by picking up your old courier clothes at Doc Mitchell's and a "Bullet Scarred Hat" from next to your grave, then find the likes of an old vest and jacket to add to this getup as you make your way to Vegas. There's a set of prototype riot armor and helmet to add to the mix once you get there, and faction trinkets around the Mojave you can use to put a visual spin on the ensemble, with all these upgrades being installed at a workbench. It's like being given the likes of the courier duster as a reward for completing the DLCs, but with a bit more personal choice and uniqueness.</p>
<p>Starting to round out this little rundown are a couple of mods which add in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92752">extra animations</a>, with one being <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94055">Taunting</a> from Intotherough, which satisfies your craving for emotes by letting you wave at or give a thumbs down to Caesar. Basically, you gesture at any NPC, and they'll react with a quick response or by getting hostile.</p>
<p>In terms of quest mods, this one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94399?tab=description">Enclave spies</a> looks like it could be fun and there's one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94431?tab=description">zombie cows</a> that looks plenty zany, though the latter appears to potentially include some some AI-generated voices. Whether that's a dealbreaker if it is the case is your call, but personally I still much prefer mods that are clear they've used either fresh human voice acting, remixed vanilla lines, or just plain text at the moment.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the works that've gone up so far in this lengthy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon">Fallout modathon</a>, which Nexus Mods are running with different weekly themes all the way up until the end of December. So, worth keeping an eye on for a month and a bit yet to see what else goes up if you're in the modding mood.</p>

            <p>Ho there, embarrassing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fans! Not had enough D&amp;D in your life lately? Pining for the Owlbears, is it? Feeling a bit shrivelled for lack of magic missiles? Baby want some Helldusk Armor? Perhaps you will be consoled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>. It's a Forgotten Realms-themed adaptation of Resolution's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, a co-op tactical RPG co-created by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> developer Mike Booth, which is itself a homage to tabletop. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>We were keen on Demeo, with Alice Bee and Edders (RPS in peace) hivemindedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demeos-pc-version-is-a-cool-trpg-hangout-that-probably-wont-get-as-many-players-as-it-deserves">deeming it</a> "a cool TRPG hangout that probably won't get as many players as it deserves". It began life as a homely ole VR game, but has since made the leap to cutting-edge flatworld display technology. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether Alice and Ed's dire predictions were born out, but I imagine the Demeo format will be automatically more interesting to a lot of you for being transplanted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icewind-dale">Icewind Dale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> Wood and Cragmaw Castle - these being among the places you'll visit in Battlemarked's two launch campaigns, with more to follow as DLC. 
</p>
<p>The game sees up to four players joining turn-based raids on craggy, grid-based maps full of traps, treasures and pugnacious figurines. Character classes include paladin, sorcerer, ranger and rogue, while enemies range from dire wolves and kobolds to giants. Going by trailers, I'm not sure it'll support the mad knock-on effects you get in the Larian game, but then again, Larian are to spell and ability combos what vultures are to the steaming corpses of recently slain paladins. There's something to be said for a party-gatherer that keeps things relatively clean.
</p><p>I enjoy the game's grabbable vinyl aesthetics, and I like how your thrown D20s physically bounce around the corridors of the map at hand. The question I have is naturally whether it'll stack up well as a solo game: you can command your whole party in skirmish mode if you're short on buds. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/">Steam</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked/7239148276178939/?click_session_id=1328337061872210">play using your ZuckerBuckets</a> if you need to lean closer to the board.</p>
