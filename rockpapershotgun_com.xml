            <p>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a>. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how <em>she's over there</em>, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First things first - the new "Special Campaign" mode is basically the shooter's equivalent of new game plus. It will let players replay the campaign (as it exists so far) "but with unique Endgame Content and Randomization," say developers Altered Orbit in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4702411539870497570">the update post</a>. It'll add random enemy encounters and give weapons ARPG style rarity colours, among other tweakable settings.</p>
<p>There were plans to call this "Randomizer" mode but it seems the devs have redesigned and rebranded it. As with classic examples of new game plus, you'll need to have already completed the game to unlock this new special mode (or, in this case, chapter one of the campaign - what exists of the game so far). </p>
<p>But more fun than this new mode, for me, are the ways the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>-like enemy patrol goons have been further improved. Like I've mentioned, they'll fall over when you throw a plate at them, but also now stumble if you blast them in the leg. They'll take increased damage when frozen by frosty grenades, and make more callouts to one another when looking for the player (for example, they will now yell about your flashlight giving you away). </p>

<p>There's a miscellany of other improvements, such as snappier Halo-style melee attacks, and a bunch of balancing to various firearms. There are also many bug fixes. "Throwing toilets against enemies no longer crashes the game," we're told. "Fixed a rare bug where enemies killed by electricity would instead become invincible." God, I love patch notes.</p><p>As for the noise - there's more of that too. "Improved oomph for Fire Extinguisher explosions," yell the patch notes enthusiastically. "Improved sound effect when walking over glass," another note screams. "Went nuts on the audio design for bullet impacts and whizzes," a third note whispers, but with a manic and delighted look that implies there is a landmine nearby. Don't worry, the mine's explosive radius has been nerfed by almost 50%. You'll be fine.</p>
<p>It's a fairly hefty update, which the developer cites as the reason for a delay in the story stuff that was planned to get players closer to their protagonist. Narrative additions they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noisy-shooter-selaco-is-steam-deck-verified-with-new-story-stuff-ai-improvements-and-randomizer-modes-in-the-works">previously mentioned</a> include "a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot". That was planned for the end of this year, but it's been pushed back a couple months to January or February next year, say the devs. In the meantime, work on the second chapter of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> "continues to progress rapidly," they say, dropping hints of deployable turrets, miniguns, and... is that a mech suit? Interesting.</p>

<p>If Selaco's many additions and alterations are sometimes difficult to follow, it's partly because the devs don't use a roadmap like other studios might during early access. "Roadmaps tend to have a negative effect on development/work," they've <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791469846912&amp;emgid=4374768959778727710">said in the past</a>. "Experimentation with new ideas takes time, while roadmaps are schedule-focused and don't allow for such things."</p><p>However they're doing things, it seems to be working just fine. Ed liked Selaco when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">reviewed the first early access build</a>, calling it a work of impressive "GZDoom wizardry" and praising those cunning AI enemies. Here's what he had to say about the running and/or gunning.</p>
<blockquote>Firefights are a festival of debris, where it rains printer paper and computer monitors crackle and alien troops coat everything in a sticky purple gunk when you explode them. While the result of your bullets can be quite chaotic, gunfights straddle the line between tactical and balls-to-the-wall boomer shooter really well...</blockquote>
<p>It's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">discounted in Steam's Autumn sale</a>, if you like a bit of noise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh has announced Dreams On A Pillow, a mixture of stealth-adventure and interactive documentary set during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba">Nakba</a> - Israel's violent displacement and dispossession of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, shortly after Israel's founding. Created by "a global team of veteran game developers", it's the story of a Palestinian woman grappling with the loss of her baby after fleeing a bloody assault on her town. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Here's a description of the game, via press release.
</p>
<blockquote>"Dreams on a Pillow is a pseudo-3D Stealth-Adventure game based on the true Palestinian folktale of Omm - a Palestinian mother who fled the massacre of her town with her new-born child. After running for an hour in sheer panic, she realized that she had carried a pillow to safety, instead of her child. Inspired by the story, Dreams on a Pillow explores Omm's life story, showcasing both the history of Palestine before the ethnic cleansing of the lands, and the trauma borne from the violence that was inflicted upon the Palestinian people during the Nakba."</blockquote>

<p>
According to the announcement materials, Omm's journey as a refugee takes her through the sites of several atrocities, including concentration camps and attacks on Palestinians near the Lebanese border. Whenever she is able to rest, the game switches into a documentary mode, "reliving a rapidly fading memory of a pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">Zionist</a> Palestine" by means of archive imagery and text. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/2_L9jSxaj.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Omm's principle possession is the pillow, which serves as both a terrible reminder of her lost child and a kind of coping device. When carrying it, she's not able to interact with objects or do things like jump, crawl, throw rocks and climb ladders. Putting the pillow down, however, triggers Omm's guilt and trauma, provoking nightmares that "reveal dangers of the mind, and shroud the dangers of the real world". The immediate practical challenge during the stealth-adventure sections, then, is to complete whatever objectives are at hand and retrieve the pillow before Omm's delusions overwhelm her.
</p><p>
Abueideh is the developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liyla_and_the_Shadows_of_War">Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War</a>, a freeware game released for PC and mobile in 2016, which follows a Palestinian family's struggle to survive during Israel's 2014 war on the Palestinian territory of Gaza. The game <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/liyla-shadows-war-game-gaza-strip-palestine-israel/">drew headlines</a> when Apple initially refused to list it in the Games section of the Apple Store, requesting that it be categorised under "News" or "Reference" instead. They reversed their decision a week later following an outcry and accusations of double standards with regard to games about or by Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>
While Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War has won or been nominated for several awards, Abueideh says he has struggled to make headway in the industry ever since, something he attributes to publisher wariness of the politically sensitive subject of Israel's long-running occupation of Palestinian territories. He says it has proven "impossible" to find a traditional publisher for Dreams On A Pillow, nor has he been able to muster the funds independently. After releasing Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War, Abueideh opened a nut roastery in his home town of Nablus in the Palestinian West Bank, but he says it's now unsafe to visit the building due to the nearby activity of Israeli colonists. 
</p>
<p>
As such, Abueideh is <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">crowd-funding the game via the LaunchGood platform</a>. He says he's using LaunchGood, which focuses specifically on projects from Muslim people, "because most popular crowdfunding platforms do not recognize Palestine".
</p>
<p>
The announcement of Dreams On A Pillow comes in the middle of open warfare between the Israeli armed forces and Hamas, the government of Gaza. The current conflict began in October 2023, when Hamas struck across the border and killed over a thousand people, while taking 251 people hostage. Since then, Israel has carried out a ground invasion and bombing campaign that has killed well over 40,000 Gazans and injured or displaced hundreds of thousands more. 
</p><p>
In the process, Israel has <a href="https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2024/01/widescale-destruction-of-cultural-heritage-in-gaza/">destroyed</a> many Palestinian cultural institutions and sites, including universities, libraries and museums. While set many decades before, Dreams On A Pillow is an assertion of Palestinian heritage and rights in response to this on-going erasure. It aims to shore up connections between present bloodshed and the violence of the Nakba, while rebutting what the LaunchGood page terms "the common propaganda myth" of Palestine as a "land without people" prior to Israel's founding.
