            <p>If you've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, your broomstick's going to have to stay grounded for a little bit longer. Developers Chucklefish have opted to push the cosy magic schooler's release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/magic-school-stardew-like-witchbrook-gets-its-first-proper-trailer">this winter</a> to 2026. At the same time, they've put out an interactive map offering the first proper look at its setting, Mossport.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">blog post</a> seemingly penned by a pair of socks said the "difficult decision" to delay has been made "despite great development progress this year". "Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail," they continued. "In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive."</p>
<p>Further on in the post, pushing back the date's also teased to have "opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support", with more info on those promised soon.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there's the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive map</a>, which you can open up and click around to get an idea of the distances you'll have to run (or fly on a broomstick, per the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">wishes of Alice B</a>) between the spring festival and Shadhollow Forest. Or how feasible a post-class trip to the Parasol Sands beach will be.</p><p>If it is, maybe you can use magic to overcome that issue. After all, what's the point in living with the stuff if you can't use it to get rid of life annoying's quirks, such as the need to use your legs. Then, you can chop off your legs and lob them in some potion which grants you uber-fast spectral legs. You could also hope that the entire map's on the slope of a hill, so you can hop in your cauldron and roll from place to place like a sentient boulder.</p>
<p>You've now got a bit more time to choose between all of those options, some of which probably won't be in the actual game. The cauldron rolling better be there though.</p>
