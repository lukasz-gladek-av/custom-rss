            <p>The GeForce RTX 50 series – Nvidia’s hated, adored, but never ignored family of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">gaming GPUs</a> – could soon be complete, as the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti have been specced out ahead of their imminent releases. These are mostly as-expected replacements for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-review">RTX 4060 Ti</a>, with moderate performance bumps augmented by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a>, though the RTX 5060 Ti is getting a lowered MSRP on both its 8GB and 16GB variants.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While there won't be a Founders Edition for any of these, partner versions of the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti will start from £349 / $379 - £40 / $20 less than the 8GB 4060 Ti. Base-price 16GB models, meanwhile, will shed £80 / $70 from the last-gen equivalent, selling at £399 / $429. Both are officially launching this Wednesday, April 16th, though an Nvidia spokesperson told digitally gathered reporters last week (myself included) that a lot of 8GB RTX 5060 Ti models might not actually go on sale until later on.</p>
<p>As for the RTX 5060, that’s sticking solely to 8GB, and will start at $299 (UK pricing TBC) when it has its own as-yet-unspecified release in May. The lack of extra VRAM over the RTX 4060 will likely keep it limited to 1080p duties, though that’s evidently not been a problem for the latter, which currently sits second on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam’s list of the most-used graphics cards</a>. Only after, funnily enough, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">RTX 3060</a>. It does use newer GDDR7 memory, though, as does the RTX 5060 Ti.</p>

<p>Here be some Nvidia-provided benchmark graphs to peer over, and yes, you <em>can</em> click to make them human eye-sized. Predictably, they count MFG’s AI-generated frames in amongst the traditionally rendered ones, which trickifies the business of making core performance comparisons against previous generations. Except, that is, in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>, which lacks MFG support and is thus comparable with the RTX 4060’s lowly 2x frame gen. Nvidia, you fools! Now it’s laid bare that, uh, both 5060 GPUs are about 20% faster over their 4060 counterparts, which doesn’t sound all that bad. Especially right after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">RTX 5070</a>, which is essentially just an RTX 4070 Super <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaOgZwk9rN8">with a new hat</a>.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/RTX-5060-official-benchmarks.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>Frame generation remains as contentious a subject as the RTX 50 range itself, and to be honest, I’m still not sure how it’s perceived and used by the majority of ordinary players. Maybe you’d like to answer the poll below and educate me on that point. I will say that all frame gen systems – MFG, DLSS 3, FSR, the lot – work best when your PC is already churning out a healthy supply of ordinary frames, so cheaper GPUs like the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti might not be able to rely on them as much as a hulking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>. Here’s hoping the pre-generation framerate boost over the RTX 40 series is real, though obviously we have but the one rat-dodging stealth game for data points.</p>
<p>It's also unclear whether those (otherwise very agreeable) RTX 5060 Ti price drops will actually hold. Most of the previous RTX 50 GPU launches have been marred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5070-founders-editions-will-be-a-few-weeks-late-as-punters-and-sellers-brace-for-launch-day-shortages">stock shortages and resultant gouging</a>, and as the most mainstream-friendly of the pack, the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti seem especially vulnerable to instant sellouts. It's also too early to judge the impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-us-tariffs-hit-pc-hardware-is-joining-the-switch-2-in-pre-order-delay-limbo">US tariffs</a>: these were mostly paused/rolled back/wussed out of last week, though a base 10% tax remains, and Nvidia’s Taiwan-made GPUs aren’t counted among exemptions. Guess those <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2025/04/09/nvidia_us_export_ban_change/">$1m Mar-a-Lago dinners</a> only go so far.</p>

Images of what looks very much like that long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remake or remaster have leaked online care of Virtuos Games, the Singapore-based game developer reported to be handling the project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The pics were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">dug up</a> by enterprising Redditor Taurnil, who inspected a random element on <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/">the Virtuos Games website</a>, and wangled his way to a Wordpress folder containing a bunch of images labelled “Elder Scrolls IV” and “Oblivion”, which were uploaded just today (15th April). 
</p>
<p>
I’ve been able to retrace Taurnil’s steps and access said folder. It appears somebody has Virtuos has spotted the leak, because the images in question are no longer accessible, but the filenames are still there at the time of writing. I’ve asked Virtuos for comment.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, somebody else claims to have uploaded a few images to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a> – that's one of them up there in my article header. While they seem pretty credible, there is just the daintiest smidgeon of a ghostly possibility that they’ve been faked and posted for the lulz, so handle with caution. They show a few locations, including the Imperial City at Cyrodiil and a flaming Oblivion gate, together with a formal title, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.
</p>
<p>Is this just a remaster, then, or more of a remake? Earlier rumours have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">suggested</a> that the new version of Oblivion will make fairly robust changes to the original 2006 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking systems. Assuming all of this is legit, it doesn't sound like they've just bumped up the resolution.</p>
<p>
Oblivion remake gossip is currently at fever pitch, alleviated not at all by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">a chancy-sounding Bethesda support statement that “we have no official information on an Oblivion remake”</a>. If I were Bethesda and had an announcement trailer in the offing, I’d probably think about running it early at this stage.

For years now I have watched Haenir's putrid action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blight-survival">Blight: Survival</a> like a miasmatic knight errant squinting through the bushes at a peasant-shaped mushroom. I reached out to the devs for an interview a while ago, and received no reply. I wasn't hugely surprised by their silence: Blight began life as a two-person project, and is a long way from release. Still, there's been some ominous movement of late: the developers have unveiled a new biome and enemies, and are now fielding applications for very limited closed playtesting.

<p>
In Blight: Survival, you and up to three chums roam a squelching hinterland between two warring kingdoms. The conflict has bred a noxious brainrot that has reduced the resident villagers to sporing undead. There are also enemy soldiers to worry about, busily farming the wreckage. You're a graverobber yourself, siphoning gear from the battlefield by means of "mechanics inspired from rogue-lites and extraction games". Your higher goal is to reach and obliterate the source of the Blight. I'd have thought persuading the opposing kingdoms to stop spilling blood everywhere would have been the place to start, but this is a video game.
</p>

<p>
I will not say that Blight looks like High Art. I will not say that it courts thematic complexity. It is about hiking through the flyblown boondocks, murdering reanimated shepherds with a longsword. I don't get the sense that any particular commentary on any particular war is being offered. Still, within its stinking parameters, it ticks a number of boxes for me. Firstly, "directional combat", with players angling their sword to swing or parry. Directional combat is often horribly implemented, or treated as a source of comedy, but it worked in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> and it mostly works in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and I'm always drawn to the concept, because I like to feel like I'm literally hefting a sharpened metal stick. To get a sense of it, check out the reveal trailer from 2022.

<p>
Secondly, Blight has some appreciably nasty swamp environments, full of chopped chapels and gibbet trees. It makes me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, but there's some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> here and probably some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as well. I enjoy when games commit to being a swamp level, inasmuch as this is purposefully and viciously alienating a section of your audience in advance. I'm hoping the landscapes will be as enveloping as they seem, with plenty of opportunities to get lost. "Will you go back and secure your spoils or risk it all and push forward?" offers the Steam page. "How far are you willing to go?" That very much depends on whether I've got dinner on, Haenir. When I'm playing an extraction-style game the critical factor is whether the average round lasts longer than it would take a pot of pasta to cook.
</p>
<p>
Haenir's puny ranks have recently been swollen by "several dozen full-time developers" from publisher Behaviour Interactive, including "level designers, narrative writers, programmers, UI/UX devs, concept and VFX artists, animators, sound designers, QA testers, directors, producers, and more". I'm a bit leery of Behaviour, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">recent mass layoffs and closures</a>, but Blight's sweaty skirmishing feels like a decent fit for the creators of Dead by Daylight. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774880/view/545603039390598280?l=english">Read more in the latest Steam blog post, including details about the forthcoming playtests</a>. Release date as yet the game hath none.
