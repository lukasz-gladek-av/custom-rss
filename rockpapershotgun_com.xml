I fondly cherish my many memories of claustrophobia, confusion and terror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>. I can't get enough of the experience of being lodged behind the furniture like some teenager's hurriedly hidden copy of Loaded (or whatever the kids are reading now), rifle pivoting wildly between barricaded doors and windows, as enemy players bustle around the roof like awful, C4-toting pigeons.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I do feel the urge for some kind of proper, real-time tactical overview. Don't we have drones for that, Mr Clancy? As such, I'm moderately pleased to hear that Ubisoft are working on a top-down turn-based game set in the Rainbow Six universe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The rumour in question comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, who appear to have access to a whole wardrobe full of Ubisoft's dirty laundry, and are now skulking inside that wardrobe with a shotgun. The project is allegedly one or two years from release. As it stands, it's said to play a lot like XCOM, but with fixtures and a "loop" borrowed from Siege: you'll pick operators based on their skills to raid buildings and save hostages, all the Clancy favourites. It's said to last approximately 25-30 hours. The report has been corroborated by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, who adds in <a href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/the-switch-2-is-having-an-xbox-moment">the latest Dead Game newsletter</a> that the project is codenamed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slice-and-dice">Slice &amp; Dice</a> and is led by Elie Benhamou, the game director for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
The estimable Rock Paper Shotgun verdict on Breakpoint was that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-ghost-recon-breakpoint">broadly sucked arse</a>, despite a meticulously-woven open world. The rumoured "Slice &amp; Dice" concept seems promising, however, particularly if it can incorporate all the tricky things Siege players do with destructible surfaces. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the reports are legit, I imagine the major worry for the project's developers right now is the potential impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's carving out of a new Tencent-backed subsidiary for their most profitable games</a> - that's Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for a proper, top-down tactical overview of how this subsidiary will be run: the deal covers studios in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, but the number of individual developers involved remains to be determined. It's also not clear how developers might move back and forth between the new subsidiary and the rest of Ubisoft: Siege's development is led by Ubisoft Montreal, but features contributions from teams based in Toronto, Kyiv, Shanghai and Chengdu.

            <p>
Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani has criticised other games industry executives for letting rank-and-file developers take the fall for what he styles "very unsound business decisions" over the past two years.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
An extremely compressed recap: tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs across companies like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">Embracer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-announce-900-layoffs-across-naughty-dog-guerilla-insomniac-and-playstation-studios-worldwide">PlayStation</a> in the past year alone, as the industry's beefiest operators <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">struggle to meet the expectations of investors and repay debts</a> following a period of expansion kindled by a gaming boom during the worldwide Covid pandemic lockdowns. Much-hyped, functionally bogus new technologies such as NFTs, cryptocurrency and generative AI have yet to fill the hole, so costs are being cut instead.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is one of last year's big success stories, despite not having much buzz around it before launch. For all that, and despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-helldivers-2-was-at-its-lowest-arrowhead-looked-to-hello-games-and-no-mans-sky-to-keep-their-chin-up">very public difficulty keeping up with an unexpectedly large audience</a>, Jorjani says he's not interested in significant studio expansion. "I want us to be a role model for how to do sustainable growth, because the industry today is not in a good place," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a> (HELLO DRINGO) in an interview last week. 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of companies are shedding a lot of jobs. And it's not the people at the top that are losing their jobs, it's people who have moved half across the world to take jobs. And that's because of bad growth decisions made by business leaders who have taken stupid risks."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had more vitriol to share elsewhere in the chat.  "I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost... 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," he said. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?
</p>
<p>
"What's happening is that regular developers, are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry. Just because you can hire and triple in size in six months, doesn't mean you should. Or that it's the best thing for the studio's long term business health.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not saying don't grow, but do it in a way where you don't have to then let go of one third of the company because you made stupid decisions. I'm not going to hire a hundred people., I would like to do that and help people in the industry, but my first priority is to make sure that people have jobs for many years." 
</p>
<p>I've written up a bunch of stories about industry layoffs, rich with rhetoric about not taking decisions "lightly" and "aligning" for success. It's rare that the executives quoted in those announcements fall on their swords, or even lightly graze themselves with their swords in the form of some reduced annual compensation. The only caveat I will offer is that executive pay structures can be rather byzantine: many are paid partly in stock, and so have their incomes tethered directly to the company's performance. Still, I doubt the majority are worried about paying their rent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
