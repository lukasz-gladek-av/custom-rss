            <p>
Earlier this year, the reveal of Sloclap’s Rematch sent me into spirals of introspection about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creators-of-sifu-and-absolver-are-making-a-football-game-set-many-decades-from-now">the classist origins of my apathy for football</a>. Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is sending me into spirals of introspection about the fact that maybe football was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> all along. Hypersonic penalty kicks that wreathe the ball in purple fire? Nobody told me football was this rad. So many years wasted, playing effing grass hockey.
</p>
<p>
Created by Level5 Inc – the studio behind such classics as Dragon Quest 8, the Professor Layton series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered">Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</a>, together with the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, it’s a blend of open-ended school yarn and fantasy soccer with 5,400 characters to recruit.</p>
<p>There have been a few of these Inazuma Eleven games, it turns out, but this is the first mainline entry in 12 years, and the first time they’ve released one for PC. It seems smashing. Smashing! I don’t care that I sound like somebody out of the Beano. I don't care that the centre-forwards all sprint like they're battling to restrain the aftermath of a hastily eaten curry. I watched the trailer below and the score brought wholly non-curry-related tears to my eyes.

SMASHING. Let’s proceed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=4777282">the Steam page</a> without further ado. Dear lord, it’s a tawdry logjam of special edition bonuses and bolt-on preorder tat. I read <a href="https://indiegamejoe.com/steam-store-page-optimization-above-the-fold-best-practices/">a blog post about how to structure a Steam page</a> earlier and this pretty much breaks every rule on it. Keep scrolling, however, and you’ll eventually discover the game's premise. 
</p><p>
“This new story takes place 25 years after the first Inazuma Eleven,” the developers explain. “In search of a world without football, protagonist Destin Billows enrolls at South Cirrus Junior High. Meanwhile, within the prestigious Raimon Junior High - renowned as the top team in the nationals - rises a Football Monster named Harper Evans. When these two cross paths, a tale begins to unfold…” The story sequences include animations supplied by MAPPA, producers of such anime films and adaptations as Dorohedoro, Chainsaw Man and Zombie Land Saga.
</p>
<p>
I can’t bring you any hands-on Victory Road impressions, sadly, as we’ve only just been offered code, and I’m worried the code offering person is a phisher. But there is much enthusiasm in the Steam forums, with the caveat that a lot of it is from advanced access buyers who are perhaps dabbling in a little sunk cost fallacy.

            <p>Over 200 staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar North have signed a letter to management calling for the "immediate reinstatement" of 31 workers fired recently by the company. Rockstar claimed they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired these staffers for "gross misconduct"</a>, subsequently accusing them of sharing confidential info publicly. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The union have also held protests outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two's UK offices</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/rockstar-open-letter-13-11-25/">according to the IWGB</a>, a letter signed by 220 staff at Edinburgh-based Rockstar North has been delivered to the studio's management. The letter calls for the "immediate reinstatement" of the fired workers, and condemns the decision to boot them out of their jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>"It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Meanwhile, IWGB organiser Fred Carter called the firings an "Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry". More union protests against Rockstar are planned in the very near future, with an 8AM rally outside Take Two’s London office and a 4PM CET protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters - the latter staged by the French STJV (Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo) union - set to take place on November 14th. There's also a protest set to take place at 6PM on November 18th outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, timed to coincide with a cross-party parliamentary group meeting about the Scottish games industry.</p>
<p>GTA 6 remains a spectre now lurking on November 19th, 2026, following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">most recent delay</a> around the time news of the firings broke.</p>
