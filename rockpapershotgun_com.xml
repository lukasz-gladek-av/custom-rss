            <p>Around a week ago, <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804">146,000 people mourned the death of a horse they'd never met</a>. This might be the best single thing that has ever happened in videogames, although I don't imagine the horse would give a shit. Grass Wonder was a famous Japanese racehorse, but it's likely the majority  of those that mourned his death online are only fans of Japanese horse racing by proxy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/champion-grass-wonder-the-grandsire-of-maurice-dies-at-30">Here is an article about Grass Wonder's death</a> that does not mention <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> once. I find this profound and comforting, in the sense that it feels miraculous that such intertwined cultural spheres can still exist in their own siloes. There are people who knew Grass Wonder well, yet would look at you playing the anime horse girl game in wordless confusion, save a muttered directive that you seek the love and light of a forgiving god.</p>
<p>I'm not going to eulogise Grass Wonder because I do not care about Grass Wonder any more than I care about any other horse, and don't especially feel like pretending I do just for the sake of a bit. I think all horses are pretty good but I cannot eulogise them all. But Grass Wonder <em>is </em>special is the sense that Grass Wonder is the horse I'm currently thinking about. Grass Wonder is, as far as I'm concerned, the most famous horse in the world right now. He tramples with disdain over the frail, fallen forms of lesser attention economy aspirants, and from beyond the grave no less.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Again, we can tell from that social post linked above that Pretty Derby has inspired at least 146,000 people that I imagine would not have otherwise known about the existence, never mind death, of Grass Wonder, to spend at least some time this month thinking about his passing. I have not played <a href="https://umamusume.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Wonder">the horse girl game</a>. Perhaps it has the power to repair my relationship with my own soul, although I'm sceptical. But today, at least, it has conjured for me a reminder that fate has both a sense of humour and a penchant for Gacha mechanics. If the universe is, indeed, a machine for producing ever more potent instances of novelty, it did a fine job with the cultural impact of this racehorse's fatal organ failure.</p><p>According to the article linked above, Grass Wonder "sired 736 winners from 1327 foals". If someone in the comments could enlighten me to whether this is a misprint I would be grateful. Grass Wonder has been breeding for 25 years. If we assume the above to be true, that's about 53 kids a year, or one a week. Goliath-felling levels of mythical dick slinging, that. A real legacy, although Grass Wonder's impact on me will remain the still very notable achievement of making me think about horse dick while writing about videogames. This basically never happens. Oh, maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, actually. Weird that it happened twice, etc.</p>

            <p>Hey, Agent 47. That's a really nice scarf. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is getting written about a lot these days so I'm seeing quite a few screenshots of buildings being blown up. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to have developed a visceral distaste for images of buildings being blown up recently. At times like these, it's nice to look at a nice scarf.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It feels grandiose and a little paranoid to relate those images of bombed-out structures to part of a larger cultural project of desensitisation, although I'm not <em>not </em>struck temporarily mute and reeling and a touch nauseous at the moment we find ourselves in, in which art about love is reframed as pornography, too vile to touch, and in which art that conjures and celebrates reminders of contemporary global suffering fades so routinely into the normal order of things. More than normal. Hot property. Hot like chapped dehydrated lips under a cruel sun. Hot like fire from the sky.</p>
<p>So, as I say, it's nice just to see a lovely scarf. Helps take the mind off things, you know?</p>
<p>I can see that you're enjoying that scarf, too, Agent 47. Don't lose focus, though. You almost missed that security camera!</p>

<p>You have to take out the cameras first, 47. It's just good business, taking out the cameras, right before you do something too vile for words. Oh, right. News. Yes. IO Interactive recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7356956984207630336">hired a new writer on World Of Asssasination</a> in former Edge editor Jen Simpkins, which likely means we'll be getting more substantial updates that I'd previously assumed, lining up with IO's promises that Hitman isn't completely wrapped up as they move on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>. This is a videogame news piece on a videogame website. You can't say it isn't.</p>
