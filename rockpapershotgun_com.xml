            <p>The rough beast that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has cracked its shell and slouched towards the wincing light of day. They've released it, I mean. No verdict from us yet: our reviewer is still picking their way among the exploding motorbikes and mocking spectres of deceased Nicaraguan terrorists. But I can at least tell you with some confidence that if you're a fan of pausing games or mid-mission checkpoints, you might want to give it a miss.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">Eurogamer</a>, neither pausing, nor mission checkpoints, nor playing the game offline are allowed in the new Blops, thanks in part to its heavy focus on four player co-op play. You cannot look away from Blops anymore: it has become the Eye of Sauron, transfixing you from across the coffee table as it zooms to flaming close-up. Your time belongs to the cod! It sleeps with the fishes. Damn, I could see a mafia-themed Call of Duty set in Mordor, actually. It doesn't sound like it would be wholly out of synch with the endgame, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-basically-gun-speed-dating-and-its-endgame-is-a-big-fight-in-map-soup">entangles maps from Blopses gone by</a>. Collage Of Duty, they definitely aren't calling it.</p>
<p>This isn't the first Call Of Duty campaign to be always-online. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-missed-that-the-black-ops-6-campaign-is-always-online-but-fortunately-its-not-too-late-to-throw-a-wobbly">Black Ops 6 went there too</a>, and that game sold like hot yellowcake uranium, so clearly a significant proportion of you aren't fussed. Still, no mission checkpoints?</p>
<p>There are other and more pressing reasons to no-sell the new Call Of Duty. It's being published by Microsoft, who like buying studios for billions and then laying loads of people off, and who continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">do business</a> (despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">individual divestments</a>) with armies who have participated in what the UN has formally termed a genocide. We did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">a big report</a> on protests against the company's Israeli military connections earlier in the year.</p>

            <p>Remember Brendan from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? If the answer's no, I don't blame you. He's a talking vending machine you can run into and end up going off on a short series of side quests about, but I totally missed him in my fist couple of playthroughs. Anyway, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, but that quest arc in the base game ends pretty tragically, something a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">modder</a>'s now changed via the addition of an extra bit which lets you pay to have the semi-sentient snack box installed in V's flat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Cyberpunk modder Deceptious is behind this short extra mission, which they've dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25629?tab=description">Brendan's Death Song</a>' in honour of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song I can't admit often makes it into my playlists. I'm more of a basic Californicationy kinda bloke, what can I say?</p>
<p>With this work installed, after running into Brendan the vending machine outside of Megabuilding H8 in Japantown and running through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/I_Can_See_Clearly_Now">trio of quests</a> involving him, things usually end with him telling a final gag before undergoing a programming change that'll get rid of his chatty quirkiness. Think the ending of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, except Roy Batty's spent his life giving out more free snacks than he should have.</p>
<p>But, what if Harrison Ford could have paid some dudes to pick up Roy Batty, bring him back to life, and install him in the wall of Deckard's flat? Sounds pretty horrifying to be honest, but it's probably a lot less horrifying when this mod does it as a way of letting you keep a bit of Brendan in your cyber-life. Once the machine's been added to the default Megabuilding H10 apartment via a quest heavy on text messages, he'll be available for some brief conversation and occasionally dish out a free drink.</p>
<p>"He goes silent during partner dates in H10, but does have a small change of appearance when the partner is there," Deceptious teases, in case you were worried about being virtually cockblocked by a coin-operated flatmate.</p>
<p>To get the mod up and running, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious' Quest Core</a>, plus standard Cyberpunk advanced tweak enablers <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>. Oh, and a tolerance for groan-worthy gags. Let's face it though, if you saw the headline of this article with my name in the byline and have read this far, you've almost certainly got that. Or you just like hearing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">intriguing Cyberpunk mods</a>.</p>
