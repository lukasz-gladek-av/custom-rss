            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> is finally emerging from an early access period that will have lasted nearly a decade, when its full release on November 15th rolls around, and you'll soon be able to grab it on Steam.</p>
<p>Yep, it's taken yeaaaaarrrssss. Tarkov's initial alpha release came on August 4th, 2016, just a few days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> arrived for the first time, and just after a little game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> dropped. Think about what you were doing back then. I was a teenager, still far from the job-having husk I've since morphed into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, old feeling aside, Tarkov's Steam page looks like it'll drop any day now, after Battlestate Games studio head Nikita Buyanov decided to tweet some things. First there was a <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1961830502928724363">gif of an old bloke</a> holding a steaming iron on August 30th, which everyone took as a tease rather than an endorsement for getting the creases out of your favourite top from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> developerman. Said FPS developerman was also, er, rather forthright in his reply to someone who responded to that post with accusations of scamming.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, Buyanov dispensed with the pagentry. "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later," he posted, alongside a picture of said Steam page that'd be easier to dissect if it didn't have a great big Steam logo slapped on top of it. You know, just in case you don't know what a Steam page looks like, or had missed him saying that's where Tarkov's heading.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>Will existing players who want to switch to Steam have to buy it again and start from scratch? That's what folks in Buyanov's replies wondered, and he doesn't look to have provided an answer. Don't worry, I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-escape-from-tarkov-pve-mode-exclusive-to-pricey-unheard-edition-despite-promises-of-free-dlc">everything'll work out ok</a>.</p>
<p>If it's been a while since you've escaped to Tarkov, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-is-offering-players-in-game-currency-as-a-bounty-for-reporting-cheaters">cheaters</a> have remained an issue in it over recent years, but it's still on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">our top survival games list</a>. Also here's an excerpt from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-has-sent-me-on-a-long-quest-for-some-toilet-roll">an article</a> about Craig Pearson hunting down some toilet roll in it:</p>
<blockquote>I stalked the corridors, cracking doors and checking rooms, closing them as I went, because I was taught to be respectful even during an apocalypse. I found piles of crap and burnt-out detritus, but no loo roll. When I discovered a body pile on the roof it was full of worthless military doodads. This is a world with more shotguns than sponge soft shitter sheets.</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping he's located some loo paper in the years since 2020.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> will get at least one more significant game update, says Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, mere months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eric-barone-the-guy-who-cant-stop-updating-stardew-valley-says-the-words-i-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2">stating</a> that he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy." It'll be called update 1.7, and the trimness of the numbering implies that it'll be a large one. For context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">Stardew Valley update 1.6</a> brought eight player PC co-op, new crops, a lot more NPC dialogue, a mastery system, new pets, and the ability to give those pets hats (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-putting-hats-on-your-pets-asks-stardew-valley-creator">caused a few problems</a>). 
</p>
<p>"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">wrote on Xitter</a> over the weekend. "No release date, no estimate. But it's happening."

</p><p>Barone is theoretically also working on a brand new game, the more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">combat-focussed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, but Stardew Valley keeps luring him back, for there is always something else to fix or introduce, however daft. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," he said in May. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas." 
</p>
<p>In Barone's defence, if I had made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games">fourth best-selling premium PC game of all time</a>, I would feel in no great rush to move on from it. I would tinker for years. Well, I mean, I would actually take a lot of holidays. But in between all those trips to Alton Towers and when not playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> in my bedroom-sized caramel fondue, I would do plenty of tinkering. Ah, I imagine George R. R. Martin wishes he could be updating the old GOT novels instead of writing The Winds Of Winter.

            <p>Team Cherry have confirmed release times and price points for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. It'll cost $19.99, €19.99 and ¥2300 at launch on Thursday 4th September, with pricing for other regions such as the UK to follow. As an indication, the above pricepoints equate to around £17, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged £19.99 for it, purely for the sake of symmetry.
</p>
<p>It's traditional among games journalists to illustrate pricepoints in terms of high street chain cups of coffee. But this is Silksong, a game anticipated as fervently as the ancient Mayans once anticipated the coming of an eclipse, so I will resort to more ornate means of comparison: Silksong will cost you 4200000th as much as a B-52 Stratofortress. It will cost you three-sixteenths of your soul on a rainy Friday, or two-sixteenths if the sun is out. It will cost you considerably less than they could probably charge for it. I'm not saying we should be grateful, mind, but we can breathe a sigh of a relief that this isn't being published by EA, Take-Two or Microsoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The game will launch on 7am PT, 10am ET, 3pm BST, and 4pm CEST this Thursday. This means that North American players can take the whole day off so as to rise and shove their gloating faces into Hornet's adventure, very first thing. You won't even have to shower first, you bastards. Seething Brits and Europeans must twiddle their thumbs in apoplexy till mid-afternoon, while the poor, sleepless Japanese seemingly won't get access till 11pm Tokyo time, if I'm converting the timezones correctly.
</p>
<p>James was recently able to actually play Silksong at Gamescom, finding it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">both enjoyable and familiar</a>. "The upside of playing it safe is that absolutely nothing has compromised what made the first game's action a tactile pleasure: its abnormally fine-tuned controls and pin-sharp audio/visual feedback on hits and jumps," James wrote.
</p><p>We had a bit of a ride with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Back in 2017, John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-review">recommended that people play Ori and the Blind Forest</a> instead. This caused quite the hullabaloo over the subsequent eight years. My sage and considered verdict in hindsight is that they're both mid and you should play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>. Here's to another eight years!</p>
