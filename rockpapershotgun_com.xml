            <p>Two theme parks are being planned based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>. Mojang are partnering with Merlin Entertainments to open the destinations, including rides, hotel rooms and shops, in the UK and US in 2026 and 2027. Merlin are the operator of existing theme parks and attractions including Alton Towers, Legoland, Sea Life, and Madame Tussauds.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Minecraft parks will be opened as part of an existing theme park or as new city centre attractions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/minecraft-theme-park-deal-uk-us-merlin-entertainments">according to The Guardian</a>. Mojang and Merlin also have plans to expand to other countries and territories.
</p>
<p>These attractions won't be the first time Mincraft has crossed in the real world. Earlier this year, Mojang partnered with Supply + Demand to launch <a href="https://www.minecraftexperience.com/">Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue</a>, an "immersive, interactive Minecraft quest" in Plano, Texas. The partnership with Merlin seems an order of magnitude more ambitious, however.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is shaping up to have a busy few years, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">a live action movie on the way</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">a Netflix animated series. It could also be a big few years for UK theme parks, with </a><a href="https://universalukproject.co.uk/">Universal planning a potential park as well</a>.
</p><p>The biggest news for Minecraft is obviously that we just named it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game ever</a>. Yes, I will be taking my son to the Minecraft theme park, even if it just turns out to be a shed full of cardboard boxes. I can't resist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-might-be-moving-closer-to-a-steam-controller-2-and-new-vr-controllers-rumours-say<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>Based on anonymous sources and datamining</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Valve said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-want-to-make-another-steam-controller-happen">that they want to make a new Steam Controller</a> back in 2022, but such a thing might be getting closer to production, according to dataminer Brad Lynch.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Codename for Steam Controller 2 is 'Ibex'. Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)," Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316">tweeted</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>. "Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization".
</p>
<p>Deckard is reportedly the codename for a standalone VR headset from Valve. They have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">occasional and dull patent filings</a> in recent years that could be for such a headset. The "Roy" controllers are reportedly new motion controls designed for use with the new VR headset.
</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182">tweet</a>, Lynch says that the Roy controllers will "have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap".
</p>
<p>"I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named," Lynch writes.
</p>
<p>None of this is hard proof that any of this is actually happening. Valve have not announced any new hardware, other than last week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">limited edition white Steam Deck</a>. 
</p>
<p>It's possible I'm just posting this because I want it to be true. I've been using a Valve Index for four years and I've started to long for something with higher resolution screens. I can't bring myself to buy a Meta product, however, so I'm really hoping Valve eventually deliver.
</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is less immediately appealing, but I'd still be curious to see Valve take another swing at any of their past hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is making changes to how it handles mods in order to address server stability issues. Come the next big update in December, mods "will be prohibited from public online sessions," according to an update from the game director.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We wanted to make a game that was moddable from the start (this is why our game pack files are not encrypted, for example). It's always a pleasure for me, as a developer, to see what our community can create. Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity," writes Dmitriy Grigorenko <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director">on the Focus Home Interactive forums</a> (also shared <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957">on Steam</a>).
</p>
<p>"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players. Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.
</p>
<p>"This is why, starting with our next big update in December, mods will be prohibited from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed."
</p>
<p>The update goes on to explain that mods will "still be allowed in private Operations lobbies". Grigorenko also says they'll release some of their own tools to make it easier for people to make mods.
</p>
<p>I'm not clear on what kind of mods people were taking into public servers, but it's a Warhammer 40,000 game, so naturally <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/?BH=2">Nexus Mods</a> has several pages of cosmetic re-paints of your soldiers. It also sounds as if a lot of players are hacking at the UI, blood effects and FOV options.
</p>
<p>Brendan had a lot of fun with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, finding it a spectacular jaunt and "pure ambrosia" for 40K fans.

        <p>Microsoft smoothly launch a videogame challenge 2024</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've been looking forward to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> since it was announced, but I might wait a while longer before trying to play it. It launched yesterday and currently sits at "overwhelmingly negative" Steam reviews due to long loading times caused by server issues.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the issues, developers Asobo posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM&amp;ab_channel=MicrosoftFlightSimulator">video message discussing the launch issues</a>.
</p>
<p>"We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure," says Jorg Neumann, head of Flight Simulator.
</p>
<p>Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch then explained that the issue was due to the number of players trying to access the game.
</p>
<p>"In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim," Wloch says. "People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.
</p>
<p>"It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed."
</p>
<p>Wloch explained that they've had some temporary success with attempted fixes so far, but that soon the "cache collapsed again". They're continuing to investigate in search of a permanent fix.
</p>
<p>In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2537590/view/4456969803786092545">posted to Steam about the launch issues</a>, the developers said that the problems are now "solved" and players should steadily be able to join the game. "We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience," says the post.
</p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 expands on the foundation built by the 2020 release, adding more detail to its simulation of the earth, and adding various kinds of aviation careers which add structure to your time in the skies. Edwin spoke to Neumann prior to the game's launch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-machine-learning-ai-and-how-much-of-your-data-it-might-need">about its machine learning tech and data streaming</a>. 
</p>
<p>We'll have a review of Flight Simualtor 2024 soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
