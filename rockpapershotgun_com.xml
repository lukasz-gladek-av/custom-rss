            <p>Blizzard announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzcon-wont-happen-in-2024">BlizzCon wouldn't happen in 2024</a>, with the live event instead being replaced by a series of franchise-focused streams. Next on the schedule is Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, which Blizzard have now announced will stream on Wednesday, November 13th at 6pm GMT/1pm ET/10am PT.
</p>

<p>"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a Hearthstone fan, you've joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," according <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">to the announcement</a>. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>The stream will be followed by a 20th anniversary concert celebrating 20 years of World Of Warcraft music.
</p>
<p>World Of Warcraft's The War Within launched earlier this year, but Blizzard have already spoken about it being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-next-three-expansions-have-been-announced-starting-with-the-war-within">the first in a trilogy of new expansions</a>. The next in line is World Of Warcraft: Midnight, which will then be followed by The Last Titan. 
</p>
<p>An expansion aside, I've no idea what other surprises or announcements could appear at the event. Hopefully something less disappointing than Warcraft 3 Reforged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">turned out to be</a>, and more exciting than a mobile game like Warcraft Rumble.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
