            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over. I'm sure everyone let out a final burst of fire that sounded equally triumphant and tragic at its conclusion. But wait, say EA, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lovers, where do you all think you're going?</p>
<p>It's at this point the publishers whip out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, the much-maligned at release previous entry in the series, like they're yanking a rabbit out of a marine's helmet. He's not Battlefield 2042 anymore, they say, he's the "road to Battlefield 6". A road one can only assume is littered with IEDs and checkpoints where five people are standing around looking mean. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This boulevard to blast central is update 9.2, and it's chunky enough that I'd class it as a full-on repaint the road markings affair. Classic map Iwo Jima makes its 2042 debut, with "boat landings, bunkers, and trenches on a reimagined 700x200 map". Oh, and an active volcano in case you want to renounce your warlike ways and take up volcanology.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there are two new guns - the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. Only the former's being dished out to everyone, with the Lynx only being given to folks who played the Battlefield 6 beta to start with. EA insist anyone who didn't hop into the beta will get a chance to grab it "later down the line". Meanwhile, two new attack jets, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot, have been added in. EA say they come with some revamped abilities and are designed to be "vehicle busters".</p><div>

<p>That sounds a bit rough for folks down below, trundling along the "road to Battlefield 6" in tanks or jeeps. Anyway, I'll drop the metaphor. The "road to Battlefield 6" is actually a 60-tiered free battle pass featuring a bunch of gear inspired by the series' history. It includes some stuff to unlock for Battlefield 6 itself and will run from August 18th to October 7th.</p>
<p>If you want a reminder of what Battlefield 2042 was like when it first debuted, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">Ed's review</a>. It's also evolved a fair bit since then, so a run through our 2042 news archives is probably a good shout if you want cluing up on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">some of the changes EA have made</a> over the years.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> may be an offer you can probably refuse, but it does have a lush-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> - "clearly designed with care and a sharp eye for capturing the beauty of a fairytale landscape that alternates between serene and rugged," as Mark "Ice Pick" Warren <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">wrote in our review</a>. </p>
<p>The game's focus on shootybangs and stabfights does the backdrop a disservice, as does its rather barren and easy-to-miss Exploration mode, which I hear is basically a chance to snaffle up some collectibles. Devs Hangar 13 and their godfathers at 2K Games aim to fix all that with a forthcoming Free Ride mode, which will "add some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months," according to a developer update.</p>
<p>Hangar 13's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> also had a Free Ride mode, which let you roam Lost Heaven taking on new missions and races and even tussling with alien invaders. I would assume The Old Country's version will be similar in both content and direction. Can't wait to see what flying saucers look like in 1900s Sicily.</p>
<p>I'm always happy when blockbuster devs add modes that encourage you to revisit and savour the texture of the world. Projects such as Mafia: The Old Country typically pour tens of millions into the creation of art assets that are doomed to be appreciated for around five seconds while players zip fecklessly from cover to cover.</p><p>I guess that mingled decadence and disposability is part of the triple-A thrill, like burning 100 dollar bills to light a cigar. Have you ever done that? I once set a five pound note on fire for a dare, but I extinguished it immediately and, I think, bought a coffee with it. This is why I will never run 2K Games.</p>
<p>Again, there's no hard launch date yet for Free Ride in Mafia: The Old Country. In the shorter term, Mark has dug up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-now-has-a-first-person-driving-mod-thats-ideal-for-capo-cruisin-when-its-not-utterly-terrifying">a first-person driving mod</a>, which allows you to savour the period detail at the modest expense of occasionally seeing your own eyeballs floating in front of your face.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Well, I say that, they've actually addressed "certain irregularities"</p>

            <p>South Korean publishers Nexon are investigating a recent bit of TikTok marketing for their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, after players spotted some ads that feature AI-generated 'human' streamers bigging up the game. Well, we at least have to assume it's following that, as Nexon's statement omits mentioning AI in favour of the wonderfully nebulous phrase "certain irregularities".</p>
<p>If you've not seen one of these ads that look to have been posted by The First Descendant's official account, allow me to show you, because you'll see right quick why folks have been asking questions. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1956400478855573771">Boom</a>. There are further booms compiled into one Reddit post by user iHardlyTriHard down below.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can see, them be some weird renderings of streamy blokes, especially the one who says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata in a fashion that'd be hilarious if this wasn't terrible AI sloppage. Seriously, he pronounces it NEER (pause for ten seconds) audomada. He also gets points for doubling up on his use of free-to-play in his attempt to get you hyped about an F2P update to the F2P looter shooter, which has launched F2Ply.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to the more obviously not-streamers, it appears the first one in the compilation below may be based on the likeness of streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DanieltheDemon/videos">DanieltheDemon</a>. He's since taken to the comments section of a TikTok about the clips to make clear he didn't agree to any of this. "I have no affiliation nor contract with The First Descendant," the streamer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@game.central/video/7539498130065214742">wrote</a>. "They stole my face/reactions from my most viral video and used AI to change what my mouth says and a voice that isn't mine. I did not consent for my likeness to be used..."</p> 
<p>While you can't find these full ads if you go to The First Descendant's official TikTok account, you can see some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525009515557932296?lang=en">gameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525333042924211463?lang=en">clips</a> the AI streamers have been paired with to deliver their samey sales pitches.</p>
<p>What do Nexon have to say about this? The <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators. As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a Creative Challenge program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials. All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content.</p>
<p>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts. We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the company ran <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en">a competition of sorts</a> that let anyone create ads for the game, which is a strange example of outsourcing at the very least, then seemingly left final approval for publication to TikTok's copyright checker, which merrily waved this dodgy stuff through. Either that or Nexon potentially gave it all the green light themselves. Either way, oof.</p><p>We'll have to see what the company say once that investigation's concluded, but here's hoping the next statement's a bit more like the easier-to-parse response offered when Nexon were accused of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-has-decided-to-make-adjustments-to-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons">a bit too much inspiration</a> from some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> icons.</p>

            <p>I was ready to skip MicroProse's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deck-and-conn">Deck &amp; Conn</a>, on the grounds of it being far too early in the week for games that consist entirely of dials and rangefinders, but then a scrambled communique from Sin Vega alerted me to the fact that it's the work of Elissa Black, one of the peeps behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/objects-in-space">Objects In Space</a>, which I think is one of my top five <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a>. So here we are. </p>
<p>At a glance, Deck &amp; Conn is Objects In Space, but turn-based and minus Objects In Space's slightly distracting 3D background elements. That's to say, it's a testing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategickal</a> simulation that seats you in front of a terrifying retro pixel display, and expects you to trace distress calls, manage your fretful crew, spin up torpedoes and so forth, all without bursting your puny monkey brain. </p><!--more-->
<p>It takes inspiration from older MicroProse games - the ones made by the MicroProse of the 1990s, before they got repeatedly bought and skinned and eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse#Brand_revival_(2018%E2%80%93present)">wrapped around the bones of a different company</a> - and the 1971 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> mainframe game, which is from before my time, though I think I've played one of its descendants in Thomas Spreen's Rescue!.</p>
<p>Being turn-based, Deck &amp; Conn should be a mite less stressful and exhilarating than Objects In Space, but I'm already having kittens over the sensor management tab in the screenshots. Remember: just because there's a dot on your radar doesn't mean that's where the ship you're fighting actually is. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The noble vessel you command in Deck &amp; Conn is "a Cold War-style nuclear corvette", which sounds about as safe as a bed of rusty nails. I'm guessing that it will not have enough reactor power for all the individual things you need it to do, prior to upgrades at least. Please brace to be impacted by these bullet points, direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3828500/Deck__Conn/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Command a nuclear-powered space corvette in a Cold War-inspired sci-fi universe</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and system management</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions</li>
<li>Individual combat scenarios to hone your tactical skills</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy ships to gain rewards and shape your legacy</li>
<li>Pixel art visuals inspired by early '90s MicroProse classics</li>
<li>Respond to HQ orders and make tough choices in the forever-war</li>
<li>Inspired by the 1971 Super Star Trek mainframe game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Black's other previous games include <a href="https://expectproblems.itch.io/swords-of-freeport">Swords Of Freeport</a>, "a text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s", which "is part MUD and part BBS Game - but without the need for a BBS. You can play it on your home machine alone, or play/install it on an internet-accessible machine where others can join you - anywhere they have terminal access."</p><p>That sounds like catnip to a certain venerable species of internet wayfarer. I think I prefer the space submarines personally. If you are similarly fond of astral tugboats with copious blind sides, you might enjoy playing or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-space-strategy-sim-nebulous-channels-eight-years-in-the-us-navy">reading about Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.</p>
<p><em>Small disclosure: Sin Vega is an online acquaintance of Elissa Black from back in the day.</em></p>
