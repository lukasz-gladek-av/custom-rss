            <p>Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 4 has been announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>.</p>
<p>The Orks are crying out, and it's because Dawn of War 4 is set to release at some point in 2026. The Orks are also crying out in a slightly more thoughtful manner, since the game's coming from German studio King Art Games, rather than original developer Relic.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>King art, the studio behind 1920s alt history RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iron-harvest-review">Iron Harvest</a>, are billing this as a return the series' roots. There'll be force growing, base building, squad specialising , and a Sync Kill system to show you gory melee combat details. Dawn of War 2's Last Stand mode returns, alongside AI skirmishes and multiplayer that runs from 1v1 to 3v3.</p>
<p>As for the plot, here's the synopsis: "Set many years after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, war has returned to the planet Kronus, along with Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz and several new commanders as four factions fight for supremacy. Kronus features a number of distinct biomes including the Wasteland, Iceland, Highlands, Hive City &amp; Manufactorum regions."</p>
<p>If you need a refresher as to the last time war dawne, our Fraser wrote the following in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-3-review">his review</a> of Dawn of War 3:</p>
<blockquote>There are moments, many of them, during multiplayer and AI skirmishes, where I’m absolutely certain that Dawn of War 3 is the best game in the series, even with its missteps when it comes to cover and fortifications. I could happily continue rambling on about the brilliant faction design or how I still squeal with glee every time I drop a gargantuan beast of an Elite like Imperial Knight Solaria into a fight – you haven’t lived until you’ve witnessed her impossibly huge guns turning an army of Orks into green-red paste. If you’re only interested in the campaign, however, then you’re unlikely to find as much to get enthused about.
</blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether a fresh studio really can take Dawn of War back to it's, er, dawn of war.</p>

<p>The game's set in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> and stars veteran Black Opser David Mason. It's delivering a bit of futuristic and psychological weirdness alongside the usual war. There's a campaign that you can tackle solo or with up to four-players via co-op. This campaign also has an endgame called Endgame, which is definitely peak videogames.</p>
<p>It's set in 2035, with the likes of Raul Menendez and Emma Kagan, CEO of a tech company dubbed The Guild, looking like they're the baddies. Aside from that, it's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>.</p>
<p>There's an an open beta starting on 2nd October with early access for those who pre-order or subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console. We'll hear more about Black Ops 7's multiplayer bits at a Call of Duty Next showcase on September 30.</p>
