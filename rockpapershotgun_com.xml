            <p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has responded to a shareholder question about the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign - and in a very newsworthy corporate question and answer session, revealed that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint">Ghost Recon</a> game's in the works.</p>
<p>To quickly recap, Stop Killing Games aim to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable after the cessation of official support. They were inspired to take action by Ubisoft themselves 'sunsetting' online racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's response to their campaign comes around the time the group's petition to the EU to take action against the mass extinction of online games <a href="https://x.com/StopKilingGames/status/1947064216298406179">hits 1.4 million signatures</a>. Despite some doubts about potential signature spoofing, the petition's recently attracted support from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">EU politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">industry trade bodies</a>, so it's no surprise Guillemot's fielding questions about it from moneyfolk.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," the CEO began (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a>), immediately whipping out what I assume's the corporate version of the phrase '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHhbdXCzt_A&amp;t=1s">we're living in a society</a>'. He went on to say that players are "forewarned that eventually the game may be discontinued", and framed the studio putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> on sale for €1/$1 back in 2024 as an attempt to let players of the first game hop across to one that wasn't about to be deep-sixed.</p>
<p>"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued," Guillemot continued, "Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that’s an issue that we’re working on. That’s something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p>
<p>The exec closed out his point by saying that the likes of software and tools made to make live-service games "become obsolete" or no longer available in time, outlining that this is why studios can opt to put out new versions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games have been clear they're not asking for all online games to be "eternal", but rather to "implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary".</p>
<p>Moving away from Stop Killing Games, in the same shareholder ask-a-thon Guillemot and Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet casually alluded to a new Ghost Recon being in development. The CEO mentioned "capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon", while Duguet touched on investment from Tencent being used for "future development of other major brand names", citing Ghost Recon as an example.</p>
<p>Confirming the execs' chatter about the ghost reconning their attic, an Ubisoft spokesperson has told Game File that the publishers "look forward to sharing more when the time is right". Nice. Here's hoping it doesn't come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-launching-ghost-recon-breakpoint-nfts-later-this-week">NFT trousers</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-ceo-responds-to-stop-killing-games-and-casually-mentions-a-new-ghost-recon-games-coming]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I recently took on a garden allotment tenancy for what I now consider the tellingly low rent of £60 a year. Arming myself with some shiny new shears, I visited my little slice of heaven and found it to be a resentful thicket of Guinness cans, sacks of worrying discarded clothing, nettles sturdier than barbed wire, and insects of a kind I have never seen before and never care to again. 
</p>
<p>
At one point I got my foot stuck in a long-abandoned bucket and, while running around in a panic, put my other foot through a red ant nest. It was a lot like playing the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cleanfall">Cleanfall</a>, except that I can't build an airship out of flying jellyfish and flamethrowers and blast this stupid allotment into submission. Mind you, Cleanfall is evidence that an airship made of flying jellyfish and flame throwers will only get you so far.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I wrote up the release of the demo last year, summarising the game SEOishly as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> with a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>". I have now played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2769780/view/543361383085903981?l=english">another, updated demo</a>, following the announcement that Cleanfall will enter early access on 8th August, and my summary has narrowed to "side-scrolling Scavenger's Reign".</p>
<p>In Cleanfall, you are a robot who is trying to tunnel to the core of a planet full of wriggly things. Some of the wriggly things are docile, at least before they're provoked. In the opening jungle layer, for example, there are frogs that belch and bobble about in search of edible greenery. How cute! You can even stand on them without pissing them off. But then comes night, and with night comes a sea of glowing red eyes, pouring into the layout from all sides.

<p>
The thing about the red-eyed nightfiends is that at least you know they're hostile. A lot of the organisms in Cleanfall are hard to categorise without risking a confrontation. I've spent a lot of the demo listening to unseen critter calls with a furrowed brow, trying to work out whether "squibleeyahckckckc" means "stay the hell away from my nest" or "where my edible greenery at". The consumable items can be similarly mysterious. What does a "nanite egg" do? Oh, it instantly decomposes the entire cave I'm standing in. I should have kept that one in reserve, probably.
</p>
<p>
The one surety is that you need covering fire, because threats come from all directions. Usefully, the chasms teem with vending machines where you can trade lumps of ore and dead insect for turrets, which secure themselves springily to the terrain when placed. Each night, you hole up somewhere behind a bunch of these automated guns, hoping like hell you've placed enough.
</p>
<p>
Even better, you seek refuge in the skies. See that veiny purple dirigible that idly spits out twirling explosive seedlings? Attach a platform here and some Gatlings there and a rocket thruster here and presto, you have yourself a flying fortress.</p>
<p>The first time I built a flying fortress in Cleanfall, I fell clean out of it. The fortress carried on blasting at creatures on the upper levels, deluging me in crafting materials as I sought a way back up. It made for an efficient farming operation, I guess, but that was before sundown. As the shadows drew close, I consulted my inventory. Hmm, I don't think this "fart bulb" is going to help me much, or at least, not for long enough. I sure could go for a nanite egg right now.

<p>
Things I haven't mentioned: the newly updated demo has overhauled UI elements and jetpacks for certain character classes. You get three lives, with the ability to ghost around a bit before you respawn: once you've used them all up, you're transported back to the surface by a phantom train. The surface is home to a tall man with a very long nose and a top hat, who professes to be your friend. I'm sure he's nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Cleanfall is scruffy and unwilling and volatile, all the key components of a good video game in the year of our Lord 2025. I get the sense that, unlike my mutinous and possibly haunted allotment, this one will be a keeper. Let me know if you have any thoughts on the demo and also, if you have any advice about humane ant relocation strategies.
