            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">recent round of layoffs at Respawn parent company EA</a> reportedly lead to around 300 to 400 job losses, plus cancellations of two incubation projects. It's since come out that one of those projects was likely an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe, codenamed 'R7'. This joins an unannounced single player<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unannounced-single-player-titanfall-game-has-been-cancelled-by-ea"> Titanfall game cancelled in 2023</a>, alongside the perpetually rumoured but yet-to-materialise Titanfall 3. It has, in brief, been a rough <em>forever </em>to be a fan of Respawn's exciting mix of parkour shooting and mech piloting combat.</p>
<p>But what's this? Nestled in the replies to this good<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/headfallsoff.com/post/3lnxved4uwc25"> Bluesky post</a> lies the promise of a mechful consolation prize. "Oopsie I dropped this legally distinct fan project," writes Diesel Knights developer Xavier B. Johnson, alongside one of those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2785740/Diesel_Knights/">Steam links I know you all enjoy</a>. "Diesel Knights is a 6-v-6, Mech/Movement Shooter set in a pulp-inspired, dieselpunk world", and you can request access to the upcoming playtest right now.</p>

<p>"Stunningly rendered for the first time in dazzling full color! Join us now for these treacherous tales of the dauntless Diesel Knights and their fearsome fighting machines," reads Steam. "Utilize verticality and momentum to outmaneuver your opponents in all new first or third person multiplayer action or compete for the fastest time in the time trial mode".</p>
<p>Everything's pre-alpha at the moment, but I do still enjoy the rusty charm of the "mid-century inspired weapons and gadgets". This one's published by Philadelphia collective Keyframe Crew, who previously worked on this <a href="https://www.habitheque.com/an-otter-planet">nice game about space otters</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
