            <p>
Bad news everybody, I think I have discovered the game that is going to stop you doing anything else today. Witness the verminous splendour of turn-based puzzler Rat King, in which you simultaneously control two rodents who are exploring two different dungeons in splitscreen. I know, I know – to lose one rat in a dungeon may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness. But there is method to the madness. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Each questing squealer shares the same health bar, but faces a different 5x5 square room layout and enemy spawning patterns. As such, they will inevitably end up out of synch - one rat lodged in the corner of a room, for example, while the other fends off beetles in the middle. You need to work out the sequence of moves that keeps both rats alive, while scooping up coins to spend on items at shops, and guiding the varmints to the staircase to the next floor. 
</p>
<p>
It’s immediately engrossing, and it layers up very satisfyingly. Each rat can move between the rooms of its particular dungeon without waiting for the other, allowing you to effectively "reshuffle" one half of the screen when you can’t see a way to avoid damage. One obvious way to get your skavens in synch is to line them up against parallel walls, but if you bounce off surfaces repeatedly you’ll waken a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>The ghosts are a lovely wordless characterisation of a soft design constraint. The basic idea is just to punish you for brute-forcing the simultaneous-move mechanic, but also, it makes sense that rapping on the walls of catacombs would rouse their resident spectres.
</p>
<p>
Items can be very helpful, though they only apply to the screen half in which they’re collected. There’s an ice cube that freezes a room’s enemies in place, for example, and a purple swirly that spins one rat’s control inputs around, allowing for more flexible movement as long as you don’t confuse yourself. 
</p>
<p>
The latter item makes the game feel like a lockpicking minigame in an Elder Scrolls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but the correct reference here is Michael Brough’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/868-hack">868-Hack</a>, which stole the luncheons and sleeping hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-works-and-why-betting-on-yourself-in-868-hack">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/priceless-play-2nd-november-2018">RPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/868-hack-review-pc">scribes</a> in times of yore. I haven’t played many "broughlikes", or at least, not knowingly, but Rat King already feels like a classic of the form.  I’ve only scraped the skin, I’m sure. <a href="https://torcado.itch.io/rat-king">Find it on Itch.io</a>.

            <p>Riot's spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> with the terrible name, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, is getting a closed beta in a few months and, to entice fans to sign up, the developers have released a new video showing off pink-haired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> bruiser Vi doing some biffing. I know you like biffing, so I'm telling you about this despite being unable to reliably write the title of this free-to-play wrecker without carefully typing it out like my mum composing an email with a single forefinger. </p>

<p>"2XKO’s Closed Beta starts September 9, available globally on PC," said Riot in <a href="https://x.com/Play2XKO/status/1947686336020025842">a press release on social media</a>. "After Closed Beta begins, our goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance. This is a huge step for us. We’ll be deploying our backend systems at a larger scale for the first time, so things might be bumpy at first, but we’ll improve as we go."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/">sign up here</a> if you are eager to batter Vi for all her baffling choices in Arcane's disappointingly disjointed second season. The beta will only happen on PC, so feel free to be a smug wretch to your long-suffering Xbox friends, although Riot do say that any progression made on PC will cross over to console if you decide to play on multiple platforms.</p>

<p>2KXO was-- excuse me, I mean 2OXK was - sorry, 2XOK was... FUCK. The fighting game formerly known as Project L was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-confirm-fighting-game-in-development">revealed during the EVO fighting game championship in 2019</a>, even though rumours and leaks outed the game not too long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rising-thunder-cancelled">Riot bought Rising Thunder developer Radiant Entertainment</a> way back in 2016. The game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">given its untypeable moniker</a> last year, on the logic that it is a tag-team fighter in which you field 2x brawlers, and that those 2x brawlers will presumably KO somebody. 2... X... K... O, see? </p>
<p>I know. I hate it too. But if you're legitimately interested in the game's ins and outs, Riot have <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/whats-new-in-alpha-lab-2/">an admittedly thorough breakdown of a previous alpha</a> which shows various features, including how the tag team assists will work, as well as clues to how battle-passy things will get when it comes to unlocking cosmetics. This is something that will be interesting to witness, because cosmetics in a fighting game need to be interesting without obscuring or distracting from the clarity of the action. Will I be able to dress up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dressing-up-as-santa-in-tekken-7-and-visiting-players">a cleanly defined Santa</a>, for example? Only time will tell.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>
