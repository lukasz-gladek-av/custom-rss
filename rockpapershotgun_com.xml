            <p>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it's the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.
</p>
<p>So it is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ-unflattened">Trombone Champ: Unflattened</a>, a VR spin-off that's out now.

<p>Made by Flat2VR Studios, a company that specialises in, as their name suggests, bringing games from flat screens to VR, Unflattened seems like more than a straight re-formatting. The menus are all new, the notes whizz towards you <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a>-style, there are cosmetic unlocks for the trombone, and you can unlock and trade cards of famous musicians from throughout history.
</p>
<p>The fundamental tooting remains the same, mind you. Trombone Champ: Unflattened is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151670/Trombone_Champ_Unflattened/">available from Steam</a> and will work with more VR headsets than just the Meta Quest featured in the trailer above. It costs £12.79/€14.79/$15.
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Unflattened will retain the best thing about the original: the community that surrounds it. Trombone Champ players have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">organised championship competitions</a>, made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">custom tracks</a>, and turned those custom tracks into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">excellent YouTube videos</a> to enjoy whether or not you play the game yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Steam autumn sale</a>. 
</p>
<p>Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I think I'm right in saying that Steam sales are, at the very least, not <em>as</em> exciting as they once were, if only because we've grown used to them. It no longer seems like a miraculous surprise to have so many games deeply discounted all at once. Doubly and triply so once you factor in all the other digital storefronts, all of which also have their own big seasonal sales.

<p>Maybe it's also just become harder to find the truly spectacular deals because there's now so many of them. Sure, it's great that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> is £1.59, but it's forever slashed to cheap, so it's hard to get pumped about it. Instead it just feels like it's obscuring the handful of games where its discount is actually news. 
</p><p>It feels like a bigger deal that Hitman: World Of Assassination is a mere £2.49, a full 90% off for some of the best stealth gaming ever made. 25% off a game as new as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is significant, although it's still £45. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> at £30 feels like a good entry point for players uncertain about a slightly off-kilter fantasy RPG.
</p>
<p>Maybe we just all permanently have more games than we can ever play now. Between bundles and freebies, who needs spend money, discounted or otherwise, just to throw another game on the backlog?
</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm simply out of touch. There are definitely going to be some people saving their pennies and waiting for each new Steam sale to arrive, and more power to you. I'm not pooh-poohing Steam sales, so please put away your phone flashlights. I am genuinely curious how the RPS commenter is split, however: do you share my malaise, or are you currently posting Gaben memes in the group chat? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In Ndemic Creations' mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Plague Inc, you nurture a disease and attempt to spread it across the world. Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, a blend of city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To be more specific, the game is set in "a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom". You'll found and develop an expanse of cosy blue rooftops, sleepy windmills and golden cornfields in the shadow of canted, overgrown city blocks. Mind the zombies, though. There are still a few of them lurking in the undergrowth, threatening to spoil the neo-rustic bonhomie. Find a rundown of key features below, air-lifted from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/">the Steam page</a>. The mention of "democracy or authoritarianism" makes this sound like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s rosy-cheeked stepchild.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Exploit the ruins of the past to scavenge / harvest resources.
</p>
<p>
- Expand your Settlement with housing, farms, lumberyards and much more.
</p>
<p>
- Shape your society and provide services to keep your people happy.
</p>
<p>
- Make difficult decisions - Are children an unaffordable luxury? Are dogs pets or a food source? Democracy or Authoritarianism?
</p>
<p>
- Exterminate zombie infestations and defend humanity.
</p>
<p>
- Explore a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
- Build multiple settlements in a persistent campaign and level up abilities.
</p>
<p>
- Ultra-realistic modelling of Zombie behaviour based on real-life studies... :P
</p>
<p>
- Sophisticated narrative algorithms shaped by your decisions.
</p>
<p>
- 10 unique leaders with radically different abilities.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The game's out in early access in 2025, though you can install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndemiccreations.afterinc&amp;hl=en">a free-to-play mobile version</a> right now. The early access period will bring new settlement leaders, "more levels", "expanded campaigns", new character traits and crises, expanded localisation, and clues about the origins and workings of the Necroa virus responsible for the undead outbreak.
</p><p>
I like After Inc's art and choice of perspective, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. I'm also interested in, and a little worried by, the game's portrayal of aftermath, which I imagine can't help but be a commentary on feelings about the coronavirus pandemic, for all its B-movie fantasy framing (the developers play up the connection in press materials, joking a little tactlessly that "After Inc: Revival is not based on any real-world situation" and there's "no need to start worrying about a real-life zombie apocalypse yet"). I'd like to know whether After Inc echoes or challenges the benign rhetoric of a "return to normal", which disregards the fact that Covid is still very much with us and a source of <a href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19">considerable death and disability</a>.
