<p>A question, readers. What sounds more fun: doddering about on your own two feet – like an <em>idiot</em> – or storming through deserts on a cannon-packing megacrab? I only make such a clearly self-answering inquiry because for some reason DuneCrawl, or at least the Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833200/DuneCrawl/">demo</a> that shows off its isometric action, seems to think both sides have valid points.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They do not. I’ve played solo and with licensed crustacean pilot Brendy in co-op, and on neither occasion did the on-foot combat sections click. There are rare moments of comedy chaos, where one teammate accidentally detonates another in the midst of blasting an enemy or breaking open a cracked wall, but ultimately it feels less like a swashbuckling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> and more like a kind of multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deaths-door">Death’s Door</a> where everyone’s on their fifth G&amp;T. All awkward swordfighting, sluggish shooting, and constant rolling in place of positioning nous.</p>

<p>Then you get on the big crab, and it fuckin’ rocks. Beyond the simple, base pleasures of duelling other battle walkers on a manor-sized shellfish, this is where DuneCrawl finally starts feeling like a proper co-op game. With one player at the helm, others will scurry hurriedly around the deck, loading and firing cannons while slathering on goop to heal the crab’s damaged legs. The demo only contains one crawler-versus-crawler duel, but it’s easily the highlight: a delightfully shambolic spectacle that, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guns-icarus-online">Guns of Icarus</a> dogfight or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> naval clash, manages to feel pacey and urgent in spite of the inherent unwieldiness of the craft involved.</p>
<p>I’d say that DuneCrawl would be better if you never left the crab, but then that would deny it two of its funniest quirks. One: it’s possible to be blown off the deck entirely by enemy fire, a detail I could appreciate from the vantage point of thirty feet in the air after a cannonball flung me clear of Crawl McCartney (Brendy let me name the crab) and into the sand below. Two: it’s possible, if not outright encouraged, to fire yourself out of friendly or captured cannons, which is perfect for countering landbound defences or boarding a hostile walker in a hurry. I know I said the on-foot battles aren’t as good, but I’ll make a temporary exception for whenever I want to aerially deliver myself face-first onto the bad guys’ main deck.</p>

<p>There is some non-endearing jank that needs addressing. Performance is weirdly ropey for a game that thinks photorealism is how plants eat sunlight, my RTX 3090 stuttering heavily at 1440p. And the demo’s invisible boundary, an otherwise understandable roadblock to just sauntering off and exploring the entire game’s desert for free, forced mine and Brendy’s adventure into an ignominious end. While searching for more crawlers to fight, the barrier bumped us clean off ol’ McCartney, while letting our crab stumble further into the forbidden zone on his own momentum and making him impossible to retrieve, forcing a long, dusty walk back to base.</p>
<p>A shame, as we were well up for more stompy crab fights at that point. I for one still am, provided the full game doesn’t keep me on land for too long in exchange.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2023, the <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion</a> team <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1672629175037972482?s=20">announced</a> that their project to recreate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine was on track for a 2025 release date. Well, steal my sweet rolls and shout me off a mountain, the mad candles have gone and done it. At least, that's the plan according to a <a href="https://youtu.be/Dvlz8CYCQzc">new live gameplay demo and Q&amp;A video</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrim-has-a-new-video-looks-amazing-is-set-for-release-this-year-and-i-struggle-to-imagine-the-rumoured-official-oblivion-remake-doing-much-better/">PC Gamer</a>.)</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/">Skywind</a>) has been in development since 2012, made by a team of experienced volunteers. "It's coming along incredibly," says mechanics lead Scott Whiting in the above video, "we're confident we can get it out this year." The video shows off the city of Cheydinhal, with NPC interactions and quests. I'm especially impressed by the UI here, striking a lovely balance between Skyrim's pared-down readability and Oblivion's more ornate parchment. As well as recreating Oblivion's huge world, the team are also adding music tracks and sprucing up dungeon environments so they better match the regions they're found in.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a team of volunteers working for over 10 years purely for the love of the game wasn't heartening enough, they also managed to raise $1200 for Make-A-Wish International during the stream.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've played Oblivion, although I do vaguely remember some sort of famous 'horse amour' controversy, in which conservative news pundits waxed hysterical about the game letting you marry your equine companion (the official terminology decided on by Bethesda after the word 'mount' was deemed inappropriate).</p>
<p>As for the fabled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 6</a>? We know as much as you do. Unless you know more than us, in which case do tell because that news piece would obviously do gangbusters. My own personal tinfoil hat theory is that Bethesda are holding back until they've devised some nefarious new scheme to monetise it in hitherto unimaginably irksome ways, but that's based on nothing except years of observing the game industry with my own two eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
