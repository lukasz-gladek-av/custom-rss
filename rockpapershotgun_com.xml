            <p>A bundle of games aiming to raise money to aid the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in their efforts to help Palestinian refugees is set to go on sale via Itch.io next week. Just over 380 games are part of it, including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucifer-within-us">Lucifer Within Us</a>, and a <a href="https://pajamabeevegan.itch.io/cowlifesimrpg">cow life simulator</a> that features an alligator who's really into arson.</p>
<p>Organised by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/junchgaming.bsky.social">Junch</a> and the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seagamesforgood.bsky.social">South East Asian Games for Good initiative</a>, the bundle's dubbed Play for Peace - Games for Palestine. It's taken over 10 months to come together. The result's a 382-game strong bundle that includes a huge variety of creations that contain not a whiff of AI or NFTs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The people of Palestine continue to be subjected to hostility, destruction of homes, critical infrastructure, and devastasting loss of lives," reads the Play for Peace bundle's freshly-published <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle">Itch listing</a>. "We, as a games community, will bring together our incredible games from across the world, for a charity bundle with proceeds that go directly to Palestine aid and relief.</p>
<p>"We are partnering with UNRWA USA, who will receive the funds and grant them to <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/">UNRWA (UN agency)</a> in support of direct humanitarian aid in Palestine. Together, the game dev community and UNRWA USA will raise awareness on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the situation in Gaza</a>, spotlight our communities, and the devs participating in this charity drive."</p><p>In addition to the games I mentioned in the intro - the cow life sim's definitely worth checking out - the bundle includes everything from lesbian devil-hunting action, courtesy of fittingly-named boss rusher <a href="https://itsmelilyv.itch.io/bossgame">Bossgame</a>, to tabletop adventures like <a href="https://heycentaur.itch.io/hetthamsya">Stirring the Hornet's Nest at Het Thamsya</a>. A couple of others that've caught me eye are <a href="https://black-heart-games-studio.itch.io/street-cleaning-day">Street Cleaning Day: Rat's Revenge</a>, a wave-shooter about a rodent fending off soapy bubbles, and <a href="https://goosewho.itch.io/i-get-this-call-every-day">I Get This Call Every Day</a>.</p>
<p>The latter's a point-and-click simulation of its creator's experience working in a call centre, featuring "terrible art [which] conveys a terrible work environment" and the choice of whether to "lose politely or lose spectacularly".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We're excited to announce the Games for Palestine charity page is now LIVE on Itch. </p><p>Over 300+ games with proceeds going to UNRWA USA in support of Gaza relief. Thank you to everyone for your support. The bundle launches on Sept 2nd 9am PST.  </p><p> Link: <a href="https://t.co/QfK0ekUjAd">https://t.co/QfK0ekUjAd</a> <a href="https://t.co/KIaZNj2f1P">pic.twitter.com/KIaZNj2f1P</a></p></div>— SE Asian Games for Good (@seagamesforgood) <a href="https://twitter.com/seagamesforgood/status/1960661787260674322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If that brutal reality isn't for you, there's also <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/fit-for-a-king">Fit For a King</a>, a Henry VIII simulator that offers the chance to marry everything, execute everything, and/or spend it all. "While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fit-for-a-king">Fit For A King</a> could have been full of lazy, bargain bin Blackadder jokes, it’s got a wonderfully dadaist edge to its humour instead, and an indefinable atmosphere I could only call early 2000s web game energy," former RPSer Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-fit-for-a-king">wrote of that one</a>. Or, there's <a href="https://daffodil.itch.io/virtua-blinds">Virtua Blinds</a>, which looks like it could be the greatest thing I've never played.</p>
<p>As the bundle's curators wrote: "All of it represents the creative expression of artists and developers who want to help raise money through their art for one of the most important causes of our time - freedom and the ending of genocide in Palestine." The Play for Peace - Games for Palestine bundle will be on sale from 5PM BST/12PM ET/9AMPT/6PM CEST on September 2nd, and will cost $8.</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only more bloody downloadable content for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. Developers Saber Interactive are supposed to be working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a>, but you wouldn't know that from all the Stuff they've jammed into the previous game's year 2 content schedule. There's a major Anniversary patch due on 4th September, just in time for Silksong. Five more patches are coming over 2025 and 2026, plus nine DLC packs via season pass. The manufactorums are overflowing! Here's a video to lay it all out.</p><!--more-->

<p>The standout upcoming option is probably the new playable Techmarine class, who don't get any screentime here. What is a Techmarine? A Space Marine with a lot of spanners where parts of their anatomy should be. They're good at fixing stuff, though one suspects that, like most Sparse Maureens in Spice Margerine 2, they'll spend the bulk of their time murdering things.
</p>
<p>Techmarines aside, the free updates will add new enemies, bosses, weapons, progression mechanics, PvE stratagems, Eternal War arenas, and operations. Also, the chance to play a Chaos Helbrute, which looks like a berserking tractor with a comically small humanoid head. It's like Bruce Banner got 90% of the way through Hulking out and ran out of rage. Still, let's see if you're still laughing when it stands on your toes in the forthcoming Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode.

<p>As for those paid DLCs, there will be the usual shower of cosmetics. The new battle pass kicks off with the Black Templars Champion Pack, which includes a Champion skin for the Bulkwark class and a Power Sword skin. Then there's the Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, which comprises 40 new cosmetics. Future packs will include cosmetics for the Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons. I'm pretty sure they made some of those Space Marine chapters up. Iron Hands, lol, as if.
</p><p>The only thing missing from Space Marine 2's roadmap, to my mind, is a mutual crossover with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> universe - a prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">once dangled by Arrowhead's CEO</a>, many moons ago. Let us make the commodified fascists fight! Let us see whose space-bigotry is burlier! Arrowhead have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-first-licensed-crossover-is-also-killzones-official-debut-on-pc-sort-of">partnered with the goose-stepping Helghast from Killzone</a>. Add Warhammer 40,000's Space Marines to the mix and you're basically playing an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planetside">PlanetSide</a> 3. Seriously, there's like, at least six battle passes worth of content here.</p>
