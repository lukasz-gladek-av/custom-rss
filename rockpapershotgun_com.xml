            <p>The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dauntless">Dauntless</a> have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The studio has been owned by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">secretive blockchain company Forte</a> since some time in 2023. Since that year Phoenix Labs have seen three other rounds of layoffs. The studio saw 140 job cuts in May last year, while 34 jobs were axed back in December 2023. Before that, the company cut loose 9 percent of their workers in May 2023.</p>
<p>Over the same period there has been growing player dissatisfaction with Dauntless, which was generally well received when it first arrived. Edwin called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-preview">"Monster Hunter for people who fear grind"</a>. But recent player reviews complain that free-to-play business tactics have been increasingly interfering with basic design of the game. The game has been on PC and other platforms since 2019 but its arrival to Valve's shopfront in December last year came with a big update called "Awakening".</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of changes, this update included the bizarre decision to essentially wipe every player's character progression and weapon collections to zero. As you might expect, the game quickly attained an "overwhelmingly negative" review average on the store. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, this update was criticised by the studio's former associate producer, Jessie Leigh Gagnon, who said it was no longer "free to slay" in complaints spotted by <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/329756/former-dauntless-associate-producer-criticizes-awakening-update-for-gutting-core-mechanics">TechPowerUp</a>.</p>
<p>"They’ve gutted the core gameplay and crafting mechanics," she said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271577078045540352/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. "The essence of the Slayers (who I named just over ten years ago), has been, in fact, slayed to ribbons. We never would have made decisions that are so blatantly not player focused."   </p><p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/603016424736163000">soon apologised for the way the update was handled</a>, and recognised player distaste for the progress wipe and other changes. They handed out in-game currency and XP as part of this apology, saying that they would work to make things better. "We recognize the need to rebuild trust and improve how we engage with our community," they said. It's hard to see how this might now happen - it's possible even the person who wrote these words is now unemployed.</p>
<p>"We will share more details in the coming weeks," say Phoenix Labs about the future of Dauntless (and the studio's other game, Stardew-like farming simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>). But whatever they say it will be hard to take at face value, given that previous statements insisted the studio's games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-and-fae-farm-devs-lay-off-34-people-but-insist-dlc-plans-and-unannounced-games-unaffected">would be "unaffected" by the periodic layoffs</a>. 

</p><p>On top of these concerns, we also have to remember that behind Phoenix Labs there stands an inscrutable blockchain company in the shadows, smoking the world's forests and typing decisions nobody can see into an iPhone. When Forte bought the studio, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">reportedly instructed management</a> at Phoenix Labs not to tell anybody that the blockchain group were the new owners. Which is, uh, I believe the business term is:  fucked up. </p>
<p>Forte's only other game studio during that time were the mobile game developers Rumble Games. They were shut down by the blockchain company in July last year. </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> community was briefly awash with rumours than publisher NetEase were playing 4D chess with their hero-loving hearts last week, according to a new report by Michael Cripe for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">Ian Games</a> The rumours began in a Discord for the team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> named Marvel Rivals Leaks, where user Keone speculated that NetEase were seeding fake information on upcoming heroes for dataminers to find.</p>

<p>"It has come to our attention that the devs have set up fake characters to catch leakers," wrote Keone in the Discord. "Not only the ones in the code - but potentially inside sources too". They then gave a list of previously rumoured heroes they now believed were "very likely fake", including Quicksilver, Professor X, and Paste Pot Pete, who I hadn't heard of until now and suddenly I have a renewed interested in Marvel.</p>
<p>The Discord, says the report, had previously found some success catching heroes before their official announcement, such as the Fantastic Four. The rumour gained some traction before reaching datamining group X0XLeak, who weren't so convinced. "Could they be intended troll by NetEase? I guess,” an X0XLeak spokesninja told IGN. "Would it make sense, in my opinion? No. The way I see it, they could have made it way easier if their goal was to troll us.” They also posted <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227">an X thread</a> as evidence that the rumoured-then-unrumoured heroes existed in the game's code, thoroughly re-rumouring them once again. From IGN's report:</p>
<blockquote><p>X0X’s matfacio told IGN that, if NetEase had truly tucked away bait to trick leakers in this way, it would need to know exactly how dataminers are rummaging through the Marvel Rivals backend, explaining: “I think it would require reverse engineering a reverse engineer.”</p>
<p>The existence of new, hidden hero names in Marvel Rivals doesn’t totally poor cold water on the idea that the developers are attempting to mislead, but some believe the studio would have to go through a lot of trouble — likely more trouble than it’s worth — just to keep the more dedicated fans on their toes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That "trouble" includes things like datamined voice line events and gameplay tags, which some community members reckoned represented <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1882535375387697271">far too much work</a> to be part of an elaborate hoax. Keone did end up amending their initial stance, saying that their post spread beyond their control before they could make edits.</p><p>"The primary assumption from the main leakers (separate from me, the ones who have most info) now is that the ‘plants’ are in fact still real. And the developers did not intend for us to find them," Keone says. "That's why I edited the original post and since deleted it, and have worked to help clear up confusion surrounding it."</p>
<p>Please do have a read of the report in full for all the details and context. I don't play Marvel Rivals myself, but I found this one interesting since - while it's somewhat of a well-seasoned nothing burger - it's fundamentally just a group of passionate players wanting to share the excitement of getting new toys to play with. Hell, <em>I'm </em>excited about Paste Pot Pete and I haven't watched a Marvel film since X-Men 2, nor played a videogame in 15 years.</p>
<p>"A server that started small to spread information has now become a cornerstone of information across the entire community, and sometimes we can misinterpret things or make mistakes," Keone told IGN. "We're a group of people working hard to find and share information, and there's never malice behind what we post. We'll work hard to make sure things don't spread like wildfire again unless it's been verified first, and are grateful for everything we've been able to share thus far."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games">pronounced horror slant</a>, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.  </p>

<p>This is good news, also, because last year was a fraught one for People Can Fly. Back in January, we learned from an email obtained by Kotaku that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">Polish studio were laying off 30 people</a>, alongside 20 people being moved from an unannounced Square Enix project named Gemini. They cancelled another project - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">a co-op action RPG named Project Dagger</a> - in April. Last December, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">parted wallets with a further 120 workers</a>, shelved one project, and downsized another. "We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," said chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski at the time.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed every People Can Fly game I've played, including Outriders - an excellent shooter, albeit one buried under a clumpy mountain of pre-peed live service cat litter. As for E-Day, it's primed to be a soft series reboot of sorts. "Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," said The Coalition studio head Mike Crump in a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/">press release</a>. "We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p><p>Gears Of War has always been an interesting series to me because it initially got my - and I imagine a lot of other people's - attention <a href="https://youtu.be/wy8LRlS1SCc">through an emotional beat in a trailer</a> that never really found its analogue in the actual games themselves. I sort of get the sense that's what E-Day is aiming for, especially if the strains of Mad World in the above teaser are any indication. I haven't kept up with the series all that closely over the years though, so I'm not sure how often they milk that song in marketing. I imagine it's probably a lot now I think about it. Either way, It's been long enough that I could absolutely go for some big man chainsaw misery. Perhaps in 2025, though no confirmation on that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
