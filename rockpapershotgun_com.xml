            <p>Frogwares have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-reveal-wet-survival-horror-sequel-the-sinking-city-2-taking-the-dev-in-a-newer-direction-in-2025">delayed the release</a> of Lovecraftian survival horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> to the first half of 2026, citing the effects of developing a game in amid the war between Russia and Ukraine as having understandably affected how long it's taken to get things done. There's no concrete new date as of right now, but the studio have shared some work-in-progress screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares publishing head Sergiy Oganesyan said of <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/">the delay</a>. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn.</p>
<p>"You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning. These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time."</p>
<p>"We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know," he added. "We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years."</p><p>Alongside the 13 fresh screenshots the team have shared as part of the delay announcement, some of which I've included below, Frogwares' senior social media manager Anna Bieniek said that the studio are planning to show off "a lot more gameplay over the next few months to let everyone see how development is going".</p>



<p>The devs add that the extra time will give them leeway to ensure they've stuck the landing as well as they'd link in their switch from detective-style action to full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">survival horror</a>, which has been "a whole new kind of challenge".</p>
<p>Our Alice B had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">mixed thoughts</a> on the original Sinking City, summing them up thusly:</p>
<blockquote>Without the weird Lovecraftian bits, this is a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town. Taking them into account, I don’t know! I was confused and uncharmed by the whole thing, but I still haven’t untangled my brainnoodles. At least I’ve told you how they got tangled. Goodness, I was very interested in The Sinking City. I really wanted to love it. But I’m afraid rain may have stopped play this time.</blockquote>
<p>Solidarity to Frogwares' devs as they carry on working get their game over the line in very tough circumstances.</p>

            <p>
Mere moments before release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed by the occult implosion of developers The Chinese Room, seemingly triggered by a last-ditch request from Paradox Interactive to add a microtransaction system and start charging for every bitten neck. 
</p>
<p>
There is nothing left of The Chinese Room now. Nothing but a huge bubble of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMy885mRf-s">Cromwell invocations</a> and bisexual lighting, right in the middle of Portsmouth. Occasionally, a level designer erupts from the congealing iridescent surface, begging to be allowed to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> 2 instead, only to be dragged back into the orb by a thousand, vermillion-painted fingers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Prior to becoming a gore singularity, Bloodlines 2's developers had been poised to celebrate the fateful release of a game synonymous with development hell. Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">announced in 2019</a>. Back then, it was in development at Hardsuit Labs, with original Bloodlines creator Brian Mitsoda as narrative lead and former RPS columnist Cara Ellison as senior writer. It all seemed rather brilliant. It even earned itself the coveted double <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-vampires-are-goofy-dancers-preview">Caldbell</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-love-you-scary-lady-of-the-latest-bloodlines-2-demo">Thumbs-Up</a> from Alice Bee and Brendy (RPS in peace). 
</p>
<p>
Much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-bloodlines-2-explains-thinbloods-and-their-powers">ink</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/malkavians-confirmed-for-bloodlines-2-we-talked-to-brian-mitsoda-on-the-new-clan-reveal">was</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2s-dialogue-system-looks-more-subtle-than-the-original">spilled</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-us-do-a-stealthy-bitey-run-in-this-deep-demo-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Some videos</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-e3-gameplay-video">were made</a>. But then everything went sideways. In August 2020, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-into-2021">announced a delay</a>. Then, they suddenly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">got rid of Mitsoda</a>. Then, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">tore the project from the hands of Hardsuit Labs</a>, who subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-hit-with-layoffs">laid off staff</a>. All this in the name of "doing the game justice". Mitsoda had a different take, as you'd expect. "I was not part of the conversations that led to the decision to delay production, and to my knowledge, there were no delays caused by the Bloodlines 2 narrative development," he wrote at the time of his departure from the project. "I am confident and proud of the work that I and my team put forward." 
</p><p>
Paradox apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-considered-cancelling-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">considered cancelling the game</a>, but eventually handed it over to a secret third party <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">later revealed to be The Chinese Room</a>. Then came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-is-refunding-all-pre-orders-for-bloodlines-2">preorder refunds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">more delays</a>, an interview with us in which Paradox suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">Bloodlines 2 isn't really a Bloodlines game at all</a>, a wholly unforced bit of rake-stepping in which Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">decided</a> and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-controversial-dlc-clans-will-be-in-the-base-game-after-all">undecided</a> to paywall two vampire factions, some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-hours-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-uncloak-a-slick-action-game-but-a-limited-rpg">promising Dishonored comparisons</a>, and finally, our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a>, in which Dominic Tarason deemed the game "an entertaining but flawed vampire brawler wrapped in a compelling mystery story". Whatever you may think of Paradox's treatment of Hardsuit, The Chinese Room appear to have fashioned a decent action bonanza from what they were given, despite being mostly known for games about walking and talking.
</p>
<p>
I was intrigued to play it, but alas, no more. Every server harbouring a copy of Bloodlines 2 has exploded into bony dust. Every screen carrying its image has peeled away from the monitor, folded itself into a pair of batwings and flown out the nearest window. In vain do I direct you towards <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/">Steam</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2">GOG</a> - clicking those store links will simply cause the earth to open and swallow you up. Bloodlines 2 was clearly a project too strange and beautiful for this world.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind</a> has lots of houses. Some of those houses house houses. House Indoril is one of those housed houses, more specifically the one to which Indoril Nevevar, the bloke Morrowind's protagonist is a reincarnation of, belonged. After about two decades of waiting, the modders behind massive project Tamriel Rebuilt are set to start dishing out Indoril membership cards with their next expansion.</p>
<p>Damn, shout the three great houses you can join in base Morrowind, the salespeople of Hlaalu, the grizzled warriors of Redoran, and the spoiled shroom-dwelling sorcerers of Telvanni. There goes our very long window to convince Vvardenfell's most capable magic gauntlet deliverer to join up with us and improve our Sotha street creed.</p>

<p>This next expansion to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morrowinds-tamriel-rebuilt-mod-now-has-as-many-quests-as-the-base-game-and-expansions">ever-growing modding project</a> is set to add in a heartlands section of an all new Orethan region which surrounds the city of Almalexia (AKA Mournhold) on the mainland section of the province, as outlined by the devs in a teaser <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/poison-song-teaser">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"Adding the slice of Orethan Heartlands to the release unlocked one of the holy grails that TR players had been waiting for more than twenty years – the ability to join House Indoril," wrote the wonderfully-named Sultan of Rum. "Much effort had already been spent in the mid-2010s to create a unique character for House Indoril, resulting in the wonderful interactions seen in Roa Dyr in 2019’s Aanthirin expansion. A couple of years ago, however, we consolidated and largely transformed this characterization into a comprehensive design document, including a plan for a full Indoril questline."</p><p>"The addition of the Gorne and Nanaav chapels to the already extant Roa Dyr gives us three major Indoril power centers, which is enough for the first part of their overarching questline," they continued. "All three chapels will have separate relatively low-level questlines introducing you to local issues and the personalities of the ruling Indorils. Indoril Sandil of Gorne – the most forward-thinking and adaptable of the three – may agree to become your patron for real advancement in the venerable House, should you humor his fascination with the legacy of Nerevar in a series of higher-level quests."</p>
<p>As for what you can expect of the faction more generally, the modder specifies that the short answer is a battle to turn around the fortunes of Morrowind's former most powerful party, who've been left shellshocked by a deal that pesky Vivec's struck with the Empire's Tiber Septim. "Seeing the surrender of Morrowind to an outlander warlord as a cataclysm, the surviving Indoril lords have been gripped in doubt and misfunction ever since – mirroring what is happening to their patron, the goddess Almalexia," Sultan of Rum explained. "In their nihilism, they have proven unable to unite in the face of serious challenges to their hegemony, much less effectively counteract the increasingly brazen encroachment by houses Hlaalu and Telvanni."</p>
<p>And here I thought Poison Song, whose creators say they're aiming to be in the process of finalising it in "a matter of months", was gonna be all about belting out that one Alice Cooper tune with your Indoril mates. It's almost as if I should have known that theory was doomed the moment the modders reminded me in their post that Poison Song is the name of a history book in the original Morrowind.</p>
