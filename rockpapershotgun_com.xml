            <p>A work-in-progress version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s first big post-release patch is now testable on Steam, so you can hop in and check out the changes Funcom's making early doors before it rolls out for everyone in a few weeks.</p>
<p>A bunch of the changes the game's devs teased or confirmed during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">their recent AMA </a>and letter to players haven't found their way into the patch, or at least this early version. Though, you'll at least be able to try out PvE in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">the Deep Desert</a>, something folks have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">demanded en-masse</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside pointing folks to the freshly launch Dune: Awakening Public Test Client on Steam, where you can now test out patch 1.1.10.0, Funcom have released <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-public-test-client/">the notes</a> outlining what's in it.</p>
<p>Among the highlights is the news that "the PvE area near the shield wall has been expanded to cover row A, B, C, D and half of E within the Deep Desert." So, you'll be able to check out some Deep Desert PvE, which folks had been calling for to avoid being forced into PvP during Awakening's endgame, when you're hunting for the best gear and resources.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sleepers, we have news!</p><p>Patch 1.1.10.0 is now live on the new Public Test Client.

</p></div>
<p>I have noticed a few folks on the social arguing that this PvE expansion is too big an adjustment - we'll have to see what the consensus is. Outside of that, Funcom have "reduced the frequency of Harkonnen attacks on certain Atreides bases (and vice versa) in Hagga Basin", set up the main menu's play now button to filter out private servers, and made sure "sandworms now linger for a bit around spicefields that have been recently harvested from".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can now use, claim and list items straight to and from the inventory of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-get-ornithopter">Ornithopter</a> in the exchange. There are a bunch of handy minor tweaks to everything from base building to vehicles, combat and the UI. However, if you're hungry for the big PvP changes that the devs have teased, adjustments to the Landsraad, or just the ability to deposit all of your stuff at once, you'll have to keep waiting.</p>

            <p>Yesterdayâ€™s launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU was quiet, yet nonetheless featured a surprise: thereâ€™s also a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/rtx-5050-desktop-gpu-and-laptops/">desktop version of the RTX 5050</a>, set to release (exclusively in third-party garb â€“ thereâ€™s no Founders Edition) in "the second half" of July. Quite the turnaround for the non-laptop XX50 lineage, which was widely assumed extinguished following 2022â€™s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review">RTX 3050</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5050 will replace the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> as the cheapest of Nvidia's current-gen desktop GPUs, starting at $249. Budget buyers will need to make do with 8GB of last-gen GDDR6 VRAM, however, as well as a lighter smattering of CUDA cores: 2,560 to the RTX 5060â€™s 3,840. Thereâ€™s obviously no desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-on-the-rtx-4050s-appeal-has-grown-but-better-laptop-gpus-loom">RTX 4050</a> to compare these specs to, though next to the RTX 3050, it does offer more memory bandwidth even if the total gigabyte count remains the same. Presumably there are also performance advantages, especially where ray tracing is concerned, that the RTX 5050 can glean from its updated Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>'Course, while the RTX 5050 might make for a decent upgrade for current 3050 owners â€“ especially those interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> and frame generation â€“ its $249 price tag does keep it nervily close to the $300 RTX 5060. Which, even with its driver issues, really isnâ€™t a bad 1080p card itself, so weâ€™ll have to see what the 5050 can do to coexist with its more core-rich, wider-bandwidth big brother.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll admit, thereâ€™s a not-small part of me that hopes it can. We can raise eyebrows at the specifications and make "Fnar fnar new GTX 1030" jokes until our typing fingers are worn down to stumps, but there genuinely are vast numbers of PC players who are happy with below-max quality 1080p yet canâ€™t reliably stretch to mid-rangers like the XX60 series. People, in other words, who havenâ€™t been adequately served by the GPU market in years. Arguably since even before the RTX 3050, what with that GPU launching during the dark times of COVID-compounded shortages and price gouging.</p>
<p>Will the RTX 5050 fill that gap? I wonâ€™t know until Iâ€™ve tested one out. But Iâ€™d rather it ends up as a failed attempt, than a repeat of the RTX 40 series' failing to try at all.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-desktop-grade-nvidia-rtx-5050-after-all-and-its-out-next-month]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has a sizeable game update that promises to finally get the game's A-Life system working as intended. For those just joining us - perhaps because you only popped into existence the second you entered my field of view - A-Life is developer GSC Game World's noughties-era buzzword for the pervasive simulation of NPCs throughout the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a>, leading to unpredictable interactions and conflicts and the general sense that things are happening without your input. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Heart Of Chornobyl <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">struggled to implement this at launch</a>, with supposed "roaming" bands of ragamuffins spawning right under the noses of players who promptly took to the Steam reviews to administer some wasteland justice. Our own James Archer had a few warm words in his otherwise positive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a>, calling the game "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off".</p>
<p>Now GSC Game World say they've fixed it. They've also added "Water Electric Tornado" anomalies, together with official mod support via Steam Workshop, Mod.io and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/uk/p/stalker-2-zone-kit">Epic Games Store</a>, a couple of new guns, various quality-of-life tweaks, and the ability to loot mutant parts. Catch some of that in this showcase video.

The A-Life overhaul is the star attraction, here. Please find below some bullet points, meticulously scrounged from the pockets of the dead.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view.
</p>
<p>
- Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.
</p>
<p>
- The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.
</p>
<p>
- Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world's immersion.
</p>
<p>
- Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.
</p>
<p>
- A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.
</p>
<p>
- Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nice balance of tiny tweaks and gargantuan reworkings, there. On the one hand, allowing you to see further to avoid the impression of "pop-in" seems like a matter of moving some decimal places around. Allowing characters "to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end", on the other hand, sounds like it would require the attention of an actual genie. Can my third wish be "add a top-down view and turn the game into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>"?
</p>
<p>
The new guns are the Three-Line Rifle and the Kora handgun. The patch notes don't go into much detail about the new anomaly, but "Water Electric Tornado" seems fairly self-explanatory. As for the quality-of-life rejiggles, you'll now be able to see available artifact slots for armour in the upgrade tab, and there's an unlockable Fix all button in the technician's upgrade menu, to repair all equipped gear. The player stash window is now larger, and there's a reload renewal feature for all of the weapons. 
</p>
