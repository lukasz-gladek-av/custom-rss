            <p>Dambuster Studios are planning to keep their next truckload of undead penned in for a few more years, before opening the big zombie door in early 2028. That's according to some financial docs from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island">Dead Island</a> developers, in which their plans for Dead Island 3 as of the end of March this year are laid bare.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The docs, spotted by a Twitterer with the handle <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">@bogorad222</a>, are Dambuster's annual financial report for the fiscal year that ended on March 31st, 2025. As such, they contain many numbers, but also a section on the studio's current strategy.</p>
<p>Basically, the plan is to now go full steam ahead on Dead Island 3. All Dambuster’s developers are now working on Dead Island 3, to be joined by the studio's QA staff once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Luna and Mac versions are done and dusted. "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace," the report says of DA3, before whipping out that planned release window of some point in 2028's first two financial quarters.</p>
<p>Putting things into real human years, that window likely means the third zombpocalyspse will come by the end of June 2028, assuming things go to the current plan.</p>
<p>This the first concrete news we've gotten about Dead Island 3, unless you count Dambuster teasing it with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243?snr=2___">a Steam post</a> which mentioned they're "already carving out what comes next" back in September. At any rate, you've got plenty of time to read back over our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-island-2-review">Dead Island 2 review</a>, in which Rick Lane judged that while "not worth waiting eleven years for", it's "a breezy, messy adventure that has zero nutritional value, but will fill your bloodstream with yummy, delicious sugar."</p>

            <p>Sorry I'm late, I've got to drop off my non-existent offspring at the place where they learn their times tables soon. Before that, which of you wants to be dunched and bumped into a spin, as mud and discarded metal are flung about like a tornado's hit a scrapyard? This is the question asked by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>'s latest update, which finally gives middle-aged mums and dads a suitable ride in which to wreak havoc.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/553509792472105640?l=english">Early access update five</a> rings in an early Christmas by initiating the minivan era of BugBear's banger basher - that's an MPV if you want to be boring or a people carrier if you're from the good old U of K. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> family bus is dubbed the Grandstar, and it's glorious. Room for seven seats amongst the roll-cage, ample crumple zones between you and the thing you're hitting, and probably a baby seat you want to bring your toddler along.</p>
<p>Aside from the motorhome, which isn't really a daily driver, Wreckfest 2's car list so far has lacked a beefy family wagon to battle the array of muscle cars, saloons, and hatchbacks. As someone who loved the original's Warwagon, Hammerhead, and Hearse, I can assure you that's a good thing. If you're into racing cars that don't resemble bricks, first of all boooooooooooooooo. Second of all, this update's also added in a zippy couple called the Phaser.</p><p>There's a new track dubbed Moorfield, which boasts two muddy race and crash-oriented routes through a farm field that's been pre-ground into a wet and muddy pulp to show off the muddying and tyre sinkage mechanics BugBear have added to every ride. Crashing itself's had a major revamp with this update, with the devs explaining:</p>
<blockquote>In a game like ours, crashing into others should be rewarded. Yet, previously the outcome could feel a bit arbitrary as there were situations in which you were confident you were going to score a good hit on your opponent, only to receive more damage yourself. In this update, we've refactored the attacker/defender detection to make sure we correctly interpret who is the attacker and who is the defender. We've also improved the gameplay logic that determines the outcome of the crash to reward aggressive playing. The gist of the changes is that, like previously, the damage calculations now favour the car with more mass and speed (just more reliably), but when using the normal damage mode the condition of the car is also taken into account.</blockquote>
<p>Rounding things out are the likes of handy tweaks that'll make the livery editor added in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/your-wreckfest-2-ride-merely-adopted-the-rust-and-dents-mine-had-its-scuffage-moulded-by-the-new-crap-it-tool">last month's update</a> easier to use. There are new decals, and you can mirror on different sides of your car or edit them as a group with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Now, I'd better wrap this up and get to wrecking so I can deposit the youngins in good time.</p>

            <p>What's that I hear? Tinkly piano and the crashing of waves. Oh, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first major expansion, which devs Team Cherry have just announced will be coasting up to the shore some point next year. It's called Sea of Sorrow, and as such looks to contain plenty of somber staring into the splashy swell.</p>

<p>Team Cherry announced this forthcoming addition to the metroidvania via the trailer above and <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">a blog post</a>, also noting that the nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow'll be "free for all players". It'll include "new areas, bosses, tools, and more".</p>
<p>The trailer itself's made up of four shots. Two are just some fishing hooks and the shot of Hornet from the update's key art, but in between are a couple that could have more intrigue to them. First's a shot of some creature or object resting atop a wooden platform and tied under a sheet, somewhat resembling a tomb. Then, there's a shot of an ornate, but damaged, glass and gold structure being struck by crackling lightning. It's also littered with what look like discarded bug wings.</p>
<p>What the skong does any of that mean? Well, I'm nowhere near dialled enough into the Hollow Knightverse to speculate, with Team Cherry promising more will be revealed prior to release.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the studio have released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">beta update</a> for the Steam and GOG PC versions of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, to coincide with it being released on some device from an obscure company called Tin Nendo. Nah, I've never heard of them either. The PC update's headlined by support for 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratios and extra controller support. Team Cherry have also sought to reduce any colour banding and made the game pause automatically when you open up your inventory.</p><p>Aside from that, there are some general bug fixes, and one problem on Steam Deck you'll still have to work around for now. "There is an issue with cutscenes showing a 'test pattern' when playing on Steam Deck, which is due to the system defaulting to an incompatible proton version," Team Cherry wrote of the latter. "We are working on a fix for this, but for now it can be worked around by selecting a 'Linux Runtime' version in the compatibility settings, which forces the system to use the Linux-native version of the game."</p>
<p>As usual, instructions as to how to opt into the beta can be found in Team Cherry's post about it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go and buy some Hornet-sized armbands and a rubber ring.</p>
