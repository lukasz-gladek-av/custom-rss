            <p>Access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with federal censorship and media oversight agency Roskomnadzor accusing the platform of distributing content "justifying terrorism" and spreading "LGBT propaganda". According to Russian media reports, the state body said Roblox has become rife with content that can "negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roskomnadzor also cited reports of sexual harassment of children and the sharing of intimate images in their accusations against Roblox. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/04/russias-media-regulator-blocks-roblox-for-justifying-terrorism-and-spreading-lgbt-content">Euronews</a>, Roblox Corporation have issued a response to the ban via a spokesperson. </p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," this statement reads. "We have a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roblox has faced plenty of criticism over how it protects young players in the last few years, with the US state of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144"> bringing a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a> in August, and Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<p>The company behind the blocky game that's actually many games have responded to this by pushing to limit interactions between minors and adults, introducing measures like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-to-roll-out-facial-age-estimation-technology-for-everyone-after-us-prosecutor-dubbed-it-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles">mandatory selfie-based "facial age estimation technology"</a>.</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not." Though, checks of this nature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">haven't always proven to be totally bulletproof</a> when deployed in response to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">the UK's Online Safety Act</a>.</p><p>As far as their accusation of spreading "LGBT propaganda" is concerned, Roskomnadzor have a long history of going after games which they deem to violate the Russian government's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">ultra-conservative views</a>, which have seen draconian laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/russia-supreme-court-outlaws-lgbt-movement">carve away the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people</a> in the country. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-block-steam-game-with-queer-art-in-russia-after-state-censor-attacks-it-for-promoting-non-traditional-sexualities">last month</a>, Valve blocked Flick Solitaire from the Russian version of steam, after Roskomnadzor accused the card game of "promoting non-traditional sexualities".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is ditching its Denuvo anti-tamper software as part of developers' Tango Gameworks transition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">working under new owners Krafton</a>. A fresh patch has been released swapping logos to reflect that switch in management, and you'll need to install it before mid-January if you want the game to stay playable.</p>
<p>Krafton, of course, bought up Tango after the studio's former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced plans to shut it down</a> back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> developers Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom creators Alpha Dog Games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue Hi-Fi Rush <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626833?l=english">patch 10</a>, released earlier today. It makes no changes to the game bits of the game, instead mainly handling the admin of crossing out old publisher logos in favour of Krafton ones.</p>
<p>There is, however, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">one key wrinkle</a> it's well worth you being aware of. The patch has removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-the-state-of-drm-in-2020">Denuvo's controversial anti-piracy/DRM software</a> from the game, with support for it set to end in full as of January 16th. As a result of that, Tango make clear that grabbing patch 10 by that date is mandatory, as "significant changes" made to Hi-Fi Rush's "internal system structure" in the Denuevo removal mean that the game'll no longer run without this latest patch installed after that point.</p><p>"Please note that even after Denuvo is removed, the game’s own anti-tampering features will remain active and will not affect normal gameplay," Tango added, just in case you were wondering if the security guards were being permanently dismissed from Hi-Fi's door.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">our review</a> of the rhythm action romp, Hirun Cryer dubbed it "a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming". "The combat system is surprisingly deep and malleable for any style of player and meshing it gently into the musical beat without putting pressure on the player is a deft touch," he continued. "Its writing and characters might leave a little to be desired, especially when compelling narrative beats are so painfully overlooked, but that doesn’t stop the entire package from being a certified banger."</p>
