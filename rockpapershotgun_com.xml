            <p>Very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tamriel-man-skywind-squeezes-morrowind-into-skyrim">long-in-the-works</a> Elder Scrolls modding project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skywind-releases-long-new-trailer-for-morrowinds-21st-anniversary">Skywind</a> has hit another milestone in its winding road towards an eventual release. The folks behind the mod, which aims to deliver a version of the series' beloved third entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> remade in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, have recruited the final three voice actors they were looking for to fill out the base game's entire roster of characters.</p>
<p>Skywind's still without any kind of release date, meaning it's almost certainly further off than its Oblivion-centric sort of cousin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, which is aiming to arrive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">this year</a>. However, the regular updates we've been getting about it of late are encouraging signs that it will eventually let us into its heart chamber.</p>

<p>The team behind the mod have taken to the socials to announce that they've now cast voices for every character in the base game. "Roughly 300 voice actors are lending their voices to give life to the approximately 3000 NPCs of Vvardenfell," the modders explained, "and we are looking forward to you all hearing them on your adventures."</p>
<p>Given that scale, you can see why it'd take such a gargantuan effort to bring together enough dulcet tones to fill the voice boxes of everyone from Alvis Teri to Zabarbael. The final three characters the Skywinders were looking to find voices for weren't exactly minor roles either. As the team explained in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWpMR5mo-w">most recent showcase of the mod</a> back in May, Dagoth Ur, Vivec, and Yagrum Bagarn were the trio left communicating via silent text.</p>

</span></p><p>Jeff Baker's performance as Dagoth's only one of the most iconic things about the original Morrowind, how tough can it be to fill those god-sized shoes? Well, I'd certainly not want to be the one tasked with bellowing at Nerevar to come and look upon the heart, and Akulakhan, and bring Wraithguard please, because I have need of it. My work certainly wouldn't be god-tier enough to make folks want to stick synthwave behind it to form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-K2rUP86M">funky tunes</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Moon-and-Star, the Skywind team aren't resting on their laurels having ticked this box, and they're still looking for volunteers to help out. If you're interested in that last bit, you can head to <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/volunteer/">the mod's website</a> for more info.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-unofficial-skyrim-remake-of-morrowind-finally-has-a-voice-for-every-last-character-in-vvardenfell]]></content:encoded>
