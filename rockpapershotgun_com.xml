            <p>What in the name of jumping jellybeans is happening to The Maw? Our grizzled regular column summarising all the latest game news is going through some sort of midlife crisis and doesn't know what it wants to be. I can hear it grinding its molars, squelching its many news bladders, and unfurling its long, insipid tendrils. The usual Mawkeeper, Edwin, is away today, so it's up to me to soothe the beast and tell you all the new games being released on PC this week, as well as a hint for some anticipated strategy game news from Paradox Interactive.</p>

<p>I like lists. So let's do this round-up the old-fashioned way. Here's what's coming out.</p>
<h2>Yesterday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Drop Duchy</a> combines the classic tetramino dumping of Tetris with a kingdom managing tactics game. Looks neat!</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/">Best Served Cold</a> is a murder mystery visual novel set in the speakeasy of an alternative history European city (looks pretty much like the popular vision of 1920s United States). You're the bartender turning detective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Today</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Among Us 3D</a> will let you snap the necks of all your best mates and betray the trust of those you love. You cannot spell "friendship" without "end". </li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 7th</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179730/Deck_of_Haunts/">Deck Of Haunts</a> is a maniacal mansion deckbuilder where you design spooks for unsuspecting visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 8th</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paradox are announcing a big new game, as they've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YaZcN-eVta8">teased in a video</a>, calling it "a new era for grand strategy". Fans who have been <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-talks-61-30th-of-april-2025.1738380/">reading the developer diaries</a> for the game codenamed "Project Caesar" are certain it's a new Europa Universalis. We'll have more for you soon. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">The Midnight Walk</a> offers first-person horror with fearful doll heads and some of that not-quite-stop-motion animation all the kids love nowadays. </li>
<li>Sci-fi action adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2787320/Revenge_of_the_Savage_Planet/">Revenge Of The Savage Planet</a> continues its colourful extraterrestrial exploration with four planets to disrupt in co-op. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373090/Yes_Your_Grace_2_Snowfall/">Yes, Your Grace 2: Snowfall</a> is a follow-up to the pixel art kingdom management game that's set in a world inspired by Slavic folklore, where you "collect taxes, hire agents and make difficult decisions". </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/">Sonic Rumble</a> is a Sonic game, so I don't care. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 9th</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/">Anoxia Station</a> is a petrochemical horror strategy about slurping up pools of fuel inspired partly by Frostpunk but with its own distinctly creepy atmosphere. Edwin was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/petro-horror-strategy-game-anoxia-station-makes-frostpunk-look-positively-welcoming">intrigued by its demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>That's your lot</h2>
<p>Okay, I'm done here. As ever, let us know in the comments if there's anything happening this week that we've missed, but you've got your swivelly little eyes on. The Maw is, at least, placated. Hmmm, docile even. Although it's possible what I'm looking at is actually one of its decoy globules, and the true Maw has squeezed out of its enclosure again. I'll, uh, be right back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I once got in a heated debate with Graham over whether the chest-high walls in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series could accurately be called 'massive'. The Gears men are massive, I argued. So it stands to reason that any wall that could provide adequate bullet cover to a massive man must itself be a massive wall. No, said Graham. They're famously normal size walls, hence why the massive men have to squat down like they've just had a bowling ball lobbed at their kidneys. Well, we can finally examine the true scale of these walls - in 4K no less - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears Of War: Reloaded</a>. A "faithfully remastered" version of the 2006 large man <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>, coming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/">to Steam on August 26th</a> this year.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a trailer so enjoy this extremely old one and just imagine it looks nicer. Bit nicer. Little bit nicer. That's it, now you're thinking like a customer!</p>

<p>The announcement was announced by the announcement professionals at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">Xbox Wire</a>. It'll be $40 to buy, and also available on that game subscription service you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections"> may or may not want to support right now</a>. The blog mentions "split screen" although doesn't use the words "local co-op" specifically. Reloaded has "the full breadth of content from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>", itself a remaster with some added bonuses, namely the five extra chapters previously exclusive to the original Windows release. Here are some Gamer Stats for you, gamer:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>My claim to fame is that I'm one of the seven people in the world that had played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Switch_(video_game)#Legacy">Kill Switch</a> prior to the original Gears. That's the 2003 PS2 game that effectively invented the contemporary cover shooter, complete with blindfire. If anything needed a modern remaster, that feels like the far more important project to me, essential piece of gaming history that it is. It's <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/kill-switch-e3s">currently available as abandonware</a> if you're curious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
