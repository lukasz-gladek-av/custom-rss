            <p>RPS's corporate daddy has announced that IGN Live is returning this June. The in-person event aims to fill the void left by E3, with playable demos in LA and livestreams of game reveals and panels for those who can't attend.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now in its second year, IGN Live features games but also announcements about films, television and comic books, with those who pick up tickets able to expect "exclusive reveals, celebrity panels, game demos, photo ops, exclusive merch, gaming stations, screenings, lounges, live episodes of IGN shows" and more, according to the announcement. The event takes place at <a href="https://events.magicboxla.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlPu9BhAjEiwA5NDSA7E0qlQ12-DimO_VnecLCmnEAbmaBe5CYy1OSojTVky-q3oi9jEyihoCxrAQAvD_BwE">Magic Box &amp; The Reef</a> in Downtown LA, and those interested in tickets can <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/">sign up to be notified when they go on sale</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year's IGN Live featured news and announcements from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Razer and Nvidia, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-announcements-from-ign-live-2024">among others</a>.
</p>
<p>RPS has yet to get involved with IGN Live, but we're no strangers to making a mess of events held by our corporate dads. Remember when we turned EGX Rezzed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-miss-rezzed-so-much-that-we-turned-it-into-a-free-tabletop-rpg">into a tabletop game</a>, permamently transformed the TF2 voice cast into a comedy troupe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pax-east">with RPS@PAX</a>, and had Nate share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FoozFca88Y&amp;ab_channel=EGX">the true history of Jason Statham in videogames</a> across several continents? IGN, let us on your stage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Coatsink have announced a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, their pastelcore seaside town-arranger, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-review">the last game Alec Meer ever reviewed for RPS</a>. Until he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review">reviewed Kentucky Route Zero: Act V</a>, a year or so later. If I didn't know better, I'd say Alec had planned that deliberately to screw me up. But I'll forgive him because the KRZ review is very good and thoughtful, and also because the first trailer for Islanders: New Shores is extremely calming. Here you go.</p>

<p>Out summer 2025, New Shores adheres to the first game's formula of carefully plonking down buildings to milk various adjacency bonuses and achieve a certain level score. Over the course of each stage, you unlock more and fancier buildings, each alighting in your inventory with that gentle kiss-pop effect that has become the cosy gaming genre's acoustic signature - a sort of Wilhelm Scream for creators of games about soft sunsets and rake-wielding bunnies making friends.</p>
<p>New Shores contains some new shores, obviously - we can expect "50 dynamic island generators offering endless variety". It also harbours new features. Foremost among them are boons - "one-time power ups unlocked on each stage as you collect points, offering a helping hand that will become vital as you take on the game's tricker levels". These might let you duplicate buildings in your inventory or replace those you've already built, among other "intriguing new twists". Sounds like that might come in handy with the new "advanced scoring systems that reward clever tactics".</p>
<p>There's also a new Sandbox mode (with separate save files), "44 unique building types", seven "stunning island properties", and a juicy photo mode with a spread of filters and a turntable camera setting. Streamers, meanwhile, get Twitch integration which lets viewers vote on building choices.</p>
<p>It all seems like Good Stuff, though I do consider it a little malapropos that one of the islands at the end of the trailer appears to be an active volcano. Did Islanders have volcanoes? I never unlocked any.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
