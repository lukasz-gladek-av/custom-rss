            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developers Embark have shed a bit of light on how their looter-shooter changed after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">shifting away from the free-to-play business model</a> back in 2024. Apparently, it made Arc "drastically easier" to design, in the sense that the Swedish studio felt less pressure to turn players into whales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That's my admittedly rather blunt reading of the latest Arc Raiders <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">behind-the-scenes development video</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embark-says-moving-from-free-to-play-made-designing-arc-raiders-drastically-easier">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Embark's previous multiplayer FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> was free-to-play, and Arc Raiders was due to follow in its footsteps, but as design director Virgil Watkins explains in the video, this made it harder to "respect the player's time" when plotting out Arc's extraction shooting.
</p>
<p>
"In free-to-play, you need to, in some ways, make things a little stickier than they would be otherwise, take a little more time, a little more grind just so players are more incentivised to stay in and stick into those loops and keep playing your game, and ideally are incentivised and inspired to spend money on that game," he says.
</p>
<p>
"For this type of title, it made it kind of hard to respect the player's time in some of these areas around crafting or sessions and things like that. We were almost like 'slow down a little bit'. It felt a little bad so as soon as that decision came down, it made us able to make things take the amount of time that felt appropriate in a lot of ways."
</p><p>
Watkins offers some examples of how Embark changed Arc Raiders after deciding to charge for it upfront. "Crafting no longer has timers on it that you need to wait out or the amounts of things we are asking you to collect are a little more rational," he comments. "Effort and outcome match each other a little more precisely." 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the video, Embark CEO and founder Patrick Söderlund makes the obvious point that Arc would have landed more players upfront as an F2P game. "A free-to-play game would attract a lot of players and we can maybe get tens of millions of players for a while," he says. "But as we started building what would become the rebirth of Arc Raiders, the team started to ask me questions - was free-to-play the right model for us?"
</p>
<p>
If Arc is now an old-timey "premium" release, it's still not worlds away from many F2P games in its reliance on grinding resources out of the maps. It also has microtransactions - cue <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-celebrates-the-launch-of-a-new-region-in-the-north-line-update-with-microtransactions-price-cuts">a recent player controversy</a> about pricing - which are ubiquitous among videogames today, but are more prevalent in F2P releases for obvious reasons. 
</p>
<p>
"It's helped a lot, but on the other side, launching it with a price point, we still need ways to monetise that doesn't feel predatory," Watkins concedes of the switch to upfront payments in the video. "That's also been an interesting challenge."
</p><p>
At the time of writing, Embark are gearing up for the first Arc Raiders expedition. This basically lets you reset much of your progression - including your inventory, blueprints, player level, skill points, quest progress - by sending your Raider off to join a caravan of pioneers, once you've offered up sufficient resources for the trip.</p>
<p>Expeditions operate according to an eight-week schedule, with the first one due to "leave" on 21st December. In return for packing your current character off to the frontier, you'll get increased XP gain, Scrappy materials, bonus skill points, more and cheaper weapon repairs, and more stash space. It's a novel way of characterising the routine live service practice of bumping players back to square one, both for "prestige" and so that we have an incentive to climb the ladder once again.

            <p>Seems it’s a good day to be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> player: in addition to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-buffs-a-bunch-of-guns-nerfs-tongues-and-dials-down-the-drawbacks-of-using-scopes">buff-happy Into the Unjust 5.0.0 patch</a> that launched earlier, developers Arrowhead have shared an update on their efforts to shave down the co-op shooter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-does-helldivers-2-have-such-a-bloated-install-size-on-pc-old-hard-drives-says-dev">mammoth install size</a>. And it’s not so much a shaving as a fully fuelled chainsawing, high vis vests be damned. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372">Steam post</a> explains, there’s now a beta build, available to try, that cuts the 154GB game down to 23GB – a 131GB (!!!) reduction. That’s like surgically removing an entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> that was growing out of its back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There’s more good news for owners of mechanical HDDs, the aged technology of which – versus new, cool, handsome SSDs – was lightly blamed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">previous dev blog</a> for the bloat that Helldivers 2 had developed. In short, the fear was that by removing duplicated assets, assumed to be vital in keeping the game playable on slow-loading hard drives, Arrowhead’s measures would render older and lower-spec PCs unable to make the dive. This, so says the new blog, turned out to be a miscalculation, with HDD users only expected to endure a few more seconds of loading screens. Not, it seems, an effective loss of support.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to say that our worst case projections did not come to pass," the post reads. "These loading time projections were based on industry data - comparing the loading times between SSD and HDD users where data duplication was and was not used. In the worst cases, a 5x difference was reported between instances that used duplication and those that did not. We were being very conservative and doubled that projection again to account for unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>"Now things are different. We have real measurements specific to our game instead of industry data. We now know that the true number of players actively playing HD2 on a mechanical HDD was around 11% during the last week (seems our estimates were not so bad after all). We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p>
<p>So the forest of identical trees wasn’t at fault after all. Sounds like everyone, myself included, owes those bark textures an apology.</p>
<p>It’s not a given though, that the lightweight 23GB build will arrive for all players as-is. A beta is a beta, which potentially means bugs, crashes, or indeed, longer load times than Arrowhead’s calculations predict. Even so, you can test it for yourself right now – opting in is just a matter of opening Helldivers 2’s Properties menu in Steam, navigating to the Betas tab, whacking "prod_slim" (without the quotes) in the Private Betas field, and selecting the slim build from the dropdown menu. To opt out, use the same menu to select "None", assuming you haven’t filled the last remaining 131GB of drive space up with high-resolution photos of redwoods in the meantime.</p>
