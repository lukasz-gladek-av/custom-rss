            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) are set to launch an industry-wide union of video game workers in the U.S. and Canada at this year's GDC. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) will bring together "video game artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The union’s mission is to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, but also to build large-scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry," say the CWA. "Their first issue campaign will be around layoffs – given the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-third-of-developers-think-generative-ai-is-a-negative-for-the-games-industry-says-new-survey">1 in 10 video game developers were laid off in 2024</a>, many video game workers have been mobilized to organize. And now they can! Workers will be sharing around a petition to address the industry-wide layoffs and hope to gain widespread support while at GDC".</p>
<p>If you're attending GDC, you'll be able to pick up a zine they've put together, which includes "UVW-CWA’s mission statement, FAQs, an op-ed on direct-join unionism from CODE-CWA Senior Campaign Lead Emma Kinema, and member quotes". Otherwise, the zine will be available from the <a href="https://code-cwa.org/">CODE-CWA's website.</a></p>
<p>From the zine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights, setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organizers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labor movement."</p></blockquote>

            <p>
Forthcoming life sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the plucky (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">genAI-ridden</a>) David to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s Goliath - will cost $40 at its early access launch, the developers have announced. What's more, "all updates and DLCs will be provided for free" until the game hits 1.0, according to translated commentary from game director Hyungjun Kim. 
</p>
<p>
This is being styled as a gift unto the gamers, and another way of tempting them from the clutches of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, whose DLC packs commonly sell for full-game prices. The other way of looking at it is that of course early access "updates and DLC" should be free. The point of early access is that you're paying for an unfinished game with the expectation that it'll eventually be worth the money. Also, what's the difference between an update and a DLC? My my, Inzoi, what a can of worms you have opened.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news arrives care of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8">a global showcase</a> last night, which also breaks down the new life sim's early access development - it's launching on 28th March. We can expect four major updates this year, together with new outfits and furniture every three months. Here's an approximate rundown. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Update 1, May</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mod kit (Maya, Blender)
</p>
<p>
Changes to weight, muscle adjustment
</p>
<p>
In-game cheat codes
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Outfit updates
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 2, August</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ghost play
</p>
<p>
Swimming &amp; pools
</p>
<p>
More resources for edit city
</p>
<p>
AI build mode
</p>
<p>
Freelancer jobs
</p>
<p>
Improvements to text messages &amp; skills
</p>
<p>
Parenting improvements
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 3, October</strong>
</p>
<p>
Family time
</p>
<p>
Hotkey customization
</p>
<p>
Build mode--adjust object size
</p>
<p>
New furniture
</p>
<p>
Moving homes UX improvements
</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 4, December</strong>
</p>
<p>
Memory system
</p>
<p>
Move cities
</p>
<p>
Interaction responses based on traits
</p>
<p>
Build mode improvements and new furniture
</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
New outfits
</p>
<p>
Indoor temperature
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In terms of competing with The Sims, the key addition is probably that mod kit in May. InZoi will need a healthy community of tinkerers if it's to usurp the EA colossus (or perhaps just prosper alongside it - why do I insist on pitting them against each other? Why am I like this?)</p>
<p>I'm also quite interested in the ability to play a ghost - there are 16 ways a character can die in Inzoi, and if you have bad karma when you pop your clogs you'll linger on as a spectre, thwarting the birth of new Zois by, as far as I can tell, contributing to the neighbourhood population cap.
</p>
<p>
Returning to the point about the unfairness of charging for early access DLC - obviously, game development isn't that cut and dried. Perhaps a developer runs into unexpected costs that require them to slap a price tag on an early access update. Perhaps they decide they want to add a player-requested feature they haven't scoped for. Perhaps they really needed to charge more for the base early access game but didn't feel they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Still, I don't like the dilution of the early access concept here. In general, it feels increasingly like developers and publishers view early access as simply a variant of the live service game, with more purchaseables being added over time.

            <p>What's the pettiest reason you began to distance yourself from an old friend? I once casually suggested to a mate that I found toast more filling than bread, which prompted them to bang on for far too long about how I was actually wrong, since the act of toasting necessarily diminishes the structure of bread or somesuch. I'm not sure whether that's true and I don't care. I was speaking my truth about toast and you undermined it. Jog on, toast denier.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s new Ghoul Within update is 18.9 GB, which may well conclusively prove that searing ghoulification actually ends up with the victim weighing more than they did previously. I wish I'd known this at the time of my yeasty bust-up, because I'd have probably tried to make the same argument about toast. We might have stayed mates then. Maybe we could have played Fallout 76 together? Why, that's the subject of this very <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/">Steam blog</a>! Incredible.</p>

<p>Your journey to "Ghoulification" begins with a new questline named "Leap Of Faith" in the Savage Divide. Do that, and you'll be able to transform into a Ghoul, complete with 30 new perks and two new abilities. Glow increases your maximum health depending on how radiated you are, and Feral confers combat buffs and penalties depending on how many drugs you've eaten.</p>
<p>Being a Ghoul will negatively affect your interactions with factions like the Brotherhood Of Steel and lock you out of certain questlines. If you're starting to feel isolated, you can either don a disguise or reverse your ghoul-hood altogether. This is permanent, though. If you want to become a ghoul once again, you'll need to cough up 1000 atoms - about £8/$10.</p>
<p>Alongside a new Level 50 Character Boost and a new event starting April 29th - "The Big Bloom" - the patch notes also detail a host of balancing tweaks. I'm particularly fond of the helpful mundanity in "adjusted some Perk names for better alphabetical sorting". The game's also 75% off on Steam right now, in case you aren't saving for the rumoured imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a>. It's… actually only slightly more expensive than that ghoul reversal charge. Love to be a fan of videogames in 2025. Probably just play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a>, innit. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Pocketpair have taken a break from their packed schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">saloon brawls with Mario's lawyers</a> to update their monster-catching <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game with a new Crossplay mode, together with new storage options, a Photo Mode, a cosmetic armour system, and a new Drafting Table feature. That and a multitude of smaller tweaks and fixes.
</p>
<p>
Witness the crossplaying in the below trailer, in which a base-vandalising Astegon gets its bell rung by a group of visitors presumably running foreign hardware. That'll learn 'em to step on my Lamballs.

</p>
<blockquote><p>
・Crossplay!</p> <p>Cross-play is now available across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
・Global Palbox </p> <p>Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!
</p>
<p>
・Dimensional Pal Storage</p> <p>A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.
</p>
<p>
・Cosmetic Armour System!</p> <p>You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character's appearance without affecting armour stats!
</p>
<p>
・Photo Mode</p> <p>Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.
</p>
<p>
・Drafting Table</p> <p>Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!
</p>
<p>
・Dedicated Servers for Mac 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Legal fisticuffs with Nintendo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> updates aside, Pocketpair have recently gotten into games publishing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">Their first collaboration is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios</a>, the people behind Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU. The move into publishing doubles as a spiritual dividend for Palworld players who now look with horror upon their sprawling empires of Pokélike slaves. Rest easy, ye fretful caPaltalists - your blood money is being used to fund a new generation of indie games.
