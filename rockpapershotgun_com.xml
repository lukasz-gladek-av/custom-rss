            <p>Among the trio of new hardware devices <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve just announced</a> for 2026 – which also include the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">redesigned Steam Controller</a> – the new Steam Machine is probably the most surprising. Mainly because the original Steam Machines, a series of partner-built SteamOS mini-PCs, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-machines-arent-exactly-flying-off-the-shelves-but-valve-are-sticking-with-linux">sank like rectangular stones</a> upon launching in 2015.</p>
<p>Designed and built entirely in-house, the new model is a very different proposition, though it’s not so much the updated hardware that has Valve believing it’s time to give the Steam Machine another chance. According to engineers Yazan Aldehayyat and Pierre-Loup Griffais, the biggest problem faced by those doomed Machines was one that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton software</a> has solved: a lack of SteamOS-compatible games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think a big part of it was that the software was not quite ready," Aldehayyat replied when I asked what went wrong in 2015. "We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows."</p>

<p>Proton predates the Steam Deck by a few years, but the handheld was the first major device to show what it could do, allowing punters to play the majority of their already-owned Steam games right out of the box. During the days of the first Steam Machines, the only reliably-running games – unless you got lucky with other, less integrated compatibility tools like Wine – were those that had been manually ported from Windows to Linux, on which SteamOS is based. That meant a relatively tiny library compared to the thousands upon thousands of Steam games that the Deck could run at launch, all without needing any significant input from developers or publishers.</p><p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games... all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library.</p>
<p>"Developers were kind of stuck between the equation of 'Do I want to do a bunch of work to port my game? But there's not an audience for it that justifies this work yet.' So it was a little bit of a bootstrapping problem.</p>
<p>"The catalogue wasn't quite there, but then once we released Proton, we started to see that tendency invert."</p>

<p>SteamOS still lacks native support for non-Steam launchers like Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games launcher. But, the Steam Deck has also shown that it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">fairly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">easy</a> to get these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">working</a> regardless – in turn, further expanding the new Steam Machine’s compatibility umbrella over games that would never have played ball with the older models. And although an increasingly common blockade for the Steam Deck has been its struggles with squeezing adequate performance out of technically demanding games, Valve are sure that the brawnier Steam Machine won’t fall short on speed.</p><p>"For Steam Deck, we had a lot of work to do on performance, but it was kind of a different angle, right? Like it was power efficiency and stuff like that,” Griffais explained. "So even around the Steam Deck release, if you're running SteamOS on hardware like that, maybe the performance wouldn't be exactly on par as it would be on desktop. But [for the new Steam Machine] we've done a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff, and now we expect that all the same performance advantages are presented in more discrete GPU form factor."</p>
<p>Although I wouldn’t call the Steam Machine a powerhouse, it’s a damn sight quicker than the Deck: while Valve’s engies were telling me all this, I was using it to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> at 4K (upscaled with FSR 3 in Performance mode) on a combination of Medium settings and Low ray tracing. Between Proton and this added muscle, the new Steam Machine might be a few months off, yet it's hard not to agree that it'll likely avoid the compatibility woes that – in Valve’s eyes – doomed its predecessors.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s got a fresh patch and it generally focuses on making the schoolgirl spookfest easier for those who want that option, or just aren't too fussed about fights. There's a new "casual" difficulty option and the chance to a certain sections during a new game plus run, plus some wider tweaks that should make the game less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-loves-combat-so-much-it-feels-like-its-fighting-itself">combat-intensive</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/news/us/en/patch-note_v110">patch notes</a>
, the "casual" difficulty will be offered as an option when you start both regular and new game plus playthroughs, as well as popping up if you hit game over multiple times on any of the more severe difficulties. Meanwhile, the option to skip the section that begins once you pass through the a door after solving the mural puzzle during a new game plus run is seemingly aimed at new game plus folks who just want to see all of the endings.</p>
<p>If you opt to skip, things'll resume when Hinako awakens at the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time, with endings and branching story paths unaffected. Naturally, though, you won't have picked up any items in the skipped bit and three achievements tied to beating the game on different difficulties won't be unlockable for that playthrough.</p>
<p>Dipping into the patch's wider changes, you'll find stuff with similar purposes. The numbers of "unskippable combat encounters" and enemies have been dialled down, while Hinako regenerates stamina more quickly. She'll also take less damage on the hard difficulty and hold off on saying her line after beating a foe for a bit longer.</p><p>Taking a quick peek through the smattering of general bug fixes, "fixed bugs across multiple levels where clumps of flesh do not spawn" is a snigger-worthy one. Those pesky clumps of flesh, not doing what they're told. Shu should also no longer clone himself and monsters shouldn't randomly stop moving as much.</p>
<p>If you've not already, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">Oisin's review</a> of Silent Hill f for a verdict on it. They experienced some Scooby-Doo-style leg spinning, so it sounds like the horror flick at least does well on the zoinks-o-meter.</p>
