<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release date remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xbox-stop-trying-to-make-silksong-happen-its-not-going-to-happen">shitpost</a>, beyond that it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-release-date-confirmed-for-2025">fall in 2025</a>, but we do at least now know that you'll be able to play it in September, as long as you go to one particular museum in Melbourne, Australia. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The museum in question is the National Museum of Screen Culture, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a>. A playable version of Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> will apparently be on display there from September 18th, together with materials from the game's development. Will the exhibited version be the finished version, and if so, can we assume that Silksong will be on sale before then? Reader, your guess is as good as mine. Team Cherry do love to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed-because-its-gotten-quite-big">lead their fans a merry dance</a>. There are gods and oceans more knowable than Team Cherry. There are fairy queens less fey. Mind you, it doesn't help that people keep coming up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">conspiracy theories about cake</a>.
</p>
<p>
Silksong will form part of an exhibition called Game Worlds, which features levels from 30 games including World Of Warcraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neopets">Neopets</a>. Co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell have this to say: "From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"

They've also shared the above sheet of the aforesaid hundreds of sprite animations. I'm pretty sure my body isn't capable of that many sprites. I risk putting my hip out if I go over 30. Anyway, I wonder how many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> players are even now booking airline tickets. Perhaps the secret agenda here is to get more gamers into museums?

            <p>
"A free-wheeling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> road trip that pushes all the right buttons," was Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keep-driving-review">verdict on Keep Driving</a> this February. I am thankful for Brendy for many things in life, but seldom more so than today, for he has supplied me with an easy opening segue: there are even more of those buttons to push now, for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/keep-driving">Keep Driving</a> has been updated with gamepad support. 
</p>
<p>
The update also introduces a casino minigame for the El Cobra location, and a new location in the form of Junkyards, where you will presumably find leftover bits for your car. Wash that down with some borderless fullscreen, campsite sidestops where you can rest for free, new decals, and the ability to refuel jerrycans at gas stations. Witness it all in motion in the below celebratory trailer.

<p>
I was happy that Brendy got to review Keep Driving, because Brendy is often tasked with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">reviewing car games that are cruel to him</a> - car games in which the car is secretly an incontinent cougar that pisses all over your dreams, even as you strive to render it roadworthy. Keep Driving, by contrast, is "a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline". My goodness, that sounds almost uplifting. Barely any pissy cougars at all!
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208281?l=english">a post on Steam</a>, developers YCYJ Games assert that the gamepad support scrubs up well on Steam Deck, but stress that "if you play on Steam deck, make sure to not lock your FPS for best possible performance". This is the first of four planned updates for 2025: there's a "smaller content update" coming in May,  some additional new bits and localisation features in late summer, and console support by winter. 
</p>
<p>
The roadmap post concludes with some reminiscences on "how important it is to appreciate the fleeting beauty of the world, and the fleeting beauty people you stumble upon, and the fleeting beauty of now". Which is both on-brand and atypically poignant for a roadmap post. Imagine if every Call Of Duty changelog ended by telling the player to touch grass and remember the taste of strawberries.
