            <p>Hi everyone, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has been delayed again. It's now set to arrive on November 19th, 2026, about half a year on from the May 26th date it'd landed on following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">last delay</a>. November 19th, 2026 will apparently be a Thursday, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This latest delay was announced by Take-Two and Rockstar as part of the former's latest financial report. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," reads a tweet from Rockstar. The tweet begins "hi everyone", which isn't funny, but my evening brain's finding it so, mainly because it makes the post read a bit like a substitute teacher announcing that the regular teacher's stuck in traffic until November 19th, 2026, so can you all please react to that news without erupting into complete anarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoken to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">IGN</a> about the delay, which sees the much-hyped crime/love game slip a whole year from its original autumn 2025 release goal. "Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience," he said. Asked what's changed since he said he was confident in that original 2025 goal, the exec added: "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p> <div>

<p>He's also chatted with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. In that discussion Zelnick stressed that Take-Two "feel really good" about the new date, adding that even though it's a year away, the company's date setting's "not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out". In the meantime, the exec said, Rockstar'll keep on plugging with GTA Online so people can get their crime/not as much love fix.</p><p>So, there you go. This latest delay comes on a day which has seen protests outside of Take-Two's London offices and Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ in response to the studio firing around 30 UK-based workers for "gross misconduct", as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Edwin reported</a>. The IWGB Union have claimed that this was done as retaliation against an attempt to unionise, while Rockstar have since asserted that the fired staff shared "confidential information on a public forum".</p>
