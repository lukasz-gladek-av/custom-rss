            <p>If you had been planning to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-ww2">Call Of Duty: WW2</a> - an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> widely agreed by critics to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-review">among the games released in 2017</a> - maybe do not do that, for the moment, because certain versions of Call Of Duty: WW2 may randomly show you pornography, send you insulting notepad messages and, at worst, fill your computer with ransomware.</p><!--more-->
<p>As written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/">PCGamer</a>, Activision have taken the Xbox PC version of the World War shooter offline amid social media reports of a remote code execution exploit, or RCE - this being a vulnerability that lets a hacker meddle with a game's code from afar using the developer's own programming language.</p>
<p>WW2 players have been posting <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940639088576811516">screens</a> and <a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053">footage</a> of peculiar sights and sounds during recent gunshooting expeditions. One message references lawyers <a href="https://www.msk.com/newsroom-news-2847">who were involved in an Activision lawsuit</a> against German companies selling cheat codes for Call Of Duty games. Activision have yet to confirm or deny that these disruptions are due to a RCE, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085">stating only</a> that they've yanked the game's online while they address an "issue".</p>
<p>Call Of Duty: WW2 recently released on Microsoft's PC Game Pass service, so the apparent hack is precisely timed. The game is still available via Steam and Battle.net - it's unclear whether those versions are also affected, but I would probably hold off loading them up to find out.</p>
<p>Among those commenting on the situation is VX-Underground, a white hat hacker group akin to the Ghostbusters, who claim to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vx-underground">the largest online repository of malware</a>. The group's admin Smelly has posted <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1940889734269501446">a longer speculative post</a> explaining why the Call Of Duty: WW2 hullabaloo is probably an RCE situation.</p>
<p>Smelly shares concerns that the attackers are "capable of deploying information stealer malware, a RAT (remote administration tool), or ransomware". But they conclude based on the shared videos and screens that "thankfully, it appears this attacker is primarily interested in memeing and fucking with people." What japes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know as and when Activision comments properly on any of this. In the meantime, maybe resist the call of the Western Front. Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3659990/hatenet/">hate.net</a> instead. The bots there aren't exactly friendly, but they will not try to encrypt your computer and charge you a bucket of Bitcoin for the unlock key.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-offline-amid-hacking-claims-after-it-starts-messing-with-pcs-and-citing-random-lawyers]]></content:encoded>

            <p>How do you sort of resurrect a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game that's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">blown up</a> by a feature creeper before it could be released? Well, in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, it looks like one of the answers is going to be a new mode in another Minecrafty sandbox game.</p>
<p>Yep, amid much chatter about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">potential Hytale revivals</a> since the news of its cancellation and Hypixel Studios' impeding closure broke last month, the devs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-vintage-story">Vintage Story</a> are trying to make sure that at least some of the game's spirit lives on.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Perhaps we can put together a small sub-project within our team of developers to bring out an additional game mode for Vintage Story that can at least in part deliver on the vision of what Hytale set out to become," wrote VS team lead Tyron in <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/hytale-fans-you-are-very-welcome-here-r412/">a blog post</a>, not long after learning of Hytale's fate.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/">latest post</a> is an update confirming that that team is pressing go on plans to at least "attempt" to make that adventure mode a reality. "The new mode would be departing significantly in aesthetics, setting and game mechanics compared to Vintage Story," he wrote, "More focused towards fantasy and adventure/rpg-y compared to the gritty, realism-based nature of the current experience. Personally, I would love to see some Elves and Dwarves in there.</p>
<p>"For the time being it would ship alongside Vintage Story at no additional cost, but in the purely hypothetical scenario where it really takes off we could spin it off into a fully separate game," Tyrion went on. "We'll be very open about it, release early and the sub-team will be given significant agency over development direction and communication style with players. There will also be some areas where the goals of both teams will intersect and both projects will benefit, such as combat, improved enemy AI or better NPCs in general. For existing players - rest assured, the aesthetics and game mechanics of Vintage Story will remain true to its original vision."</p>
<p>Tyron outlined that they're currently going through job applications to be part of that sub-team. "We'll be starting small (3 to 4 people) and expand once the project shows merit and gathers interest," he explained. "A small team might be slower, but is also much more manageable, more effective and can pivot quicker. Slow growth allows us to fund this truly for the long term. And thankfully, we can re-use a lot of the Vintage Story ecosystem."</p>
<p>He's since updated the post responding to some concerns Vintage Story fans have raised, outlining that work on that game will still continue and that he doesn't believe spending the resources this new mode will require on Vintage Story's existing development would be a net positive for that project. </p>
<p>"Vintage Story might have never seen the day of light without Hytale," he added in closing. "Now it is my turn to hand them an olive branch. It is the least that I can do. I know many of you have a significant emotional investment in Vintage Story, I am well aware of it. I will be careful to not lose sight of that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vintage-storys-devs-are-trying-to-save-some-of-cancelled-hytales-soul-by-turning-it-into-an-adventure-mode]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But SKG's Ross Scott says these are "bad faith arguments"</p>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">last week</a>, meaning EU policymakers may soon be debating whether developers and publishers should have the option to render online games unplayable by shutting down their servers. Video Games Europe, a trade association who represent publishers and devs, have responded by outlining why they think that choice should stay on the table.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how any proper debates on the topic go, but the response is worth reading if you're still trying to decide where exactly you stand on the issue YouTuber Ross Scott and <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">have been campaigning about</a> since Ubisoft pulled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Video Games Europe, whose <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">board</a> is currently chaired by Warner Bros Games publishing senior vice president Hester Woodliffe, <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">argue</a> that the call to shut up shop "must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable."</p>
<p>"We understand that it can be disappointing for players," they continue, "but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable," the statement goes on. "In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."</p>
<p>The body, whose board also includes representatives from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, have published a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf">longer doc</a> alongside that statement, going into more detail about the effects of requiring publishers to either maintain online support while folks are still playing, or come up with an end-of-life plan that leaves the game still playable.</p>
<p>They make ten points in total, two centred around "player safety", three about the potential "impact on companies", and five concerning a possible impact on the intellectual property rights companies have to their games.</p>
<p>The main concerns boil down to the stuff you'd expect: money and the lack of control publishers would have over community-run private servers, were they to wind down support and 'hand things over' to players that wished to keep a game going. In addition to any bottom line impact, they say there would need to be a new legal framework for people doing things with games without direct support or oversight from the company who made the game, and are still somewhat liable for it.</p>
<p>Right now, there are plenty of grey areas that, as we regularly see with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">modding</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/emulation">emulation</a>, don't tend to jive with the sort of legal surety many companies want, at least in terms of protecting themselves from potential action or headaches over products.</p>
<p>It's stuff Stop Killing Games will need to have strong answers for if they hope to succeed in turning their campaign's goals into concrete laws or rules. To be fair to the consumer group, <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the FAQ section</a> of their website does address or outline viewpoints on a bunch of areas that Video Games Europe has raised here, as well as citing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> Sport and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a> as examples of games whose online support was ended "in a responsible way".</p>

<p>Scott has also put out a video response to VGE's statement. In it, he goes through the shorter statement, but not the full document, outlining ways he believes these concerns or issues could be addressed - for example by adding to electronic user license agreement docs.</p>
<p>Scott claimed that the points made by VGE are "bad faith arguments", and has called on eligible supporters to contact members of European parliament about the campaign. Scott stresses in the video that he won't be the one debating this directly with EU politicians and groups like VGE, because he's not eligible to be the EU campaign's official spokesperson.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how it all plays out, but I for one look forward to reviews of The Crew potentially having to be read out in European parliament.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group]]></content:encoded>
