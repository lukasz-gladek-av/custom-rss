I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne</a> is one of those games that will always be at least just a little bit relevant, in some shape or form. There are other indie games I'd rather play more than it from its era, but it kind of feels like the best representation of that period in indie games too. Throwback pixel art, a unique spin on both bullet hells and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, a bangin' soundtrack, it's got the right mix of things to help it stand the test of time. And here we are now, the game approaching its 10th anniversary, arriving with a new update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
To be specific, it's a new beta build, so it's only there if you want to try it out, but it is available right now. Don't go expecting massive features or additions or anything though, this is a quality of life update. To that end, here's what it includes! For starters there's now 60 or 120fps support, for those of you that care about that sort of thing (look, most games just don't need 60fps, alright).

There's also new aspect ratios, and a new controls menu too, but to find out the exact changes there you'll have to take a look for yourself. "Oh, and a new Melting loading screen tip", the post rounds off, alongside a very cool emoji wearing sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
If you want access to this update, your steps are pretty simple: right click on Nuclear Throne in your Steam library, click properties, then betas, then select "openbeta_win64", and Bob's your uncle, the update is ready and waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
Vlambeer explain in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/242680/view/528724684296945991?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the update that they plan to add all these improvements into the main game too, as well as more than what's mentioned above, so don't feel like you have to rush for it.

        <p>OK, but please do a martial art now and then, Sloclap</p>

            <p>Sloclap’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-foot-to-ball-visualisation">foot-to-ball</a> game Rematch is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">very good</a>, and has been doing very well, with over three million sales to date, but some of us yet grieve for a time when kicks were reserved for torsos and limbs. Which is to say, some of us have been hoping that Sloclap might return to the martial arts realm in which it has hitherto made waves.</p> <!--more-->
<p>If it happens, it will not happen in the form of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> 2 or even a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a>, Sloclap’s chain-punching debut. For you see, creative director Pierre Tarno is of the opinion that “chasing safe bets is a death sentence” and that "gamers are on the lookout for new, original experiences." He’s got better things to do than develop sequels, and I’m sure no video game publishers brandishing huge sacks of rubies will persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>That’s from a new Edge interview sliced into sandwich-sized slablets by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/as-rematch-fires-past-3-million-players-devs-say-they-werent-planning-to-follow-up-their-cult-kung-fu-game-sifu-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence/">Gamesradar</a>. According to Tarno, he pitched Rematch after Sloclap finished Absolver, but the studio were too small at the time to handle more than one project, and Sifu won the coin toss. Still, Sloclap were already prototyping the football game almost a year before Sifu’s release.</p>
<p>Again, Rematch has done very well. Extraordinarily well, for a game braving a sports genre dominated by essentially one series, the artist formerly known as FIFA. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of it – you can feel the dev’s past games in the tuned-up leather-walloping SFX, which make EA Sports FC seem anodyne. I also enjoy that, for all the souped-up holographic stadiums, each match is basically a neighbourhood kickabout with loosened rules and no referee.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn’t mind playing another Absolver, or some other, very stylish experience in which feet are a means of speedy jaw removal rather than being used to abuse innocent, air-filled orbs. Hmm, what other things can you kick? I do kick this computer now and then when I'm doing my tax returns, but I'm not sure you could get a whole game out of that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sifu-2-says-rematch-dev-because-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence]]></content:encoded>
