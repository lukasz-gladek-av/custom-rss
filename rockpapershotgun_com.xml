            <p>I was rubbing along pretty well in House Of Necrosis before I hurled a vial of unidentified black serum at a squashy purple Devourer. I was hoping the serum would be some kind of poison - I mean, come on, an unidentified black serum? You wouldn't pour that on your chips. It turned out to be an XP potion, which transformed the Devourer into a Foul Devourer - still squashy, still purple, but with much sturdier defence.</p>
<p>I managed to recover some of the accidentally donated XP by lobbing a cheeky hex, but not enough to boost the stopping power of my homely pawnshop knife and pistol. So down I went in a pool of that special red serum the billionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history">like to drink</a> when they're feeling mortal.</p><!--more-->
<p>Imagine if this had happened while you were playing the original Resident Evil on PS1. Imagine hurling a bottle of unspecified weirdness into the blindspot immediately after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntFBVXqPg">the Hunter's first appearance</a>, and hearing a cheery level-up chime. You'd have ripped the power cable out of the wall. You'd have sworn to track down Shinji Mikami and make him eat his own socks. Unless, that is, you'd already played a few Mystery Dungeon games, which do this kind of nonsense all the time.</p>

<p>I described House Of Necrosis as "OG Resident Evil but turn-based" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-battlefield-6-fends-off-an-onslaught-of-cool-indie-rpgs-strategy-games-horror-games-and-piss-simulators">the latest Mawmouth</a>, which isn't inaccurate but (as reader SeekerX pointed out) omits plenty. This neato <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is a tribute to both Capcom and Spike Chunsoft. It sees you exploring a zombie mansion made up of grid-based floor layouts full of randomly distributed enemies, treasures and traps. You've got to find the next floor while sprucing your stats and gathering items. </p><p>It's a game of pleasurable/maddening occult surprises. For example, I was spared death at the claws of an AOE-slopping boss monster by a teleport trap, which whisked me off to a room stocked with green herbs. Thankfully, these do exactly what you're expecting. For people who can't get enough of that old-timey survival horror, there's also a hub environment with proper tank controls.</p>
<p>House Of Necrosis is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/">out now on Steam</a>, still has a demo at the time of writing, and seems jolly, going by the early user reviews. I did enjoy my brief time with the Foul Devourer, though I feel like the game's devout 32-bit murkiness may wear out its welcome, next to the crisper anime stylings of regular Mystery Dungeon. Shame it doesn't appear to be Steam Deck Verified - this feels like it would make a fine portable play. You can also find developer Warkus on <a href="https://warrrkus.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> - they're certainly fond of fifth generation consoles.</p>
