            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was munching crisps while watching a showcase of upcoming games from THQ Nordic last week, letting the likes of a new Spongebob Squarepants game and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> wash over me like barely flavoured fizzy water, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fatekeeper">Fatekeeper</a> showed up. I straightened up, just a little. It is a fancy looking first-person RPG made with all the hyper detail and vivid lighting you might expect of a game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It is also conjuring a game worth conjuring: the heavy hitting fantasy brawlabout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a>. As I watched the below trailer, I became more and more cautiously hopeful. Looks slick, but where's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dark-messiah-might-magic">the kick</a>?</p>

<p>It's being made by Paraglacial, a small THQ-owned studio made up of a few former Spellforce developers. And it isn't the first game to try capture the magical bootfoolery of Dark Messiah. A fantasy sword swinger called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellraid">Hellraid</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hellraid-development-on-hold">cancelled by Techland</a> some years ago, and it was while discussing that piteous loss that the studio began to plot their own take on first-person sword-slamming.</p>
<p>"We thought that this is a type of game that you don't see that often," said creative director Raphael Lubke during the showcase. "You have these huge awesome open world titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but you barely ever see like dedicated, more linear story-driven games with this nice focus on the combat mechanics of melee in a first-person game."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That combat does look weighty from what we were shown during a demo. Your two-handed sword is wielded with hefty swings, sometimes donking crankily off enemy shields, sometimes piercing their necks and entering a bottled animation that ends in a swift decapitation. You can take dashing sidesteps and swig health vials. It reminds me of the movement in Chivalry II, if your opponents were snarling singleplayer orc-a-likes in opulent armour, rather than screeching multiplayer knights. </p>
<p>We also get some hints as to other more magical powers you'll use, aside from the windy push powers and object-hurling telekinesis you can see in the above trailer. "You might be able to freeze a lake, lure enemies onto it, and then melt the ice with the fireball, for example," said Lubke. </p>
<p>But for now the focus seems to be on getting some chunky hits in with that massive claymore. At one point in the playthrough, the player coated a sword with poison and we watched as the heavy bruiser he was fighting slowly succumbed to the toxins, eventually keeling over. I will admit, even without that pivotal bootheel, there were some very entertaining ragdoll physics, not to mention some lovely vanishing screams as sharp-toothed foes tumbled into the pits below.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And these were some sheer drops. Paraglacial, the studio, is located in the German Alps, and it's a locale that has partly inspired the high-altitude terrain of the game's fantasy landscape (if not the ornate temple architecture). </p>
<p>"I always said this dream of founding is team in an area where you normally don't see game development teams, like remote rural areas like we are in the Alps," said Lubke. "And we also wanted to transport our love for this environment into the game and create a game world where the landscape, the environment is a part of the story itself. It's one of the main actors of the game.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It's not an open world game, the maps are designed in a not extremely open way, but they allow for a lot of different trajectories. [It's] not a straight line where you feel like you're playing on rails. Linear, for us, means control over the narrative and the density of the experience, but it doesn't mean forcing the player down a shallow path."</p>
<p>We get a few other glances of the bruiser's innards. An item screen that looks like a mash-up of the inventory management of Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, for example. And an easy-to-solve puzzle tomb that the developer says won't be quite so simple in the full game. But otherwise it's a short but enticing glimpse of some promising battering. Still, I want to see that conspicuously absent kick. After loving the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-chose-to-boot-its-melee-system-in-favor-of-that-excellent-kick">strong booting</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> enough to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3gvwJ1xcjs">an entire video conversation about it</a> with Colm (RPS in peace), I am yearning for another equally powerful pair of shoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fatekeeper-looks-like-a-spiritual-successor-to-dark-messiah-but-wheres-the-kick]]></content:encoded>

            <p>August 2025 now has as many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> developer diaries as there are modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> reimaginings: two, which in both cases remains a weirdly high number. But while last week’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finishing-skyblivion-is-a-new-dev-diary-series-about-the-last-leg-of-the-oblivion-remake-mods-run-to-release">Finishing Skyblivion</a> focused on one volunteer’s attempts at getting the ambitious Cyrodiil-in-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> mod over the line, this other vid makes a very specific pitch to those whose interest may have been diverted by Bethesda’s official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, showcasing how Skyblivion looks to more aggressively expand and rework the original RPG.</p>

<p>Perhaps most emblematic of this approach is the (re?)addition of Sutch, a city near Cyrodiil’s western coast that Bethesda planned for OG Oblivion before cutting it – save for the tiny ruin of Fort Sutch, which you can visit in both the original and the remaster – late in development. Skyblivion recreates it as a far bigger, if still largely wrecked, castle town that’s been occupied by bandit bastards, and which you’ll be able to explore in full.</p>
<p>A short walk south, the more familiar city of Anvil looks to have grown considerably, its central harbour now sitting in a much wider basin with added docks and market areas. Daedric hellscape The Deadlands, meanwhile, is getting split into two biomes: one that matches the original’s lava lakes and another, stormier region inspired by the Deadlands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>.</p>
<p>Skyblivion obviously isn’t averse to making cosmetic upgrades as well. The diary also reveals new designs for several of Oblivion’s unique weapons, many of which will throw in some special animations for your trouble. I desperately hope these keep the charmingly stiff bone-janking of Skyrim, as the default animations appear to. But the video is generally eager to emphasise the more practical differences between the mod and the original, which by extension, are also differences between the mod and the remaster.</p>
<p>Personally, my interest in Skyblivion has remained intact, even with Oblivion Remastered having been announced and released in the time since this dev diary’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4">last entry</a>. This is partly because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">performance headaches</a>, and that one quest where you get talked into watching someone do farm chores for six hours, made my time with the remaster unexpectedly shortlived. That said, I do like the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting">exploding houses by pointing at them</a>. I’d ask the Skyblivion team to implement something similar, but given the entire point of this diary, they probably wouldn’t be very happy about it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/another-skyblivion-dev-diary-shows-off-the-new-dungeons-and-expanded-cities-oblivion-remastered-never-bothered-with]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We enter week one of RPS Post-Graham. The office Slack echoes like the Great Hall of Durin after a Balrog teaparty. Horace coils about the foot of the Treehouse like a sullen Viking serpent. The Maw seems peevish and incontinent, spurning any news we offer it. The wifi network keeps changing its name to "Execute Order 66".</p>
<p>It is time to smash the emergency glass and bust out a few favourites from my personal collection of morale-boosting videogame intros. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtb4uow940c">Red Alert</a>, to put some spring in your step; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">Okami</a> to let the light in; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_6SYW2xwA">Colony Wars</a> for the WRAAAOW noise at the end. And here are this week's most interesting new PC games.</p><!--more-->

<p>As for what RPS staff are up to this week - I started late and missed the morning all-hands meeting, so I have no choice but to make it all up. James is trying to invent new buzzwords for graphics cards, each buzzier and wordier than the last. He's got as far as "polymorphotovoltaic processing" and shows no sign of showing down. Ollie has embarked on his magnum opus, a guide to Life. Jeremy has been reading too much Goldilocks and Proust and is lost in a series of flashbacks, each defined by the temperature of a particular bowl of porridge. Mark is engaged in an epic war against his neighbours, the Ice Giants, who have been trimming the hedge on his side again.</p></div>
