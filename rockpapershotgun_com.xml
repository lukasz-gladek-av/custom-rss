            <p>"As the internet likes to tell us, it’s been a while." Please keep waiting, there are some magazines over there if you need them. "It’s a process." Shouting won't increase the speed at which it happens. Do you "want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven"? Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard and co have said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in another little update that's seen them declare yet again that it is coming and add that development's going good thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It’s progressing really well," the Todd himself told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, about a month on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-but-thats-not-stopping-todd-howard-teasing-an-oblivion-remastered-style-shadow-drop">gently teasing that he might fancy shadow-dropping</a> this next mainline Elder Scroll. "The majority of the studio’s on VI, but I’ll say this: We always overlap. So, we’re very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it’s a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster – or a lot faster – but it’s a process that we want to get right."</p>
<p>I assume that part of the interview happened in the lounge/living room of house Bethesda. Then, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo burst in, wearing a chef's hat and one of those kiss the cook aprons. "It’s funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don’t put on ourselves," he said, grasping a tray in his oven mitts. "What do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p>
<p>As the smell of basting bird filled the room, Pagliarulo also suggested that taking "as long as it needs to be to be great" is just Bethesda following the tried and tested recipe for big meal success. "Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time," he reasoned, pointing to a page headed 'Massive open-world game drizzled in weighty expectations' in a Delia Smith cookbook. "GTA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">just got pushed again</a>, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs."</p><p>Meanwhile, studio director Angela Browder aimed to reassure the dinner guests that the grub, whenever it arrives, will knock their socks off. "The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry. It’s gonna be dope. It’s dope! [laughs]."</p>
<p>So, I assume Todd then said, just keep chowing down on your slightly stale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-shaped appetisers for the moment, if you get a bit peckish for old scrollage. Maybe go for a walk. Download some mods. Give the folks slaving away over a hot stove some space, lest you get slapped with a kitchen towel.</p>
