            <p>
There's a newish Persona game on the way next month, and it is, of course, yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5</a> spinoff. I'm not sure if another cow in existence has been so thoroughly milked before, but here we are. I call <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: The Phantom X (that's its name, by the way) newish because it's actually been available in China through an ongoing open beta for the last year. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> held a pre-recorded livestream confirming that the mobile game is finally coming westward, and that it'll be getting a PC release as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, despite being Persona 5 by name and aesthetic, it'll be offering up some fresh characters for once. You're still the Phantom Thieves, just a different bunch - the protagonist in this one is called Wonder, and the animal companion is an owl-looking critter.

Much like in the original, during the day you'll hang out with friends and study, and at night you'll venture out into dungeons. Apparently you will be able to meet Joker and other characters from the almost decade-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> (see what I mean about milking that cow) as part of special contracts. You'll apparently also find PvE elements called Velvet trials, alongside mini-games and the ability to make and join guilds.
</p>
<p>
It's definitely worth mentioning that this very much does seem to be Atlus' (very late) response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, as it is a free-to-play gacha game. Not ideal, particularly for those that find it difficult to play gacha games, but I'm sure Atlus will figure out how they can make yet another spinoff at some point.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's June 26th, a little over a month away, meaning you could probably fit in a Persona 5 replay as long as you just don't eat or sleep at all until then.
