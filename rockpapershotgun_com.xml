            <p>EA have made a tweak to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta's rush, and are keeping tabs on the situation in case it needs more balancing changes. This comes as some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> folks and Battlefield vets have voiced their displeasure with the version of the mode that's debuted in this second weekend of beta action.</p>
<p>The biggest moans are related to size. Namely the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">amount of players on each side</a> in these revamped rush battles and the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-adding-yet-another-tiny-map-battlefield-6-players-are-rightfully-clowning-on-its-definition-of-all-out-warfare/">relatively small maps</a> they're being contested on. As you might imagine, those two elements being a bit titchier in scale than previous Battlefields has also had knock on effects for other aspects of the mode.</p>

<p>"We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players," the Battlefield Comms account bugled out across the socials this morning. "We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments." As of writing, no more tweaks have yet been forthcoming.</p>
<p>For those who don't speak field battler, M-COMs are the military communications stations that serve as rush's objectives, with the key being to blow them up or stop the other team from doing so, depending on whether you're attacking or defending. The timer's the amount of tick-tocking it takes any bombs you plant on these stations to go kaboom.</p><div>

<p>We'll see how much difference that makes, but the two aspects of the beta's rush matches <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mpv4d9/what_is_this_garbage_called_rush/">drawing the most ire</a> from players who aren't merrily shooting away are the 12 vs 12 squad size limit and the smaller maps, which can't be easily fixed on the fly. The result's an experience that's not quite as expansive and vehicle-friendly in its chaos. At least in terms of the maps, Battlefield 6's devs have moved to reassure folks that larger ones do exist, with lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475">tweeting</a> that folks complaining about the frenetic speed of beta matches will see that "tempo scales accordingly".</p>
<p>This is just a beta, so there's plenty of time for further changes to be made if EA reckon the unhappy voices represent a majority. Insert joke here about them probably being best of not rushing to judgement.</p>
