            <p>If you're desperate for some company of a non-Adoring Fan kind as you run around Cyrodiil in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, odds are the base game'll leave you wanting. Enter a new mod, which adds in a beast master system that'll let you tame a furry or scaly pet.</p>
<p>After all, one could argue you've not really experienced Tamriel unless you're having to stop after every fight to give your precious wild boar Bobo some heal minor wounds-infused tummy tickles</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4468">Beast Master</a> is the mod in question, and the latest example of prolific ColdTyrant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-right-there-oblivion-remastered-modder-imperial-watch-proper-joinable-faction-new-quests-and-a-corruption-system">working to revamp</a> 2025's most 2006 release by giving folks new stuff to try once they've had their fill of shutting spooky doors. </p>
<p>Building on the pretty basic command creature spell from the base game, which Wood Elves have as a racial ability, he's put together a means for you to tame any animal you come across in the wilderness via magic and have it permanently join you on your adventures as a named "combat pet". In addition to being commandable and aiding you in fights like any regular companion, these pets can be fed grub from your inventory and interacted with in order to check on their mood.</p>
<p>That last bit has no impact in gameplay, so the mod's more of the casual pet ownership experience than a full Nintendogs-style furry thing parent simulation that'll leave you feeling even more unnerved than usual about your real life ability to look after actual human children.</p>
<p>Further to that end, you can only have one pet at any given time via the mod, so if you want to replace your tamed Imp named Fatso with a brown bear named Bingus or a troll named Sapphire, you'll have to release the former back into the wild. As of right now, the mod has short lists of pre-defined names and recruitable animals for you to pick from, but ColdTyrant has indicated he's open to adding more options based on suggestions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modder says he initially tried letting folks type in their own custom pet names, but had to ditch that option due to it being "literally impossible to rename an actor without clicking on them directly in the console" at the moment.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this Beast Master mod a go, youâ€™ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> are optional installs, but not hard requirements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will be updated sometime this month with "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords", but as is often the way of updates, some of the relevant boss files are already in the current version of the game, and yes, there's a mod if you want an early crack at them.</p><!--more-->
<p>From Software teased the coming of spruced-up boss battles in <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">a social media post</a> on 3rd June, offering no clue as to what "enhanced" means in this context. Enhanced movesets? Enhanced haircuts? An inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Subsequently, owl-eared, eagle-eyed players noticed that there were unused sections in every boss soundtrack theme that implied the addition of a third combat phase, together with unused boss relics that look like a reward for besting them in hard mode. Now, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/">PCGamer</a>, NexusMods user TerraMag has dug up the files that let you fight the "enhanced" Nightlords and released them as the obliquely named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92">Enhanced Nightlord Fights mod</a>.</p>
<p>If you lack the fortitude to face these maxed-out titans yourself, or you just want to chill to footage of an apoplectic gigaroach, TerraMag has kindly released some videos of the enhanced fights. Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't the final, From-sanctioned versions of each enhanced boss, so they might appear rough and unfinished. </p>

<p>TerraMag has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY_1VCfCjWg">harsh words for Adel, Baron of Night in one video description</a>, complaining that "this fucker REFUSED to do any normal bite moves to let me show off the new effect on it". Well, perhaps that's because you woke Adel's phase 3 incarnation up before the appointed time, guy. I'm not much of a morning person myself. Don't ask me to bite anybody before I've had my second coffee.</p>

            <p>
Okay, now, I know you've probably read that headline and thought to yourself "why on earth would outdated UI in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> be a good thing?" Allow me to explain! To be a contrarian for a moment, I think that a large amount of triple-A games have incredibly boring UI. It's very much because of that late 2010s trend of simple, emboss-free graphic design you see in logo design everywhere these days, and I hate it. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Silent Hill f, however, as shown off during today's Konami Press Start showcase, looks to have UI that would fit right at home in a PS3 game. It's outdated, technically, but it looks like it's been built with a lot more thought. It's not even particularly complicated - there's a health bar, a stamina bar, some kind ofâ€¦ floral and crescent moon bars. There's a light ugliness about it that I think a lot of games on the PS3 also had, even games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, that I find a lot more appealing than the modern, clean aesthetic you'll see a lot of. Just compare the original Demon Souls and its remake, for example.

The showcase did also do a bit of a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's gameplay, which, as is typical of the series, looks like you'll be swinging around a metal pipe a lot. Game director Al Yang did say the team is hoping to make sure the combat system is "fresh, but familiar, yet also be thematically appropriate and not overly complex."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't tell you if they've done that or not, though it doesn't matter to me all that much. It's not like I come to the Silent Hill series for exciting mechanics, I'm in it for the vibes. And the vibes do look good! There were some brief looks at some concept art, and the team spoke of how they set the game in the Showar era to tap into customs and superstitions "long forgotten in modern life."
</p>
<p>
I'm certainly a lot more interested in Silent Hill f than I am the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remake of the first game that was also announced</a>. It's the first new entry in years (no I'm not counting Ascension), so if anything I'm morbidly curious as to whether or not the world can actually be expanded in such a way or not. Plus, again, I like how unclean the UI is! I'm a simple person, with simple needs.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f is due out September 25th, later this year.
