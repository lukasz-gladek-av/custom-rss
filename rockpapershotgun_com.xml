            <p>
MiHoYo appear to be eternally busy. After printing copious amounts of money with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, they are continuing to do so with future releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genshin-impact-devs-next-game-looks-so-much-like-animal-crossing-im-almost-not-sure-why-it-exists">Petit Planet</a> (or Not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>) and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> (Not Pokemon). Now, it turns out, they're also working on an MMO, seemingly codenamed Genesis, that seemingly in some capacity incorporates AI, it's just unclear what kind.
</p>
<p>
As spotted over on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">ResetEra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">Eurogamer</a>), miHoYo shared a very short kind of teaser video acting as a sort of recruitment post for said MMO that's described as a "fantasy realism open world game." Details are quite slim, unsurprisingly, but here are the ones of note. It'll be made in Unreal Engine 5, it'll have PvP, "Intellectual NPC," and the two potentially controversial bits, an "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System," and "All-Terrain Battle AI."

<p>
A few points worth mentioning here. Something could have been lost in translation here, so it might not be talking about the bad kind of AI you and I hate. AI as a term has obviously been used to describe NPC behaviours for a long time too, so it could just be that. But miHoYo are no strangers to AI usage, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">they've even done so in Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and I'm not sure what an AI stimulated eco system could mean other than the bad kind. So, take all of this cautiously and skeptically until there's more details.
</p><p>
Judging from the very short teaser that exists, whatever Genesis ends up being like, it'll probably be a lot less anime (as vague a descriptor as that is) than games like Genshin Impact. A potential divergence for the company that relies on people getting much too invested in jiggly, overly cute women. Well, and the occasional man these days too. Diversity win!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> turns five years old next week, and ahead of that its developer Tom Sala has put in the work for a pretty big update. Update undersells it a touch I think, because it's being billed as a full-on remaster, complete with a touched up look, and plenty of mechanical changes. So, let's detail those details!
</p>
<p>
For one, landing sounds like it should be a lot easier, as you can land just by flying close to a perch without having to press a button. Speaking of buttons, the dash and acrobatics have been changed to have separate buttons and controls. Collision accuracy has been improved now too, with tighter movement to boot.

<p>
It's not just mechanics that have been updated, your warbird itself is looking fresher with individual feathers and more detail. Its head stays leveled when turning "(as birds of prey do)," and there are now wing flexing and steering animations. Landing and diving animations have been improved too, and player bird collision avoidance should be less annoying. I'm always striving to be less annoying! There's a long list of quality of life improvements, control tweaks, visual changes, bug fixes, and even just outright new stuff that you can check out in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/591787131954790437?l=english">Steam post</a>.
</p><p>
Talking in more depth in an earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1135260/view/506217467911078264?l=english">Steam post</a> about the remaster - which is out now and completely free for those that own the game, and is included if you haven't bought it yet - Sala was quite open about the base game's launch. "Every release is horror, but this one was pretty bad by every account," Sala wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"And let's be honest the PC launch suffered in many ways, some my own mistakes biting me, some consequences of releasing an indie console launch title in a week where both Xbox and Playstation were launching their next gen." Sala went on to explain how this is his chance at "doing it better," and better reflecting a game that's deeply personal to him, spending his free time working on this remaster whenever he could. As always, making games is hard! Nice work.
</p>
<p>
If you don't own The Falconeer, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135260/The_Falconeer_Revolution_Remaster/">try out it and its new remaster on Steam right now</a> completely for free until November 10th.

Slightly serious one here folks! The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, one of this year's best received games, is asking for some help for one of their lead playtesters, Matthew "Iggy" Kowalski. As shared on Bluesky, Iggy has polycystic kidney disease, leaving him with only a few months to find a living kidney donor.
</p>
<p>
Developer Dogubomb wrote on Bluesky that "Iggy was an invaluable tester and contributed so much to the project. He was absolutely brilliant in the game and came up with so many original strategies we had never considered. Please help us spread the word and as we help find him a living kidney donor."
</p>

</span></p><p>
Iggy lays his situation out very plainly on his <a href="https://www.iggyland.org/">personal website</a>: "I have a disease that requires a living kidney donor. There are no other viable options for me. I have only a few months before I will need to have this surgery before getting extremely sick and dying." He explains that his disease causes his kidneys to "have cysts grow all over them and make them massive in size. As they do so, the kidneys grow less and less in function. Think like the chest buster in Alien, except it’s not an alien baby and we don’t anticipate it coming to theatres this fall."
</p><p>
I share this with you because quite frankly, if you have a kidney you don't need, it would be nice if you could help out a dev in need! Iggy even clarifies that you don't need to be a perfect match, as some collaboration can be done with other donors to find the best-fit. There's more details on Iggy's website, so tell a friend even if you can't do it yourself!

            <p>
While there is a notable enough sentiment that old games are worse because they are old, so should therefore be either let to rot or to be remade so that they are "better," I think this argument goes out the window when you look at something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a>. That thing came out in 2022! And it launched on PS2 first! Yet here it is more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-23-years-on-final-fantasy-11-is-still-getting-updates-with-one-coming-thatll-let-you-change-how-your-character-looks">still getting updates</a>, and now, potentially, an entire new zone.

This week saw a new Freshly Picked Vana'diel, a semi-regularly held livestream from the Final Fantasy 11 team similar in nature to Final Fantasy 14's Letter from the Producer streams that details upcoming additions or changes, that sort of thing. It was held in Japanese, which I don't speak, but luckily some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/1oqvpee/freshly_picked_future_plans/">Redditors</a> who do explained that the team is seemingly preparing for the ability to make new areas.

As mentioned, this was originally a PS2 game, the PC release came a short while after, and that fact also appears to be a problem for the FF11 team. Everything is still made using the original PS2 dev kits, which obviously will be massively outdated by this point. Judging from some of the comments, on-stream the team discussed that they're working on plans in the event that these dev kits don't work anymore so that they can make new equipment still, and in particular start making new areas again.
</p><p>
I may not have spent any time with Final Fantasy 11 myself, but it really can't be understated how valuable it is that this 23 year old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is still going, let alone the fact it's still getting new content. These spaces become second homes (or even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/second-life">Second Life</a>) for some people, and sure, we should strive to not be too beholden to our computers, but they are still realms of virtual existence that deserve to be maintained. A new area would be pretty significant as there hasn't been a big new one since its 2015 expansion Seekers of Adoulin. Fingers crossed for those of you still playing!

I know, I know, change is difficult isn't it? It upset me just the other day that YouTube has changed videos so that they have rounded corners instead of being perfectly rectangular. It's sacrilegious! A feeling I will continue to have until I ultimately forget about it because life moves on to the next grievance. Still, subtle changes like that can often set some kind of internal alarm bells off, something you might have been experiencing with store pages on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> looking a bit… wider.
</p>
<p>
That is because they are, in fact, wider! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> have said as such somewhere along the line, and the update arrived in the digital storefront yesterday, with a nifty little <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528">blog post</a> explaining and showing what the changes actually are. Essentially, store pages for games and the few bits that aren't games have been widened from 940 pixels to 1200 pixels. Doesn't sound like much, but seeing it side by side, there's a surprising amount of space that's been added.
</p>
<p>
That's not the only difference, though. Images that show up in the carousel now have a higher resolution, and there's a couple new viewing modes to go along with that too; theater mode plasters images and videos across most of the screen, and full-screen mode is exactly what it sounds like. Devs will also have more control over the about sections of their games, again with bigger and higher-quality images, and more flexible formatting. You might also notice that store pages' background images pop a bit more too, as more colour and texture will come through.
</p>
<p>
This widening of Steam applies to other aspects of the store too, like search results and recommendation pages, with some general size adjustments for individual tags, charts, and the news hub. Apparently the homepage will be subject to a widening in the "near future too." Also, you shouldn't need to worry about pages being too wide if you're using a narrow browser or client, because Valve even tested it on some old iPod a team member "had laying around." Classic Valve.
