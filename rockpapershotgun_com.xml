            <p>Each army in Warhammer 40,000 has its own codex containing rules, lore, and nice pictures, and The Leagues Of Votann's - the game's contemporary space dwarves - was out of date before a single model was available to buy. Advance copies went out, people noticed that the rules were horribly broken, more people noticed that the rules were actually massively, horribly, absurdly broken, and the company issued an apology, pulling out their <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2CjuqDSg/leagues-of-votann-balance-update-a-word-from-james-workshop/">cutesy 'James Workshop' moniker</a> in an attempt to aw shucks the fact they'd just sold everyone some very expensive hardback kindling. They later issued some rules errata, and they're supposedly in a more sensible spot now, even if doing anything interesting with them visually is confined, as per, <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Grendl-Grendlsen-Squat-Bounty-Hunter-2018">to Necromunda</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to bet money on it, I'd guess they won't be nearly as broken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2</a> when they appear as potential allies or foes for both the Ad-mech and Necron playable factions. That's because difficulty balance was one of the major problems holding the original Mechanicus back from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> greatness (the game was later patched), so I imagine it being at the forefront of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> Studio's mind this time. Decide for yourself by observing the trailer below. How many busted tokens do these dwarves have in their beards?</p>

<p>If you skipped the first Mechanicus, it was notable for a couple of things: an absurdly entertaining action economy that let your late game popebots sweep maps without stopping for breath (do Ad-mech breathe?) and a soundtrack that felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU">pipe organ had gained sentience</a> and declared war on reality itself. It was, balance aside, a good time, and I'm interested to see what Bulwark have learned from their first outing.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the game's Steam page lists the release date as TBA, but the presser I received reckons it's out sometime this year. This may be old news by the time you're reading this, by which time hundreds of billions of cells in my body will have been replaced. A truly antiquated and wasteful biological system I wouldn't have to deal with if the machine god would simply bless my digusting, fallible flesh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Microsoft have "taken measures" to reduce "politically focused emails", says spokesperson</p>

            <p>Microsoft are reportedly blocking employee internal work emails that contain the words "Palestine" or "Gaza". The report in question comes from No Azure For Apartheid (NOAA), a group of Microsoft workers formed to protest the company's then-alleged supplying of AI tech to the Israeli military - something Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">have since confirmed</a>, while also stating that their own internal reviews found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“NOAA believes this is an attempt by Microsoft to silence worker free speech and is a censorship enacted by Microsoft leadership to discriminate against Palestinian workers and their allies," spokesperson and former Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/672312/microsoft-block-palestine-gaza-email">The Verge</a> (paywalled) in a statement. Nasr added that "words like ‘Israel’ or ‘P4lestine’ do not trigger such a block".</p>
<p>When asked for comment by The Verge, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw responded with the below:</p>
<p>“Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate. We have an established forum for employees who have opted in to political issues. Over the past couple of days, a number of politically focused emails have been sent to tens of thousands of employees across the company and we have taken measures to try and reduce those emails to those that have not opted in.”</p>
<p>As The Verge note, the reported email blocks follow a week of employee protests about the company's dealings with the Israeli military. There have also been protests during Microsoft's Build developer conference this week. On Monday, former employee Joe Lopez <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670812/microsoft-build-protest-keynote-jay-parikh-palestinian-tech-worker">interrupted</a> CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote by shouting “how about you show Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?”, before sending emails to "thousands" of colleagues. Microsoft fired Lopez on the same day.</p>
<p>The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">currently calling on the public to boycott Microsoft's wares</a>, including Xbox products like Game Pass. The BDS organisers include Nasr and Abdo Mohamed, another former Microsoft employee. They were both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired after organising a vigil for Palestinians</a> killed in Gaza outside the company’s Washington HQ.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
