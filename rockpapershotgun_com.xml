            <p>I wish that I could fly, that I could fly, and I could fly, just like a dragonfly, Mr Bond. I want to get away, just like a dragonfly, Mr Bond. YEAH YEAH YEAH, Mr Bond. I want a Milky Way, Mr Bond. I'd just like a Milky Way, YEAH YEAH YEAH (Milky Way), Mr Bond. Oh, and the official James Bond account appears to have leaked a trailer showing Lenny Kravitz as a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, villain, Mr Bond.</p>

<p>The video above isn't the trailer the <a href="https://x.com/007">007 Twitter account</a> shared and the yanked earlier today, as spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/">users on ResetEra</a>. It is, however, the first thing which comes to mind when I think of musician Lenny Kravitz, whom the trailer shows lending his face to a First Light villain named Bawma.</p>
<p>Bawma, according to the text of the tweet that's handily been screenshotted by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-leak-reveals-music-star-will-play-new-james-bond-villain-and-youll-never-guess-who-it-is">Ian Games Network</a>, "rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph." He's "the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable."</p><p>Bawma shows off this charismatic unpredictability in the trailer by threatening to drop Bond into a pit of female crocodiles. Bond, always thinking with his tadger, ends the trailer by saying "Girls? Of course." Like he's just figured out his life's a big cosmic knob joke. A cosmic knob joke that'll presumably be laughed at again at tonight's Geoff Awards, assuming IO Interactive debut this trailer properly there.</p>
<p>Anyway, shout out to Neil Cicierega for absolutely ruining a bunch of songs for me in the best way possible. Make sure you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE">bustin</a> into our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Geoff Awards liveblog</a> today if you fancy watching the show alongside us.</p>

Well, well, well, here comes Geoffers. G-Kay, the awarder of golden PDF badges to videogames, best pal to every celebrity less tasteful than Edward Norton. Gentleman Keighley, with his mindflaying footwear and his hands all lubed up to wangle fresh announcements from the games industry's chapped orifices. But what's this! His trousers are bellowing. He's got something stuffed down them, something that honks and rumbles like an elephant seal, something that yearns to raise the banner of victory over 10 million planets. 
</p>
<p>
Geoff grabs his groin and waddles away desperately, but not fast enough. His backside explodes in a rank gust of Promethium. A terrifying cybernetic face peers from the breach. "FOR THE EMPEROR," it hollers, while Geoff frantically seeks cover behind Evanescense. "FOR THE EMPEROR, PROBABLY! BUT MAYBE ACTUALLY FOR THE REBELLION INSTEAD."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All of which is my extremely funny way of saying that a new Warhammer 40,000 game may be forthcoming at this year's Geoffening, aka The Game Awards, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">stream here</a>. Specifically, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 game.</p>
<p>We know from Creative Assembly's 25th series anniversary showcase last week that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">they'll be announcing a sizeable new thing at the annual Keighley Hootenanny</a>. During that previous anniversary showcase, there was also some footage of the developers' new Warcore game development tech, including a shot of a stone house with some filenames next to it. Amongst those filenames redditor Knavbot has found the magic words "40K". See below, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-total-war-fan-spots-what-looks-like-a-leak-for-creative-assemblys-much-rumored-total-war-warhammer-40000-with-the-game-awards-announcement-just-hours-away">Ian Games</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_base_colour</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_material_map</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_normal</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spoilsports among you are hastening to point out that "40K" could refer to something else. Perhaps Creative Assembly have invented the first 40K resolution videogame, for example. Perhaps you will need a dedicated fusion reactor to operate your next gaming PC.</p><p>Detractors may also comment that while it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">rumoured for yonks</a> that Total War is heading to the grim darkness of the far future, there's a parallel rumour which suggests that the next major instalment of the strategy series will take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Back in May last year, a Dualshockers report <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">spoke of a Total War Star Wars game</a>, much to Nic's (RPS in peace) dismay.
</p>
<p>
"Why not both?" ask the terrible, eternally hungry people for whom nothing is ever Total enough. "After all, that Dualshockers report mentions <em>three</em> currently in development Total War games, and we already know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a>." Sure! Why not make them all 40K resolution games while you're at it. Why not literally remove the eyelids of every Total War artist. Why not stitch them together into a human centipede that exists only to output scintillating high-def images of falling sand grains on Tatooine.
</p>
<p>
For me, the choice of licensed adaptations comes down to which game title I'll have the most fun abbreviating. I quite like "Star Twar", but "TwartyK" is just, so excellent. Might retire now, tbh. Still, you can probably do better. You can also tell me whether you think Creative Assembly have the chops to make a strategy game that's as ranged combat and vehicle-heavy as a Warhammer 40K or Star Wars game would need to be. Also: space battles?!
