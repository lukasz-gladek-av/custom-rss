            <p>Congrats, Andrew! You're almost certainly not reading this, but regardless, it's only polite for me to offer you a big well done, Mr Wilson. After all, you, EA's CEO, were paid $30.5 million (around £22 million) in the financial year just gone, nearly $5 million (around £3.6 million) than you were the one before that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company's full-time workers only took home $117,000 (around £85k) on average, down from $149,000 (around £108k) in 2024, and the lowest since 2022, which saw EA employees earn $116,000 (around £84.5k) according to the average EA used. In order to illustrate just how huge the gulf between the cash given to Wilson per year and the median pay of the people under him who actually do the work, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target">Game File</a>'s Stephen Totilo has made a hugely stretched graph that's well worth checking out if you want a good laugh followed by a big sigh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA opted to use the median rather than the mean to calculate that average salary among its staff in its latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000130817925000556/ea014143-def14a.htm#pro014143a014">proxy statement</a>. Basically, they pulled the middle salary number from the bunch, rather than adding them all together and dividing by the total number of salaries included. Hello, secondary school maths.</p>
<p>Wilson's $30 milion in cash and stock during the 12 months that drew to a close on March 31 was up on the $26 million he earned the year before that, and his biggest windfall since taking home $39 million in 2021. Time for a new yacht, methinks. And during a period that saw EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">lay off</a> a bunch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">of staff</a>.</p>
<p>His base salary of $1.3 million (about £947k) was the same as it has been since at least 2023, with $25.7 million (around £18.7 million) in stock awards, $2.8 million (around £2 million) via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 (around £494k) in "other compensation" bringing his pay up to that $30 million total. The vast majority of the bump came from his stock increasing to that new number from just over $20 million (around $14.5 million) in 2024.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year">Game Developer</a>, it wasn't just Wilson getting more money either. All four of the other top execs EA listed individual pay numbers for in the proxy statement containing this data recieved increases by either a little or a lot compared to their 2024 totals.</p>
<p>Congrats to all of them! Stuart Canfield, Laura Miele, Mala Singh, Jacob Schatz, you too! Well deserved millions, all of which should definitely have been given to just five people, who'll need every last dime just to pay their bills.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-is-retiring-the-blue-screen-of-death-for-a-black-one-this-summer.1229889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There used to be - and might still be - a tradition at the UK's Reading music festival where you'd be lying in your sleeping bag at night and you'd suddenly hear a low rumbling in the distance, which would then become indecipherable shouting, which you'd soon realise was rows of campers shouting the word 'bollocks' from their tents in a sort of Mexican wave, getting louder and closer as you waited in fizzy anticipation for your turn to shout. You'd then listen to the whole thing play out in reverse as the bollocktide receded into the pleasant autumn twilight.</p>
<p>I thought about this as I read multiple headlines referring to the Windows blue screen of death as 'iconic' this morning. Extreme annoyance elevated to the status of folk legend. Mythologising a shared experience of catastrophe. The whole world shouting 'bollocks' together.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft announced that they'd be redesigning the BSOD back in March via a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/28/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-3653-beta-channel/">blog post</a> accompanying a preview build for members of their Windows Insiders program. Those using the preview found that the BlueSOD was no more, replaced instead by a BlackSOD. Now, Windows have confirmed they're sticking with it, and it's due for a rollout for everyone on Windows 11 later this Summer.</p>
<p>“This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,” Microsoft's VP of enterprise and OS security David Weston told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official">The Verge</a>. “Part of it just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.”</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/">blog post</a> from yesterday if you fancy reading their full explanation of the update. It contains sentences like "a key trait of a resilient organization is the ability to maintain productivity and minimize disruptions", and "in today’s threat landscape, organizations can’t afford to treat resilience as a reactive measure". As the Verge note, this is all likely in response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages">far-reaching Crowdstrike outages</a> last year, which indeed had a lot of people shouting "bollocks" in unison.</p>
<p>The blue screen of death has been around for 40 years at this point, since Windows' first version in 1985. I imagine most of you also remember the BSOD's console gaming cousin, the Xbox 360's hardware failure-signifying red ring of death, aka the reason I've never played Fable 2. Other variants include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation">Amiga's Guru Meditation Error</a> (based on an in-joke about staff adopting calming poses in response to crashes), and <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Sad_Mac">Apple's Sad Mac</a>. None of which are as good as <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/t/funny-error-informational-messages/476910/2">this one</a> though:</p>

<p>If you've missed out on what else those loveable tykes at Microsoft HQ have been up to recently, the company confirmed in May that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied AI technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. That same month, they kicked off plans to start laying off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">3% of their 228,000 strong workforce</a> (around 7000). According to a recent Bloomberg report, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-staff-yet-again-with-substantial-cuts-expected-at-xbox">they're planning to lay off more workers at Xbox soon</a>. The company made around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html">$88 billion in profit for 2024's fiscal year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/windows-is-retiring-the-blue-screen-of-death-for-a-black-one-this-summer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Despite currently sitting above the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> in the fourth spot on Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most-played chart</a>, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/">Bongo Cat</a> clicker game is "actually losing us money in the end", according to its devs.</p>
<p>So, why are developers Irox Games and their CEO Marcel Zurawka keeping this app about a meme cat that sits on your desktop and drops a big slap every time you click on a thing going? Well, in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steams-fourth-most-played-game-doesnt-really-make-any-money-and-its-developer-says-its-better-off-that-way">interview with Eurogamer</a>, they explained that the bot-infested idler's true worth is in helping advertise another game they're trying to vault up the Steam pre-release popularity charts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Some people said, 'Oh you're now rich.' That's bullshit, I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said, revealing that in its biggest month so far it raked in $4,050 once expenses like Steam's cut were factored in. That was in April, when the game was at its attention zenith, with the number looking like it's steadily dropping in the couple of months since.</p>
<p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," the CEO claimed, "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p>
<p>This is where things get weird. Like some other free-to-play clickers seemingly attracting high player numbers on Steam, a lot of the folks the data counts as 'playing' Bongo Cat aren't people, they're bots farming and selling the cat hats and skins it dishes out on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=3419430">Steam's community market</a> for real cash. Zurawka estimates that "roughly 50 percent" of Bongo Cat's player base, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3419430/charts/#1m">currently ranges</a> from about 150,000 to just under 200,000 at peak, is made up of these automated auctioneers.</p>
<p>Despite that, the developer says money made from this robotic wheeler dealing only amounts to roughly half or less what the game makes each month. Where does it prove its worth, then? Well, as a big bot-infested advert for another game Irox Games are trying to ensure doesn't drown in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">Steam's discoverability maelstrom</a>.</p>
<p>After having a roguelite city builder called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473640/EcoGnomix/?curator_clanid=45040150">EcoGnomix</a> flop, Zurawka and co are using Bongo Cat to promote their next game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590650/OKU/?curator_clanid=45040150">Oku</a> - a very un-Bongo Catty monk adventure. They're even giving out some of those cosmetics to folks who do stuff like watch Oku's trailer. The exec says he's had publishers ask how much Bongo Cat cost to make, something that Eurogamer note could lead to potentially less ethical Bongo copycats.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, Steam's already bulging ranks being filled up even further with games that mainly exist, at least from a practical perspective, to advertise other games isn't a future I'd be a fan of. Though, given the times we're living in, that probably means it's the one we'll end up with.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's great to see devs working to find themselves solutions to the incredibly tough task that is making smaller games stand out from the crowd in the great rat race for Steampremacy, and Zurawka does appear to care about making Bongo Cat a good game real people do actually enjoy playing. It might be a tad idealistic, but I'm just hoping there's a better way that'll allow devs to concentrate on just making the games they want to, without having to consider aiming for a short turnaround viral hit that the robo-grinders really love.</p>
<p>As the dev told EG: "It's a bit disappointing to see that it takes you to having to be successful to be successful."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-popular-bongo-cat-clicker-is-losing-money-but-its-worth-to-its-devs-lies-elsewhere]]></content:encoded>
