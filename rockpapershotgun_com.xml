            <p>In classic me fashion, I swanned off for a few days just as another graphics card fracas has spilled out into public view. At the centre this time is the previously unassuming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-gpus-are-launching-soon-with-price-cuts-on-the-rtx-5060-ti">RTX 5060</a>, which you may have noticed is due for launch today yet only has a handful of "hands-on previews" to tell you how big of a graphics it does. Allegedly, that’s because Nvidia have been keeping hold of the drivers needed for full reviews, only providing them at the eleventh hour to press outlets that have previously run these previews. No preview? No review, at least until the drivers release publicly later today, and what's more, the same reports say that these previews were only offered under strict testing provisos set by Nvidia themselves.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews">VideoCardz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFDz-BQLew">Hardware Unboxed</a>, the mandated test conditions supposedly range from only allowing certain games for benchmarking – judging from the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-first-impressions">previews</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/desktop-pc/i-spent-my-first-few-hours-with-the-rtx-5060-playing-doom-the-dark-ages-and-it-feels-pretty-slick-for-under-usd300/">currently</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/i-tested-the-rtx-5060-is-8gb-of-vram-really-enough-in-2025">online</a>, these were <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> – to the more egregious demand that RTX 5060 performance figures would focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation</a> (MFG). And, in turn, would only be compared to results from older XX60 GPUs that lack DLSS frame gen support entirely.</p>

<p>"We worked with a few chosen media on previews with a pre-release driver," an Nvidia spokesperson told me this afternoon. No comment on the review driver situation, other than a 5pm BST release time, was given.</p>

<p>RPS was not invited to take part in these previews, and I can’t imagine agreeing to such terms if we were. Although it doesn’t appear that Nvidia required previewers to give positive RTX 5060 takes, with several highlighting the shortcomings of its 8GB VRAM limit, the limited game selection and emphasis on frame-genned performance versus the much older RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 Super are clearly intended to push a particular narrative: one that at best downplays the drawbacks of frame generation and at worst misleads readers with an unhelpfully narrow view of relative performance. GameStar, a German site that took Nvidia up on the offer, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">said in their preview</a> that the GPU giant even specified the in-game settings that each game should be tested with.</p>
<p>The sense that a big, green thumb is pressing down on the critical scales is deepened by the alleged trading of earlier review drivers for a compliant preview. Even if, by that point, reviewers are free to use their own, independently-set benchmarks, the initial wave of RTX 5060 reviews will come from publications that Nvidia has – accurately or otherwise – deemed more friendly than others. Those who refused the locked-down previews, and have thus demonstrated less of a willingness to go along with the desired messaging, will be forced to wait before sharing impressions.</p>
<p>I can’t claim absolute moral superiority here because again, I wasn’t invited, and thus didn’t have the chance to send a "Thanks but no thanks" email (even I <em>hadn’t</em> simultaneously been too busy recovering from gin-assisted groomsman duty). Still, yeah, not a fan.</p>
<p>I have recently noticed Nvidia PRs becoming unusually pushy about how great it would be to test such and such frame generation in such and such game, but functionally those have only ever been suggestions, and I’ve never faced even a veiled hint at retribution for ignoring them in my reviews. Nonetheless, I now find myself in the bizarre position of having had physical possession of an RTX 5060 for nearly a week (posted by Zotac, with no strings attached other than to please not lose or break it), yet don’t have the software means to test or appraise it on the day of release. Like, man, at least Bethesda didn’t send us copies of Starfield while they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-starfield-review-is-going-to-be-a-little-late">withholding the activation keys</a>.</p>

<p>More disturbing still is that this isn’t even the only accusation of editorial manhandling to be laid at Nvidia’s feet today. Big-deal tech YooToobers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus">Gamers Nexus</a> claimed in a video (above) that Nvidia have, with varying levels of subtlety, threatened to cut off their interview access to Nvidia engineering staff in response to a perceived lack of focus on DLSS and MFG performance testing in their reviews. Gamers Nexus have, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nfEkuqNX4k">produced</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1FHR9fkJk">multiple</a> long-form vids on these topics specifically.</p>
<p>It isn’t unheard of for, nor technically outside the rights of, companies to pick and choose who gets primo access for coverage. In tech media especially, there may even be a minor, ethically unbothersome quid-pro-quo involved: attending a virtual briefing, for instance, in exchange for getting onto the review list. But there’s a honking great difference between asking journalists to sit through a thirty-minute slideshow and, essentially, demanding editorial jurisdiction over how their products are evaluated. Nvidia, one of the richest, most powerful firms on Earth, should know better – and should have at least had an idea that being caught fiddling with the independent review process might cause more damage to the RTX 5060 than a few variations of "It’s not much faster than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">4060</a>, is it?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have finally broken their silence over reports about the use of Azure and Microsoft generative AI tech by the Israeli military during the latter’s on-going invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">unsigned statement published 15th May 2025</a>, Microsoft confirm that they have supplied technology to the Israeli armed forces during the assault on Gaza, which began following the killing and abduction of Israeli civilians on October 7th 2023. They contend, however, that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." The news comes a few weeks after the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">called on people to avoid Microsoft games and gaming services in protest</a> at the company’s dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to several investigations earlier this year, including <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">a sizeable February report from the Associated Press</a>, the IDF have made use of Microsoft’s generative AI services extensively for combat and intelligence activities since October 2023. This includes the alleged use of genAI models to analyse and prepare data for the purpose of targeting airstrikes. The AP investigation - which is based on interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents - also discusses the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle.</p>
<p>These reports have intensified fears among many Microsoft staff that their work is being used as an instrument of war and oppression. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a>, "No Azure for Apartheid," demanding an independent audit for potential human rights violations. Microsoft leadership have taken a hard line with certain, more visible protests about the sale of Microsoft services to the Israeli military. In April this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-fire-employees-who-protested-the-sale-of-genai-tech-to-the-israeli-military">fired two people</a> who spoke out at company anniversary events.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft are trying to reassure those who remain. In the blog post, Microsoft announce the completion of an internal review of claims that Microsoft technology has been used "to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza," with "additional fact-finding" supplied by an external firm. The blog post comments that Microsoft’s supply of tech to the Israel Ministry of Defense is "structured as a standard commercial relationship," and is therefore subject to their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all">acceptable use policy</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/ai-code-of-conduct">AI Code of Conduct</a>, together with their overall <a href="https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2025/05/Microsofts-Commitment-to-Human-Rights.pdf">commitment to human rights</a>. Microsoft say that, based on "both our internal assessments and external review," they’ve found no evidence that the Israeli armed forces have failed to comply with either document.</p>
<p>The blog also notes that military organisations "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees’ questions." Microsoft, it says, have not created anything like this for the IMOD.</p>
<p>The blog adds, however, that Microsoft did provide the IMOD with "special access" to their technologies in the course of "limited emergency support to the Israeli government in the weeks following October 7, 2023, to help rescue hostages". Microsoft say they retained "significant oversight" during this period, "including approval of some requests and denial of others," so as "to help save the lives of hostages while also honoring the privacy and other rights of civilians in Gaza."</p>
<p>The post also caveats that Microsoft do not have full awareness of how the Israeli military may have used any Microsoft technology that runs on their own servers. "This is typically the case for on premise software," it argues. "Nor do we have visibility to the IMOD’s government cloud operations, which are supported through contracts with cloud providers other than Microsoft. By definition, our reviews do not cover these situations."</p>
<p>It’s an extremely brief response to a lengthy and disturbing series of claims, which expects the reader to take a lot on trust. The blog post does not include the full text of Microsoft’s internal and external assessments, nor does it respond to the detail of the allegations made by the Associated Press and other publications. It doesn’t even name the firm hired to carry out "additional fact-finding" for their review.</p>
<p>The No Azure for Apartheid movement have already called on Microsoft to release a full copy of their internal review. "It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," former Microsoft worker Hossam Nasr argues in a statement, circulated by Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>.</p>
<p>Nasr and his colleague Abdo Mohamed were themselves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired by Microsoft</a> last year, after they helped organise a vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza. They’ve since joined the BDS boycott on Xbox and Microsoft gaming products, which you can read more about on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the official BDS site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
