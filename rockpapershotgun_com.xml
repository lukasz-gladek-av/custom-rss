            <p>An artist has accused Bungie of plagiarising her designs and using them in upcoming first-person shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>. The artist, who creates futuristic posters under the name Antireal (or "4nt1r34l"), posted images of her own work alongside screenshots from Marathon's recent alpha playtest, showing that some designs have been copied. Bungie have confirmed this is the case, but lay the blame on one former artist at the studio.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs i made in 2017," said the artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">on Xitter</a>. "Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The images she shares as proof clearly show elements from her posters reused without alteration on objects in the extraction shooter, like walls, containers, and tarpaulins. Another image she made seems to be the basis for designs used during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-gearing-up-to-reveal-something-about-marathon">Marathon's ARG in April</a> and on the game's official website. You can even make out the artist's handle "Antireal" in one of the offending game assets, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billain.bsky.social/post/3lpafnqfaa22x">pointed out by one of her fans</a>. Several of the artists at Bungie, including art director Joseph Cross, have been following the independent artist on social media while working on the game.</p>
<p>"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally," she says, "but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email. </p>
<p>"In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living."</p>
<p>Bungie have responded to the artist's complaints. They say it's true that her work appeared in the game's alpha, but claim this was an "oversight" and only one former employee from their art team is responsible. </p>
<p>"We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game," said the studio in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonteam.bungie.net/post/3lpb36jqb5c22">a post on social media</a>. "This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.</p>
<p>"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission."</p>
<p>But policy is one thing and practice is another. This is the 4th time an artist has come forward to complain that Bungie have used their work without permission, as pointed out by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/artist-accuses-bungie-of-stealing-her-designs-for-marathons-art-i-am-tired-of-designers-from-huge-companies-moodboarding-and-parasitising-my-designs-while-i-struggle-to-make-a-living/">PC Gamer</a>. Last year, they <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1833988238912155813">copied the designs of a Nerf gun</a> in a case that was eventually resolved. In 2023 they <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">copied a design by digital artist Julian Faylona</a> for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> cutscene. And in 2021 they used <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">a fan's art</a> in a trailer without asking. Bungie also still face <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungie-has-motion-to-dismiss-destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-denied-over-vaulted-campaign-storyline">a copyright lawsuit by a writer</a> who alleges the game's Red War storyline stole from his ideas (although it should be said this case is not so cut and dry as the above art nabbings).</p>
<p>Bungie say they will take steps to prevent things like this happening again, and that they'll go through the work of the bus-undered employee to make sure there are not other cases of plagiarism. </p>
<p>"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</p>
<p>"We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them."</p>
<p>It might be fair to read such promises with a wary eye, given the studio's recent record. If you like Marathon's design style, you might enjoy the original work of Antireal, whose posters are <a href="https://antireal.info/">viewable on her website</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two Interactive's CEO Strauss Zelnick has served up some dutiful, investor-pleasing sentiments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">delay from 2025 release to a 26th May 2026 launch date</a>. Rockstar, he says, are "seeking perfection", and "consumer anticipation is unprecedented". As such, "affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment".</p>
<p>All that's from a hot mix of Take-Two Interactive's latest quarterly financial results and an interview with our colleagues/primordial mythical adversaries at the Ice Giant Network. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a>, Zelnick commented that the need for "continued polish became clear" as the game neared completion, and that "there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations."</p>
<p>Regarding the inevitable question of whether GTA 6 will be delayed again, he added that "historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it." Which is possibly more true in console land: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> was pushed back once on console from its initial spring window to 17th September 2013, but the PC version didn't arrive till 14th April 2015.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">the earnings presentation</a>, Zelnick reiterated that "affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment". He also threw in a bit of trivia. Apparently, GTA 6 "began development in earnest in 2020" after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gets-a-second-trailer-but-theres-still-no-date-for-a-pc-version">recent second GTA 6 trailer</a> is supposedly the "biggest video launch of all time, with over 475 million views in 24 hours". Spotify streams of the song from that trailer, Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters, have "surged by 182,000%, once again proving Rockstar's ability to influence popular culture".</p>
<p>This is probably my 9am brain talking, but I find this last point sort of provocative inasmuch as right now, I'm scratching my head a little about the specifics of GTA's cultural impact. It <em>is</em> an undeniable influence on popular culture, be it in the form of moral panics about kiddies playing crime simulators, or in how its urban sandbox has influenced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> designers, or in the vast extent of the modding community, or - yes - in how it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAgUYyosqVM">popularised certain songs</a>.</p>
<p>That said, and for all the game's stature, GTA today is innately and proudly derivative. It skims the froth of American life, sometimes satirically in the form of, say, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Bleeter">Bleeter</a>, and often affectionately in the form of nods to celebrated movies and TV shows - GTA 6's star couple Jason and Lucia are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-anti-heroes-of-grand-theft-auto-6-look-sexy-and-dull">influencer incarnations of Bonnie and Clyde</a>. One consequence of that is a certain hollowness.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Not actually a stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> hybrid of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood"> Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief">Thief</a> - although I'd pay good money for that - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodthief">Bloodthief</a> is closer to something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> but also, I think, much better. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941730/Bloodthief_Demo/">Steam demo</a>'s opening levels are roughly as tricky and demanding as the cyberpunk parkour series but, perhaps to due to less concern with being stylish, the movement here feels a lot more caffeinated. You only have to look at the visuals to clock that Bloodthief isn't that sort of game that's precious about letting you do silly things with momentum.</p>
<p>Also you're a vampire, with a sword, exsanguinating armoured knights in a vaguely Germanic medieval town. Well, Vae my Victus. I do get very excited when anything reminds me, even a little, of Blood Omen: Legacy Of Kain. Here's a nice little video of the game in action. Warning: this trailer for the game Bloodthief has blood in it.</p>

<p>Even in the early levels, the way your various movement options chain together starts to get nicely silly. Wall running itself feels a little loose, but an air dash that lets you grapple to enemies while lining up your next slide lets you clear huge distances in seconds. There's, uh, there's also a missile parry but I won't hold that against it (I've reached critical parry mass at this point). Features? Absolutely, yeah. Several:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bloodthief is an ultra-fast melee dungeon-runner where you use momentum to parkour through hazardous dungeons and brutally slash through enemies. Speed-run through medieval dungeons and castles and learn what dark secrets lie beneath the surface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Bloodthief you play as a vampire, and the blood of your foes fuels your abilities and propels you to insane speeds. Movement and combat are deeply intertwined—you’ll need to use both in a beautiful dance of skill and carnage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Levels full of branching paths, shortcuts, and secrets reward those with the skill and creativity to pull them off. Find the perfect path through labyrinthine dungeons and reap the rewards for your efforts.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Matthew (RPS in peace) died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghostrunner-review">1423 times in Ghostrunner</a>. I think I might have doubled that in 20 minutes with Bloodthief's demo, but they are the sort of deaths that make a man a hungry for mastery. Also, Wotsits. But mainly mastery. It's a decent sized demo, too, with six levels. The full game is "coming soon", but you can experience the unbeatable taste of Flamin' Hot Crunchy Wotsits right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
