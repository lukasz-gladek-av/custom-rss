            <p>The founder of gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers has been accused of abuse and financial mismanagement. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">Speaking to IGN</a>, former employees who worked at AbleGamers alleged multiple instances of sexist and emotionally abusive behavior, financial mismanagement, as well as aggressive, racist, and inappropriate remarks by founder Mark Barlet. Barlet denies the allegations.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After allegedly being told by Barlet that she was effectively the company's HR because she was the only woman that worked there, one source was sent to work on an HR case. This "was really illegal of me because I didn’t have those credentials," she told IGN. Barlet reportedly made light of this situation for several weeks afterward, "causing numerous employees to feel uncomfortable". Following childbirth, the same woman was told by Barlet in a meeting that her "jugs had gotten so big that he wouldn’t know how to handle them".</p>
<p>The source also described hearing Barlet make racist remarks about other employees. In one instance, Barlet reportedly said that "we need to get the most fucked up disabled person to be on our marketing, the one with real multiple disabilities," while making mocking gestures. The source told IGN that Barlet's "behaviors with her grew increasingly hostile every time she spoke out against him". Barlet also was reportedly dismissive or aggressive towards other accessibility advocates, telling one individual over a call that they were "a drop in the pond of accessibility. And I own the pond".</p>
<p>According to another anonymous source, Barlet also mismanaged funds from the millions in donations the charity recieved over the years. "Funds were allocated for first-class tickets for certain leadership, hotel rooms before or after the dates of designated events, and even expensive meals for office staff that primarily consisted of remote employees," write IGN. The same source alleges that Barlet also used the nonprofit's budget to pay for a Tesla charger for AbleGamers's headquarters, despite being the only one there who drove a Tesla. Salaries were also a point of contention with the nonprofit, with alleged favouritism dictating pay, and "some employees earning far more for doing far less within the company".</p>
<p>This all came to a head in April last year, when a former employee ordered an investigation by payroll and HR service ADP, who allegedly advised AbleGamer's independent board to terminate Barlet "immediately due to the severe nature of the allegations," write IGN. The independent board allegedly ignored ADP's findings. Barlet eventually left the nonprofit following another external investigation.</p>
<p>When reached out to by IGN for comment, Barlet said that "after thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," telling IGN that the allegations and subsequent investigation occured after he was allegedly advised to cut back on AbleGamers' workforce. He also responded to the claims of financial mismanagement, denying the Tesla charger purchase and several other allegations. IGN note that Barlet provided "no evidence to refute the allegations, only his word", and refused to show documentation unless correspondence was off the record.</p>
<p>A source who spoke to IGN alleges that those who spoke out against Barlet were retaliated against by the board. "The people that were fired were all ones that filed reports or talked to lawyers." AbleGamers officials did not respond to IGN's request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-adds-new-cars-and-muddy-tracks-with-more-planned-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Speedy fender-bender 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> has added two new cars to its roster of smashmobiles alongside two new tracks, including one track from the first game that's been given a "makeover". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a> is still in earliest of access, so this only brings the total number of vehicles up to six, and the selection of tracks is still limited too. But it's the start of what developers Bugbear see as steady progress, with more cars and courses set to come next month.</p>

<p>The new cars include a European sports sedan called the Bravion and a familiar American longbrute called Rammer, which featured in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> as a reliable early career car. I certainly drove it into the ground anyway. The tracks, meanwhile, offer the fresh dirt of central European rallycross, and the return of Finncross, a track from the previous game which has been spruced up. </p>
<p>"It has been given a complete makeover so it's okay if you don't even recognize it," say the developers in the above trailer. "It’s a track packed with tight turns, perfect for corner bombing
so we except to see some epic battles this time too."</p>
<p>Along with these headliners, there's also a bunch of smaller updates and changes. The gamepad now rumbles, the user interface has been improved, and you can now properly invite buds to join a server from your Steam friends list. There's a small mound of performance tweaks and bug fixes too, all of which are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/501698646945826538">an update post</a> on Steam. That's also where the developers promise more bangers and raceplaces soon, with a roadmap showing that another update of similar size is planned for next month. </p>
<p>That's encouraging. Wreckfest 2 feels nice and weighty in the hands yet is quite light on actual toys to play with so far. You can read my impressions in more detail in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-review">early access review</a> but basically it's gearing up to be a solid and exciting sequel to a respected game of windshield-cracking antics. More stuff is good stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>All creative work goes through several iterations before arriving in its final form. This very post, for example, began as a little notice of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a>, before I realised Edwin had already done that. Now it's instead about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, an RPG which Nic definitely described in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">his review</a> as "operatically, hauntingly, and slightly unhingedly French".
</p>
<p>Turns out it wasn't always so, as early in development Clair Obscur was set in "a steampunk Victorian England", and there's some early footage of it in action.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Five years ago, Sandfall Interactive CEO Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">posted on Reddit</a> in search of voice actors for the project, described at the time as "a 3d modern take on the JRPG genra with western style characters". The project was called "We Lost" and Broche shared early video footage of the game, the original links to which no longer work, though it's available via reuploads.

</span></p><p>"Steampunk" equals "I dunno, put big cogs on the buildings 'n' that."
</p>
<p>One of the people who applied to be a voice actor on the game, Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, went on to instead be its lead writer. In a recent interview, she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a> about how the project changed. "The gameplay would have been similar, but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a call with investors that caused the project the change course. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Guillaume called me, and he's just like, ‘Alright, reboot. We're starting from scratch,’” she said, following a call in which potential investors told them, "You know, you can think bigger, don't hold yourself back just because you're worried about funding. If you could do what you wanted to do, what would you write?"</blockquote>
<p>There are some memorable games set in London already - a city which Nate memorably referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-legion-how-to-talk-like-a-fackin-future-fackin-cockney">"hard mode Paris"</a> - so I'm glad Clair Obscur reached for a more distinct flavour, one that Nic named in his review as "French French FRENCH IT'S FRENCH FRANCE French French French French!". Love that guy's writing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">explained on the PlayStation blog</a>, the new update adds weapon customisation for all primary weapons, letting you complete missions and pay in-game currency to unlock attachments and skins. "Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield," says the post.
</p>
<p>These newly tweakable weapons are proposed as a response to Illuminate heading towards Super Earth, and doing so with newly added enemy types. That includes "the Stingray", a flying enemy that can perform strafing runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>; "the Crescent Overseer", which can drop explosives on Helldivers behind cover; and the Fleshmob, a "Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy."
</p>
<p>"Voteless parts" is good. Good marketing, marketer.
</p>
<p>The in-game store has also been amended to offer items permanently, rather than only a rotating time-limited selection, meaning that you can now go pickup that fascist dandy cape you missed first time around. I like when developers decide to stop preying upon FOMO.
