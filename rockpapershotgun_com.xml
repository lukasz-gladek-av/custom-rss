            <p>True to the game's billing as the twistiest of duty-shooters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release date trailer appears to have leaked ahead of a possible <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> showing tonight. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will launch on 14th November, close to a month after rival Battlefield 6's release on October 10th. Also, it appears to have jet packs and mechs.</p><!--more-->
<p>The leak comes care of that ever-dependable source of military intelligence, a video advertisement that seems to have been accidentally published early. The ad has now been removed, but not before CharlieIntel spotted it and shared it on the Xeetbox, along with some <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957614174768689197?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">thoughts based on the user's own pre-release access</a>. "Just to tone down expectations, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 does not have jet packs or double jumps as part of its movement," CharlieIntel claims. Alas for Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a> players. Good news, I guess, for people who relish the 'omnimovement' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what we know of Call of Duty: Bleven for sure: it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">requires secure boot, to avoid cheaters</a>. It's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>. The campaign is set in 2035, hence the mechs and jet packs, and expands upon the global calamities unleashed in Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. It sees grizzly grumbleface David Mason chasing after an enigmatic new foe who "weaponise fear". There will probably be hallucinations and other Manchurian Candidate-esque horseplay to wash down the gadgets and gunnery.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-black-ops-7-video-features-mechs-jet-packs-and-a-release-date/">reported by VGC</a>, today's release date whoopsie corroborates a previous leak that also included a price tag for the Standard Edition - $70 or €80 - with a Vault Edition priced at $100 or €110. If legit, this means that Microsoft has still yet to cross the Rubicon and raise the game's base US price to $80, as they tried to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">until the internet started screaming at them</a>.</p>

            <p>Review scores. Who needs 'em? Well, Valve reckon Steam didn't have enough two word verdicts on games, so they've introduced a "language-specific" scoring system, which offers separate ratings based on user reviews penned in certain tongues.</p>
<p>The goal's to paint a more detailed picture of what folks in different parts of the world think of what they've played, allowing you to see at a glance whether that game you've been putting off adding to your backlog is the bees' knees among Korean-speaking players. That's provided said game meets the threshold of having 2,000 publicly visible reviews in total and at least 200 written in the specific language you're looking for.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Steam's growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game," Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904530?utm_source=SteamDB">explained</a>. "There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the overall review scores haven't been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups."</p>
<p>"When there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," they added. "The Review Score displayed to users will be based on their primary language. What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, for the same game."</p><p>So, the usual scores you're shown when you first navigate to a game's Steam page haven't gone anywhere. To see the "language-specific" scores, which are enabled by default, you'll need to head into the game's reviews section, then sort via a new drop-down menu labelled language. Below is what doing so currently shows you for shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>

<p>There's a reason I've picked that game too. Around the time the Illuminate faction invaded Super Earth, the game saw a spike in negative reviews specifically from Chinese players, rooted in an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">apparent translation mixup</a> specific to the version of the game in that language. The result was a bit of confusion as players in other regions struggled to work out why the game's overall rating had suddenly taken a hit. While scrolling back through recent reviews offered an idea of what had happened, in splitting up reviews like this, hopefully Valve have made it easier to tell when something like this has happened.</p>
<p>That'll probably be useful for developers, who'll be able to quickly see the change in sentiment among players speaking a certain language, and investigate whether the cause is something they can fix. On the other hand, there's the potential that in letting players see what certain regions think, we might get some hijinks or chicanery if folks decide to mess around in bad faith. For example, fomenting fresh culture wars by doing battle over which continent has the consensus, or otherwise trying to push verdicts in specfic directions just because of what other folks are doing.</p><p>People not using Steam reviews to offer straight-laced, in-depth analysis of a game's strengths and weaknesses? As someone who prior to getting into this profession left a sarky two line <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> review based entirely around disappointment that its character creator didn't boast an inch-based penis size slider, I can't imagine such a thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2025">Gamescom 2025</a> begins today, Tuesday August 19th, with Opening Night Live - the annual livestream showcase of trailers, teasers and release date announcements, in which helpless videogames are dragged on-stage and hacked into 90-second gobbets by Geoff Keighley. 
</p>
<p>
You can watch Gamescom Opening Night Live on this very page, care of the below video embed. The show starts at <strong>2pm EDT, 11 am PDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST</strong>, and should last around two hours, because that's approximately as long as the summoning magic can keep Geoff bound to our mortal plane. There's also a pre-show at <strong>1.30pm EDT, 10.30am PDT, 6.30pm BST, and 7.30pm CEST</strong>, but nothing noteworthy ever happens in those. Prove me wrong, host Kyle Boseman!

It's going to be an absolute festival of indignities, and what better way to add insult to injury than in the form of a dedicated RPS liveblog. I'll be writing up the announcements as they come, with input from Mark, Ollie and James. We welcome your speculations, exhilaration, outrage and consternation in the comments section. Feed the Maw!
