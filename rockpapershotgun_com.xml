        <p>17 people let go, including a senior combat designer</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to <a href="https://spr.ly/l/6010F8AdQ">a social media statement</a>, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by <a href="https://x.com/TheMarkVernon/status/1905041591141802451">this Xitter post</a>, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.)

Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">wrote Graham last year</a>. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year."
</p>
<p>
Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">being published by Amazon Games</a>, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Embracer announced plans last year to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">split themselves three ways</a> in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion</a>. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises.

<p>
Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.
