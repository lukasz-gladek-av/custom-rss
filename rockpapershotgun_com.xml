            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> will get at least one more significant game update, says Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, mere months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eric-barone-the-guy-who-cant-stop-updating-stardew-valley-says-the-words-i-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2">stating</a> that he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy." It'll be called update 1.7, and the trimness of the numbering implies that it'll be a large one. For context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">Stardew Valley update 1.6</a> brought eight player PC co-op, new crops, a lot more NPC dialogue, a mastery system, new pets, and the ability to give those pets hats (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-putting-hats-on-your-pets-asks-stardew-valley-creator">caused a few problems</a>). 
</p>
<p>"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">wrote on Xitter</a> over the weekend. "No release date, no estimate. But it's happening."

</p><p>Barone is theoretically also working on a brand new game, the more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">combat-focussed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, but Stardew Valley keeps luring him back, for there is always something else to fix or introduce, however daft. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," he said in May. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas." 
</p>
<p>In Barone's defence, if I had made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games">fourth best-selling premium PC game of all time</a>, I would feel in no great rush to move on from it. I would tinker for years. Well, I mean, I would actually take a lot of holidays. But in between all those trips to Alton Towers and when not playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> in my bedroom-sized caramel fondue, I would do plenty of tinkering. Ah, I imagine George R. R. Martin wishes he could be updating the old GOT novels instead of writing The Winds Of Winter.

        <p>Team Cherry confirm final release timings and pricepoints</p>

            <p>Team Cherry have confirmed release times and price points for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. It'll cost $19.99, €19.99 and ¥2300 at launch on Thursday 4th September, with pricing for other regions such as the UK to follow. As an indication, the above pricepoints equate to around £17, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged £19.99 for it, purely for the sake of symmetry.
</p>
<p>It's traditional among games journalists to illustrate pricepoints in terms of high street chain cups of coffee. But this is Silksong, a game anticipated as fervently as the ancient Mayans once anticipated the coming of an eclipse, so I will resort to more ornate means of comparison: Silksong will cost you 4200000th as much as a B-52 Stratofortress. It will cost you three-sixteenths of your soul on a rainy Friday, or two-sixteenths if the sun is out. It will cost you considerably less than they could probably charge for it. I'm not saying we should be grateful, mind, but we can breathe a sigh of a relief that this isn't being published by EA, Take-Two or Microsoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The game will launch on 7am PT, 10am ET, 3pm BST, and 4pm CEST this Thursday. This means that North American players can take the whole day off so as to rise and shove their gloating faces into Hornet's adventure, very first thing. You won't even have to shower first, you bastards. Seething Brits and Europeans must twiddle their thumbs in apoplexy till mid-afternoon, while the poor, sleepless Japanese seemingly won't get access till 11pm Tokyo time, if I'm converting the timezones correctly.
</p>
<p>James was recently able to actually play Silksong at Gamescom, finding it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">both enjoyable and familiar</a>. "The upside of playing it safe is that absolutely nothing has compromised what made the first game's action a tactile pleasure: its abnormally fine-tuned controls and pin-sharp audio/visual feedback on hits and jumps," James wrote.
</p><p>We had a bit of a ride with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Back in 2017, John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-review">recommended that people play Ori and the Blind Forest</a> instead. This caused quite the hullabaloo over the subsequent eight years. My sage and considered verdict in hindsight is that they're both mid and you should play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>. Here's to another eight years!</p>

        <p>According to Dee Keyes, the unofficial Oblivion remake's "become less a passion project and more of a crunch project"</p>

            <p>A long-standing member of unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s development team has claimed the project is being "rushed out the door", and that its previously stated 2025 release goal is "pointless and unachievable".</p>
<p>These claims were made by modder Dee Keyes in a Twitter post put up over the same weekend that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">showed off its opening fifteen minutes</a> as part of Elder Scrolls modding showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CreationModCon/featured">Creation Mod Con</a>. Keyes is currently listed as a world designer on the <a href="https://skyblivion.com/the-team/">team page of Skyblivion's website</a>, having previously served as level design department lead, and has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV2yDO7V8SQ">this dev diary</a> posted to project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel's YouTube channel in 2021.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Within the last 2-3 years the Skyblivion project has become less a passion project and more of a crunch project," Keyes wrote. "Where we used to explore options and put our heart and soul into an aspect of development, we're now being told left, right, and center that it doesn't need to be anything special or the usual 'no one is gonna notice this' excuse for rushing and laziness. It became harder and harder to talk to [project lead] Rebel about problems the project has or how little the developers are being told about lead decisions." </p>
<p>Keyes goes on to argue that announcing a 2025 release goal for the mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-skyblivion-gets-a-2025-release-window-and-new-trailer">back in 2023</a> was a "massive mistake", claiming that it was driven by YouTuber and Skyblivion implementation lead Heavy Burns not wanting "to make another trailer unless it was a release[sic] date trailer". They go on to allege that Heavy Burns has taken on a much more prominent development role at Rebel's request, having been originally brought in to make trailers and dev diary videos, to the point they argue it "now feels like to all the devs that he's the one in charge". Keyes accuses Heavy Burns of dismissing their input, as well as gaslighting them and accusing them of being difficult to work with.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"In the last few months it has been impossible for me or [other] developers to convince Rebelzize that this release date is not possible," Keyes continued. "After a last ditch effort to ask one of the lead devs who was also stressed by the project's mismanagement to voice the concerns, only for them to be ignored and forced to leave too, I felt like my time at Skyblivion had come to an end." They conclude by again accusing Rebel and Heavy Burns of working with the goal of the team's efforts being "rushed out of the door" to meet a "pointless and unachievable release date".</p>
<p>"We weren't asking for extra time to add extra features," Keyes added in a <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1962015089457774602">reply to their initial post</a>. "Just the time to complete the MVP [minimum viable product] but instead it seemed like the MVP became more and more minimum by the day in order to make December."</p>
<p>I've contacted Keyes, Rebel, Heavy Burns, and the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>A couple of Skyblivion devs have already responded to Keyes' post being shared to the mod's Discord server and Reddit page. "We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," wrote Skyblivion communications specialist Evan T. Flatt on the latter platform. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it—our goal has been to have it ready for release this year.</p><p>"Now, what is 'ready'? That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>

</span></p><p>"Discussions will be had about the points brought up," Skyblivion navmesh developer Novarleeir <a href="https://discord.com/channels/239801644076892160/239801644076892160/1411834128478896301">added on Discord</a>. "For right now, the goal stands at 2025. At the end of the day, we'd like to provide a fun and entertaining experience for existing and incoming fans of Oblivion/Elder Scrolls."</p>
<p>In light of Keyes' post, an number of Skyblivion fans have posted in both places that they'd have no issue with the modders delaying Skyblivion out of this year and taking extra time, if that's judged by the team to be necessary. Given how important a trouble-free launch will likely be for Skyblivion, following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">bug issues</a> fellow massive mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> had on release last year, I'm very much inclined to agree.</p><p>Prior to Skyblivion's Creation Mod Con cameo this weekend just gone, project lead Rebel told RPS regarding the mod's release: "I'd say recent developments made us come closer to a potential date announcement, but we will be able to share more about that at a later date."</p>
