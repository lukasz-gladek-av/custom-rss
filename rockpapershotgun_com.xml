            <p>A new story trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> Overture expansion shows us more of the "legendary stalker" the player will be following through the snowy surroundings of Krat. The lore is served up raw with a heavy garnishing of opaque chatter that explains absolutely nothing. But I hear that's how you cook a soulslike story. Come watch and see if you can understand more of the stalker's words than I do. You probably will if you recognise the classical tune playing underneath it all.</p>

<p>The track that plays during the trailer is a classical cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdRx1OMpJQ">"Feel"</a> from the base game, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzlQlUtlQ40">play on gramophone in-game</a>. It's described in lore-ish item notes as a "a song that quietly comforts the dark." I haven't played Lies Of P, so I don't know if the song is significant to the game's story in any other way, or if this is just the developers capitalising on a fan favourite from the original soundtrack (let me know). Either way, it's a nice tune.</p>
<p>The DLC will see you following and fighting alongside a swordswoman dressed in what looks like an officer's cavalry uniform of the era. This stalker and the puppety protagonist seem to be out of sync in one part of the trailer, but come together at the end to stand in front of a manor that might be the Rose Estate - a charity house for orphans that was teased in the base game. It's possible this prequel expansion will investigate the <a href="https://lies-of-p.fandom.com/wiki/Rose_Estate_Incident,_Left_As_A_Mystery">shady goings-on</a> of that building.</p>
<p>The expansion was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-the-absence-of-bloodborne-on-pc-we-get-a-snowy-expansion-for-lies-of-p">announced a couple of weeks ago with a boss-dripping trailer</a> during PlayStation's State of Play event. It's due to be released some time in summer this year, we're told. I like to think that Ed (RPS in peace) is out there somewhere, looking at this and wondering if it's worth dipping back into the world of Belle Époque marionettes. He liked the game a lot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">when he reviewed it</a>. Alas, I cannot know his feelings. We cannot cross the bounds of time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sorcerous cardgame <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> and slot machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck Be A Landlord</a> have been reclassified as fit for people aged 12 years and over by the Pan European Games Information board, after they were initially slapped with an 18 rating for "glamorising... the simulation of gambling".</p>
<p>PEGI have made the change following a successful appeal against the 18 rating by Balatro's European publisher Sold Out and Luck Be A Landlord's Switch publisher Fangamer. They're also going to develop "a more granular set of classification criteria" for games that reference gambling, to distinguish jingling parodies of rentier capitalism from the one arm bandits found in actual casinos.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To catch you up, Balatro was pulled from certain digital stores in March last year after it was recategorised as an 18+ game. In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">statement</a>, the publishers attributed this to an unspecified rating's board "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bdtmlg/ama_i_am_localthunk_developer_and_artist_for/">comments on Reddit</a> shortly after, the game's developer Localthunk confirmed that the ratings board in question was PEGI. "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," he wrote. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/googles-inconsistent-app-store-stance-on-gambling-comes-under-fire/">banned from Google Play in 13 countries</a> in August 2023 after the game was found to be in violation of the platform's policies about gambling. In January this year, Google <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-luck-landlord-google-play-store-gambling-mobile-1851731303">threatened to ban the game globally</a> unless developers TrampolineTales updated its listing to specify that it "contains gambling".
</p>
<p>
All of which may seem ridiculous if you've played either game. To draw some basic distinctions, Balatro features poker cards and poker-style mechanics, but does not involve the wagering of real money, and is fundamentally a deckbuilding roguelike featuring Tarot cards and bizarre Joker modifiers. Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, uses a slot machine format for the purposes of satire, and again doesn't involve the wagering of real money.</p>
<p>I can, however, see the case for being suspicious of either game, both because there are superficial correspondences with casino machines and so forth, and because video game reward and randomisation systems at large have a certain kinship with gambling. Games like EA's football trading card sim Ultimate Team thrive on microtransaction and lootbox mechanics that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/meet-the-men-hiding-their-fifa-ultimate-team-addiction-from-their-families">may lead to addiction</a>, but you don't have to be pouring in hard cash to get hooked.
</p>
<p>
PEGI now <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">agree</a> with the criticism of each game's 18 rating. Regarding Balatro, the complaints board have "concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating." As for Luck Be A Landlord, they've similarly reasoned that "although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills and the game can therefore be rated PEGI 12."
</p>
<p>
They're also planning to revise their rating system a little to make finer distinctions between, say, games that depict poker and games in which you actually play poker for cash rewards. "The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process," the statement continues. "PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.
</p>
<p>
"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," it goes on. "On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."
</p>
<p>
I like that Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord are no longer being filed alongside the sweaty fruit machines that line the toilet queue at Weatherspoons. That said, I am naturally a little wary of the possibility that PEGI might compromise too much with companies who attempt to split hairs between "simulation, teaching and glamorisation". As Nic put it in Slack just now, it's easy to imagine less scrupulous publishers "trying to ludonarrative the fuck out of their lootboxes" and piling on "mitigating" elements so as to get their gambling experiences into the hands of kiddies. I'm interested to read a breakdown of PEGI's new criteria, once they've finalised it.

<p>I’ve been trying the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirreled-away">Squirreled Away</a>, and for some reason it keeps wanting me to play it as some kinda 2024-as-heck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game. At this, I make several rapid sniffing-like movements, then scarper adeptly yet dismissively up the nearest tree. It’s just far more fun to treat this as a casual squirrel sim, or, at the very least, a platformer where you occasionally need to steal some strawberries.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Look, I’ve played enough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to appreciate the pleasures of hewing a home together from Mother Gaia’s offcuts. But Squirreled Away’s scavenging and building don’t really do anything to explore beyond familiar stick-to-plank-to-hut tropes, even with the briefly amusing sight of your fluffy protagonist lugging a tiny rock axe on his back. It’s not like you’re crafting to survive anything, either: there are no elements to endure and the only consequence of letting your stamina run out is an inability to swing your tools. No enemies to be scared of either, unless you’re that American cop who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZPplp7wGso">magdumped an acorn</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend using what the demo gives you for gathering purposes – a roamable forest, freeform climbing abilities, zero fall damage – to engage in a spot of chilled-out tree rat parkour. Now <em>this</em> is a good time. There’s a perfectly judged stickiness to how you latch on to bark and branches, and many of the latter look like they were placed specifically for daring cross-canopy leaps. Screenshots for the full game present the tantalising possibility of eventually gaining a dinky hang glider, which might be the one thing in all of existence that could get me back to crafting. You will believe a squirrel can fly.</p>
<p>Down on the ground, the capacity for hijinks is diminished, though I did a smile at my expectedly terrible attempts to strum a guitar, and at how readily I could destroy camping equipment in pursuit of rare golden nuts. Squirreled Away definitely leans further towards cosiness than chaos – it’s not exactly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With a Gun</a>, with or without the gun – but it also has a mischievous side that’s at least passingly fun to explore. When, again, you’re not filling a recipe checklist of twigs and pebbles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Well crack my knuckles and call me Roger, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> has only gone and announced another character to be released as DLC in early April.

<p>As you can see, the lady in red has returned. The snarky sister will be released April 3rd (or March 31st for those who buy the whole season pass in advance). She's the first character of the fighting game's season 2 DLC, with another three biff-buddies to follow - one in summer, another in autumn, and the final fisticuffer in winter. Two new stages are also due to be added in this DLC. </p>
<p>Anna is a long-running Tekken fighter characterised by a love for bazookas and a hatred of her sister and fellow Iron Fist contender Nina. She likes espresso, red wine, and the mouse Jerry from Tom And Jerry cartoons. I'm not making this up for a gag. It is what the <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Williams">always-entertaining Tekken wiki</a> says about her. I don't play as this character, or her sister Nina, so I'm not fully clued in about her high-heel headstomps and gut-blasting gunshots, or her various somersaults and scissorkicks, but the trailer shows a lot of familiar-looking launchers, feints, and open-handed chops. I like her new hairdo.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been out for a year now, and Bandai Namco are boasting that they've sold three million copies. That's three million people who want to beat you up - you must have really annoyed them. I thought this instalment was pretty good when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">battered my opponents and never ever lost in our review</a>. Although I was disappointed none of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> characters were available at launch. One year on we still haven't seen signs of bull-fighting Spanish reprobate Miguel or tearful shin-cracker Josie. I'm not confident the latter will return, but I hold onto hope for my other favourite, Lei Wulong. In Tekken 7 the kung fu cop was released relatively early as DLC goes. I'd love to see him this year too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
