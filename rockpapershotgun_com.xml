            <p>Young'un James Bond game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> has had a little redo of its PC system requirements, after "an internal miscommunication" – according to developers IO Interactive – led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-system-requirements">last week’s specs</a> reveal containing some whoopsies. "We’re sorry for the confusion this caused and appreciate everyone who brought it to our attention", <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151">sayeth the company’s tXeet</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the requisite RAM for recommended settings has dropped from 32GB to 16GB – happily so, for anyone putting off an upgrade while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">memory prices are off the charts</a> – while VRAM has been lowered across the board, and the minimum Intel CPU listing has been amended from the fictional Core i5-9500K to the all too real Core i5-9500. See? It’s all good news really. No need to point out how I wrote about the original specs list without mentioning any of these.</p>
<p>Here’s the updated specs:</p>

<p>I did <em>notice</em>, at the time, the discrepancy of asking for a 12GB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a> while listing the 8GB RTX 3060 Ti as a recommended GPU. But then the relationship between VRAM and games performance is so inconsistent – and the people who argue that 8GB can’t run anything tougher than Puzzle Bobble are so irritating – that I let it slide. No defence on failing to clock how IOI invented an Intel CPU, mind. Ballsed that one right up, I did, and now I go to join the devs for ten nights of penance sleeping in the Apology Cave.</p>
<p>007: First Light is out on May 27th. IOI also say that "additional performance targets will be shared closer to launch", hopefully with STRENUOUSLY FACT-CHECKED insights into what you might need to run it at resolutions higher than 1080p.</p>

            <p>
LinkedIn today is a terrible den of web3+ grifters, obsolete CVs, frog-boiling pressure to buy a subscription, and scurrilous journalists hunting for leaks in job listings. But every now and then it comes good. For example, there’s a discussion underway between various senior developers, including current and former staff of Remedy, Ubisoft and Naughty Dog, about the causes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/crunch">crunch</a>, aka ruinous overwork. 
</p>
<p>
There’s a pervading atmosphere of former triple-A blokes warming up their soapboxes for a GDC talk down the line, and a certain amount of insider jargon about “pipelines” and so forth – somebody should probably do a piece on the etymology of “pipelines” in software development. But it’s otherwise a useful chat. There is minimal indulgence of the old saw about crunch being unavoidable because ‘passionate’ creative people are inherently prone to burning themselves out. The emphasis is on crunch as a structural phenomenon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The chinwag’s instigator is Novaquark technical director John Walther, a former senior technical artist at Ubisoft, where he worked on the Anvil engine used by Assassin’s Creed and Ghost Recon. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnw91_the-big-reason-its-so-important-for-every-activity-7414836160482553856-0yqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">kicks off with the hopeful assertion</a> that “the big reason it's so important for every studio to improve their pipelines and processes right now is because of the industry trending away from crunch.” Walther continues that “crunch has been used to make some of the biggest blockbuster AAAs but it's not sustainable as it burns out dev teams” and as such, has been “universally rejected across the games industry.”
</p>
<p>
Less positively, he feels that “many companies are turning back to crunch as it's the only way they know to find success”, with “pressure coming from publishers tightening their grip”. This may “work in the short term but the long term solution is improving pipelines and processes”. Walther argues that “scoping down” is “the easy and boring solution” to this. “I think we should continue to make ambitious games, we just need to work in a more efficient and organized manner.” I’m not sure I recognise the implied link between “ambition” and sheer production scale here, but I appreciate the sentiment.
</p><p>
People responding to the post include Robert Krekel, former audio director at Naughty Dog, who is now audio director at Atomic Arcade. “While crunch is often blamed on poor production, over-scoping, or broken processes which all absolutely contribute, there’s another factor that doesn’t get discussed nearly enough: ego,” he argues. “When you put a large number of high performers on the same team, there’s often an unspoken pressure to define what the 'industry standard' is in your specific discipline not because it’s required to ship the product, but because individuals want to be seen as the best at what they do by their peers. It’s an uncomfortable reality at studios like Naughty Dog. The studio attracts people with that mindset by design.”
</p>
<p>
As such, Krekel thinks studio managers need to both fix “broken processes” and “give people the autonomy to push boundaries, exercise real agency, and feel genuine pride in their work, while also putting guardrails in place to protect them from themselves.”</p>
<p>Going by his comments, I would suggest that Naughty Dog especially still need to undergo some more general reflection about whether they want to cultivate this behaviour from the point of recruitment onward. This is assuming a fair bit of good faith on the part of bosses and parent company Sony, of course. Naughty Dog have long had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">reputation</a> for crunch culture - they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crunch-returns-to-naughty-dog-for-xmas-as-intergalactic-devs-work-overtime-on-a-demo-for-sony-claims-report">made headlines recently</a> for requiring developers to work longer hours on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet in the run-up to Xmas.
</p>
<p>
Josh DiCarlo – former Insomniac Games principal character technical director, and current creative technology director of Persona AI – feels that “crunch is not a SCOPE problem, it's - at its core - an institutional problem and it's almost entirely avoidable.” He begins by comparing his experiences of game development to his time in the film biz, commenting that “I've worked on films from beginning to end that had virtually no overtime - I have never heard of a modern AAA title that didn't have a soul crushing crunch period.”
</p><p>
“The problem is that solving crunch requires more than a verbal commitment from the studio to avoid it,” DiCarlo argues. “It requires buy-in and investment at ALL levels. To develop streamlined, holistic, automated pipelines that tackle asset publishing, versioning, and review material without reliance on individual contributors to follow elaborate processes. To enforce regular standardized reviews to buyoff and approve assets. To meticulously track development in a project and asset-centric way rather than a ticket centric one - and to have a financial consequence (i.e. OVERTIME).”</p>
<p>Some more context: Insomniac have seen their share of crunch, but they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insomniacs-ted-price-games-studios-must-break-the-habit-of-brute-forcing-through-problems">caused a stir</a> back in 2021 for allegedly avoiding mandatory overwork during development of Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.
</p>
<p>
Remedy’s principal audio designer Ville Petteri Sorsa has the snappiest reply. “Crunch is the easiest workaround for failures in management and project planning,” he says. “It usually emerges as a response to financial pressure and deadlines that were never realistic to begin with.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve crunched myself for various employers. It has always been due to some combination of inadequate project structure, not enough resources to do work I'm proud of, and putting myself under unnecessary pressure to deliver quantifiable results.</p>
<p>My workplace experiences are very different from those of game developers labouring on just the one release for years, milestone to milestone, amid a changing industry. How about you? Any memories of crunch - or successfully avoiding crunch - to share? Some follow-up material: back in 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outsourcing-doesnt-solve-crunch">ran a video</a> about how even companies that avoid crunch may outsource it to studios overseas.

            <p>A group of modders who got multiplayer servers running for Rockstar's schoolyard mischief simulator Bully <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bully-online-sees-modders-have-another-go-at-schoolyard-multiplayer-mayhem-arrives-in-paid-early-access-this-year">late last year</a> have suddenly pulled all traces of their creation offline. The project's been shutdown about a month after release, and thus far its creators haven't offered an explanation as to why, beyond emphasising that this outcome wasn't what they hoped would happen.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Bully Online project is shutting down forever," reads an announcement which popped up on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1275210273481031752/1449940958794747985/1461027105054789814">Discord server</a> of project lead and YouTuber Swegta yesterday afternoon. "Which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours: our official Bully Online server (on swegta.com) will be shutdown, development of scripts for Bully Online will stop, the source code will be removed from swegta.com, all our webpages referring to it will be removed, the launcher downloads will taken down, and all Bully Online account data will be permanently deleted."</p>
<p>As you'll also be dutifully informed if you head over to <a href="https://swegta.com/">that website</a>, Swegta's set to make a statement about the shutdown on January 21st, with this looking set to come in YouTube video form. Outside of that, all the mod's team currently said regarding the reasoning behind the shutdown in that Discord post is this: "For now though, know this was not something we wanted." They added that Bully Online players had 24 hours from the announcement going live to hop on, take a final stroll in the mod, and backup any screenshots they want to keep.</p>
<p>While we'll have to wait and see if the YouTuber's full statement confirms as much, the whole thing smells very much like some Lionel Hutzes have been in touch and politely delivered a message amounting to 'please knock this off'. Rockstar and Take-Two have a lengthy history of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">dishing out such things</a> to modding projects, even if the company's general stance on modding has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-launch-official-roleplay-mods-store-where-you-can-spend-67-to-turn-gta-into-euro-truck-simulator-2">grown a bit more complex</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>If that is the case, it's sad to see a mod that sounded when I first heard about it back in November like it'd been in the works for a good while meeting such a rapid demise.</p>
