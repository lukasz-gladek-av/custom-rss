            <p>Oblivion's a notoriously buggy game, so it probably shouldn't have been too much of a surprise that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> was also pretty damn buggy. While a lot of those bugs are the kind of charming nonsense TES 4 is beloved for, Bethesda and Virtuos have now confirmed that the remaster's got two updates incoming to fix its more serious problems.</p>
<p>Having scrolled through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for the first of these updates, which releases in Steam beta today, there's one fix that's stood out, because the thing it outlines has been haunting my dreams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first of these, Update 1.1, releases via Steam beta on June 5 and focuses on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes". It'll be available across all platforms as of June 11.</p>
<p>The second update, meanwhile, will aim to improve the game's performance. It doesn't have a date yet, just a "we will share more details when we are able".</p>
<p>One of Update 1.1's quest fixes is designed to stop "Vicente Valtieri losing his hair" during the Dark Brotherhood mission A Knife In The Dark. I ran into this glitch while reviewing the game, and while it wasn't that much of an inconvenience, returning from a mission to find the usually dapper vampire assassin had gone full Ross Kemp was definitely an experience. Especially when his hair then miraculously grew back by the next time I visited for a chat.</p>
<p>Among the patch's other interesting fixes are ones for High Chancellor Ocato's "arms not animating", Thieves Guild NPCs just not showing up at all, and Savlian Matius getting stuck after the castle courtyard fight when you're re-taking Kvatch. I think I narrowly avoided that last one, as I recall Matius seemingly very reticent to follow my hero into the castle, despite all his chatter about time being of the essence in saving the count.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> you ride a magical blade across shifting dunes of golden sand. It looks like a combination of the jetbike desert-crossing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> and the meditative hiking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a>. Which makes sense when you learn the art director from the latter game is leading the team. I like the look of it. Surfing is cool and so are swords, so I'm happy to see it's coming out in just a couple months, as announced at last night's State of Play show by PlayStation.</p>

<p>It's due out on August 19th this year, say developers Giant Squid. You might know them as the creators of peaceful ocean diving game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abzu">Abzu</a>, or the speedy running and slick archery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>. To my shame I have played neither of these. But then, neither of them has you kickflipping across a mysterious fantasy landscape on a giant medieval weapon. I think maybe this is the one for me, yes.</p>
<p>When the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-new-desert-surfing-adventure-from-the-devs-behind-abzu-and-journey">first announced in 2023</a>, the sword you ride was described as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one". As for the story, it seems as mystical as the game looks.</p>
<p>"You are the Wraith," explained creative director Matt Nava in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-sword-of-the-sea-a-new-game-from-giant-squid/">a blog</a>, "resurrected in a desolate world and tasked with restoring life to it as you explore submerged ruins and the vibrant, varied cultures within. Surf through sinking tombs, mysterious shipwrecks, and petrified battlefields â€“ and bring giant shoals of fish and creatures back in the process. But beware- this land is also home to massive leviathans that will stand in your way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
