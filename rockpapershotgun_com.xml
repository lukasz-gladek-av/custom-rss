The passage of time is unfortunately an unstoppable thing, and I seem to have blinked and five years have passed since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. In the intervening period, a sort-of-sequel was released simply titled Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 - now just called Call of Duty: Warzone, too - and the single, bountiful map players War upon has changed several times over. Yesterday on March 10th, the day Warzone officially released back in 2020, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> shared a teaser trailer confirming that the game's original map Verdansk will be making a comeback.
</p>

<p>
The trailer, which you can check out below, is set to Nat King Cole's classic Unforgettable, all while different characters in a range of military gear lovingly look at dirt, embrace shot-up walls, and cry over the return of Verdansk.

<p>
To be honest, it feels like a bit of a tone deaf trailer given the general state of the world, but I suppose Call of Duty has never been known for treating these kinds of things sensitively. 
</p>
<p>
It was thought that season 3 of Warzone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> would be arriving later this month on March 20th, but last week the official Call of Duty X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">confirmed that it will instead be coming April 3rd</a>. That's when you'll be able to jump back into Verdansk, too.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is obviously following in Fortnite's footsteps here, given that Epic's more popular battle royale did the exact same thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-og-is-here-bringing-back-planes-hamster-balls-tilted-towers-and-more-over-the-next-four-weeks">back in 2023</a> by bringing back a whole bunch of features from the earliest iteration of the game, including its original map. Fortnite found a lot of success with that move, something I'm sure Activision will hope repeats with the return of Verdansk to Warzone.

We all know what's coming up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us</a> season 2, right? I mean, everyone knows what happens quite early on in the game, because it was a pretty controversial narrative choice so everyone and their mum has spoiled it. I haven't played it myself and I know what happens, but it seems like streaming service Max is happy to pretend that everything is peaches and cream (more or less) in their adaptation.
</p>
<p>
A new trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> season 2 dropped over the weekend that is full of drama and light on spoilers, which is why I'm staying quiet too, but it has been funny watching all of these trailers knowing that they're lying just a little bit.

For the most part, season 2 look like more of the same; it's dark, it's depressing, everyone's angry all the time, and, yes, there are still not-quite-zombies to be worried about. It's not too long until you can watch the show, as it's set to premiere on Max this coming April 13th, with a weekly release every Sunday for a total of seven episodes. UK viewers will be able to check out the first episode the day after, April 14th, where it'll be shown on Sky and its streaming service NOW.
</p>
<p>
April will be a big month for The Last of Us: Part Two in general, as the remastered version of the sequel is also set to arrive on PC April 3rd. Originally the PC release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would have required you to sign in with a PSN account</a>, despite that causing so many issues with previous PlayStation releases on PC. PlayStation has since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped that requirement</a> for The Last of Us: Part Two, alongside a few other games, so that at least knocks off one reason for the review bombs. Here's hoping it also avoids <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1s-pc-port-is-being-ripped-apart-by-steam-reviewers">the bugs and performances issues that plagued the PC release of Part One</a>.
