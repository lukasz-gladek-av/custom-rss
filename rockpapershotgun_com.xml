            <p>
Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has posted a sprawling video about the development of Anthem, EA and BioWare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">ill-fated</a> mech <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> shoot-me-do. We've heard about this remarkably torrid period in the RPG developer's existence from other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-never-grasped-dragon-ages-value-as-an-rpg-says-inquisition-writer">ex-BioWare honchos</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-cancelled-rumour">anonymous sources</a>, but perhaps never quite this extensively: the video tops out at an hour long, and this is just part one.

<p>
There's a bit of gossip and speculation from Darrah, but it's an engrossing listen, assuming you're not absolutely sick of the tale of how EA's GaaSy ambitions screwed up BioWare. Here are some highlights based on a quick skimplay.</p>
<p>Darrah begins with the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>, at which point EA were apparently really hammering home the "single player games are dead" angle, and trying to get BioWare onto live service gaming. It was at this point that Mass Effect 3 game director Casey Hudson pitched Dylan, the early codename for Anthem. EA higher-ups apparently loved the talk of a new approach to multiplayer storytelling, but the Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams were, Darrah continues, less than thrilled by the Dylan team's suggestion that BioWare had to move with the times.
</p>
<p>
Darrah himself is ambivalent about Dylan's initial pitch, calling it vague. This vagueness created problems in 2014 when Hudson left the studio, with nobody else quite sure what the game was supposed to be. According to Darrah, too much time was spent at this stage defining the game against the likes of Borderlands and Destiny.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, there were arguments that Dragon Age 4's development team should be reassigned to the Dylan project. Other spats include a fiery response to a particular demo from Patrick Soderlund, CEO of Battlefield developers DICE, and negative feedback from EA to a perceived reduction in the number of Anthem exosuits, or Javelins, based on some WIP figures.
</p>
<p>
As for the name, there was a push to call it Javelins, but EA preferred "Beyond", only to discover that Sony already had a trademark for this. Darrah notes humorously in passing that the original Dragon Age didn't even have dragons when it was given that name.
</p>
<p>
The video brings us up to approximately late 2017, when Darrah himself became involved with Anthem. Look out for the second part down the line. Thanks to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-darrah-talks-about-the-early-development-of-anthem.1263345/">Resetera</a> for passing this on.

            <p>Stardock and Oxide Games have announced Ashes Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/singularity">Singularity</a> II - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ashes-of-the-singularity-2">Ashes Of The Singularity 2</a>, as people who hate unnecessary extra keyboard presses may prefer - sequel to the sci-fi real-time strategy game Brendy called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-review">"gorgeous, but plain"</a>, adding "there's nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better". The new RTS aims to improve that verdict by introducing: humans. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, but perhaps it'll work out for them.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction," observes Stardock CEO and sometime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wardell">Gamergator</a> Brad Wardell in the announcement release. "Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines." The battling bipeds will join the returning robot and bionic post-human factions in continent-sized scrums encompassing thousands of units. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game will release in 2026, a decade after the first game, and in a show of pure commercial poetry, its story also takes place a decade after the events of the first. Remember to cite this next time somebody tells you that games can't be art.</p>
<p>The new chapter puts you in charge of the United Earth Forces, "a powerful human alliance forged between NATO, China, and Russia, determined to reclaim Earth's territories - including Australia and Africa - as well as vital outposts on planets and moons across the solar system, all previously overtaken by relentless AI and formidable Post-Humans." We'll prise the Sydney Opera House from their stinking cyborg fingers, and paint the surface of Pluto with those quarrelsome brains-in-jars.</p>
<p>Ashes Of The Singularity 2 is the work of a "significantly expanded" dev team, and will feature co-operative and competitive multiplayer together with a skirmish mode. There's a lot more backstory on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intense%20skirmishes%20against%20intelligent%20computer%20opponents">Steam page</a>, together with the announcement that "this is a game that celebrates your strategic skills and rewards you for understanding that logistics, planning and terrain matter." Total Annihilation diehards rejoice, possibly. "We're determined to make the BIG both simple and fun," adds <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3499790/view/547868787733430463?l=english">a dev diary</a> that delves just a little deeper into the base-building aspect.</p>
<p>After being kicked around by Brendy, the original Ashes fell afoul of Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer). In a feature about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/learning-to-love-imbalance-in-strategy-games">learning to love imbalance in strategy games</a>, he noted that "its bland campaign reveals its focus: it serves only to get people into the multiplayer component." Did you play the multiplayer? I have to confess, this game passed me by.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-humans-are-revolting-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-2-the-latest-planet-scale-rts-from-oxide-games]]></content:encoded>
