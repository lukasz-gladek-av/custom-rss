            <p>Reader, I'm getting some serious de ja vu from the the poster for <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">Liberation Escape Rooms</a> 'Castle Of Conundrums' experience, but I'm having trouble placing it. I don't <em>think</em> I've been to this escape room before, never having visited the town of Southaven, Mississippi. Perhaps I should go? The <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">reviews are</a> positively glowing. "Very exciting and unique escape rooms," writes Anna R. Five stars! "Today's game in the Castle just blew us away," enthuses Tracey S. Five stars again! An unmissable experience by all accounts. And yet, I'd feel woefully unequiped to take on the Castle Of Conundrums if I cannot solve the much more pressing conundrum at hand.</p>

<p>"The king and his knights are on a quest to protect the crown. While they are away, a new and formidable threat appears just beyond the castle walls," reads the lore blurb. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Worst possible time this could have happened. "Can you prove your worthiness in Merlin’s trials, become a knight, and defend the kingdom?". Wait. What? Why is Merlin holding trials when the castle is in danger from a threat - need I remind you - that is <em>just beyond the castle walls</em>?! There's no time for your classic chicanery, Merlsy! We need knights <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A familiar set-up, no doubt. But no, no. That's not it. There's something <em>else</em> familiar about the poster for Liberation Escape Rooms Presents The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5. Why, it's that plaque in the top left, isn't it? The breastplate. The crossed swords. Why, that's definitely Dark Knight Armoury's <a href="https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/product/heraldic-eagle-breastplate-with-two-decorative-swords-wall-plaque/">Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque</a>! The only problem is that I've never laid eyes on Dark Knight Armoury's Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque, so it must be something else.</p>
<p>"We have done a handful of escape rooms in the Memphis area and this was by far one of the best!!!!!" writes Alicia B. Five stars again! Can you not see the subterfuge occurring right before your eyes, Alicia? You and your other five star compatriots? Are you so swayed by Liberation Escape Rooms' - by all accounts - unbeatable customer service that you've willingly blinded yourself to the lies contained in the poster for The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5? Is it left solely to me to unpack its uncanny familiarity; the sole possessor of open eyes in a land where gummy-lidded herds chew mindlessly on opiatic cud like newborn foals?</p>
<p>Hang on. Hang on. It's the bloody font, isn't it? Classic <a href="https://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/bluebeard/">bluebeard</a>. I'd recognise you anywhere. Phew.</p>

            <p>“The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne," wrote Chaucer. But you'd trained hard with that crossbow, and let any man in bolting distance try to claim you hadn't mastered it. You never wanted to go to war, but the crops were failing, you'd just lost your seventeenth child to medium-pox, and dark portents swirled on the horizon like curdled goat's milk. Also, the actual goat's milk was curdling.</p>
<p>In that tent, you'd communed with angels, and the righteous fury of all the heavens coursed through every fibre of your being. You'd likely die today, you knew. But you'd die knowing you did all you could to put this fair kingdom to rights. You step outside, breathe deep the morning air, and immediately eat a point blank pump-action shotgun to the torso. Then you lose both your legs to the tank shell. Then someone runs over your corpse with a dirtbike. Bloody typical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> made memeish waves when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">first teased last February</a>, and while it'd be easy to write it off as just a one-note joke based on an inherently goofy power imbalance (you have guns and tanks, they have swords and horses), there does look to be a bit more occurring here. It's a four-player co-op action game where you'll be also able to command armies a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a>, and build fortifications on the fly a la, uh, Fortnite I guess. I estimate the simple joys of shotgun vs pikeman will last for about forty minutes, but assuming the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> layer holds up, I'm still very much into this.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on the single-save honour mode, and Kingmakers looks to have its own honour mode of sorts, too, should you fancy it. As mentioned in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2109770/discussions/0/4340977379955918858/">dev Q&amp;A</a>, you'll be able to use a sword and shield, so it sounds like you can theoretically ignore the helicopters and grenade launchers and just get stuck in the melee. I'm not sure why you would, mind. Honour is for chumps that didn't bring enough helicopters. Kingmakers releases in early access October 8th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this week, one of my industry peers James Bentley (they're over at that other site about PC games, GamerPCs I think it's called) put out a video essay titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/KtqrklovNHI?si=niPEfgfN3OxDxMmF">I Can Guarantee You This Game is Going to be Underrated</a>". Trusting in James as a critic of varied and interesting taste, I clicked through and found that yeah, they're right, it probably will be. However, I also get to write about indie PC games for a living, so I'd like to do my part in telling you about this strange, point-and-click/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/decade">Decade</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I don't think Decade is an easy, or perhaps comfortable game to describe, given its heavy themes. The game follows four children, specifically the four last children on the entire planet, the only survivors after metallic rain killing almost everyone else, the rest of them subsequently killing each other. Somehow these kids manage to get a time machine working, with three of them able to travel back 10 years to try and save the world.

<p>
The thing is, time travel or not, aging comes for us all, and these children do in fact grow older across those 10 years. While in the past, they can "investigate documents, technologies, and artefacts to understand history", all the while trying to make decisions that can lead you into several different futures. This, to put it plainly, is a concept that will likely continue to keep me up at night.
</p>
<p>
How much guilt should I feel for leading these children towards a future that might not even be liveable? Will I waste their years away in doing so? Do they get to have a future? These are questions I'm yet to answer myself through playing the game, but I'd like to, and it would be nice if you were interested in trying to do the same.
</p>
<p>
Developer Last Piscean worked on this solo after losing their job, and they still haven't managed to find one, and with the game releasing today (with a discount that makes it the price of two cups of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3272360/Decade/">Steam</a>), there's no better time to check it out than now.

I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a>, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">forum post</a>, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/colossalorder">Colossal Order</a> shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we’ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
This, they say, left them with "a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short." Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to "bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time." Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. 
</p>
<p>
I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like "a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad." Might be paraphrasing.
