  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In May this year, despite being deep in development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>, CD Projekt revealed that they'd be whipping out one more patch for The Witcher 3 in honour of its tenth birthday. Said update was originally set to drop in 2025, but has now been pushed back into 2026.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of an extra wait for cross-platform mod support, and given what the studio have been like witch Cyberpunk 2077's seemingly never-ending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">string of last updates</a>, I'm not ruling out them having secretly decided to add more new stuff to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> masterpiece while they're at it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026," the studio announced in a tweet. "We apologise for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>While the update's arguably bigger news for console players who'll be getting access to Witcher 3 mods for the first time, as we saw with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heed-the-dark-urge-and-check-out-baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-which-adds-13-new-evil-endings-plus-official-mod-tools">built-in mod support</a>, having another way for us PC folks to mod up our games is never a bad thing. As in that case, this official Witcher modding support will be done via Mod.io, which might be a preferable route for some, especially for relative modding newbies.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026.</p><p>We apologize for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release.… <a href="https://t.co/klXCkudiz1">pic.twitter.com/klXCkudiz1</a></p></div>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1971240482941362445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Obviously sticking to established modding setups will still be an option on PC. Odds are a lot of the most popular works will end up on both Mod.io and Nexus Mods, with more advanced mods likely remaining PC exclusive due to the added restrictions console modding entails. PC'll also remain the sole place you can fire up the REDkit tools CD Projekt released a little while ago to create mods.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the full FAQ CD Projekt released alongside their initial announcement of the update a read or re-read, you can find it <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">here</a>. Otherwise, here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fancy-snooping-around-the-witcher-3-palace-from-blood-and-wine-well-this-mod-gives-it-a-book-accurate-interior">cool Witcher 3 mod</a> you can play right now.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is news. You can bet your bottom it was news to me when I loaded up Nexus Mods for my daily look this morning and found that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s adult section had tripled in size overnight. It's the sexy Hornet mods, they've broken containment, truth-telling hips and all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until today, my searches for story-worthy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> mods had returned only the benign, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in">boss practice</a> add-ons that you could comfortably show an elderly relative. No more. Last night saw a pair of sexy Hornet mods, the first to hit the Nexus to my knowledge, arrive.</p>
<p>Shot first was '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/427">Curvier Hornet</a>' from modder Sandinsoda. "It was bound to happen," they wrote, pointing would-be sexy Skongers to requirements <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/142">Silksong Customizer</a>. As you'd imagine, the mod makes the capeless version of Hornet you play as at one point in metroidvania a bit more, er, voluptuous in terms of figure.
</p>
<p>Mere hours later, the chaser, a second mod. This time, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=description">Curvy naked hornet</a>' by modder foureye5. Sandinsoda marched straight into its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=posts">comments section</a>, bellicosely bellowing "I wonder what prompted this". Tension ensued for several hours, only to be broken by a third party, who replied: "Honestly it looks different enough to warrant it being a serious alternative. Like this one has better thighs. But yours has a better chest."</p>
<p>"Fair enough," responded Sandinsoda.</p>
<p>That's the torrid tale of why if you pull up <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong/mods?showAdultContent=true">Silksong's Nexus Mods page</a> right now and filter so that only ones tagged adult show up, you'll find three things. These two mods - the nude Hornet equivalent of Beavis and Butthead - and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/383">another mod</a> that adds a swear to the text prompt for binding.</p><p>Are these curvy Hornet mods the first ever sexy Silksong works ever created? Almost certainly not, since it has a <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/255454-hollow-knight-silksong-nude-mods/">Loverslab page</a> I refuse to verify my age in order to access, because I still have some shreds of dignity left. However, they are the first to emerge into what I'd deem the modding mainstream. Unrepentant. Insolent. Aimed a target audience of jokesters and probably at least one serious craver of Skong sexuality. Took them long enough, given they've even been preceded by a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/283">makes Hornet disappear altogether</a>.</p>
<p>What times in which we live.</p>

            <p>I don't massively feel the need for a new version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a>, even following EA's posh remake of the first, but if you've been dreaming of another visit to the game's sprawling interstellar necropolis, you could do worse than to check out the community-brewed Marker Patch. 
</p>
<p>Primarily created by Wemino, whose other projects include tune-ups for bullet-time shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>, it's a cure-all bundle of fixes for various issues with the game's PC release, including problems created by running it at higher frame-rates on heavier-duty 10 core PCs. Vemino has also increased the max number of genuinely dead Necromorphs that can be present in the environment, forced anisotropic filtering throughout, and added options to stop the game automatically connecting to online services that are no longer offered by EA.
</p><!--more-->
<p>You can find the Marker patch on <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/MarkerPatch">Github</a>. It's compatible with both the Steam release and the EA app version, with instructions for getting it working on Steam Deck or Linux. Here is a compressed/curated rundown of the contents I have produced by running my Plasma Cutter crudely over the Github page:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Stabilizes physics behavior at high framerates to eliminate the annoying flying corpses and limbs</li>
<li>Prevents the game from crashing on systems with more than 10 CPU cores </li>
<li>Corrects the VSync implementation to use the refresh rate selected in the game's settings instead of locking to 30 FPS </li>
<li>Fixes the tracking of Zealot and Hardcore difficulty completions to properly unlock rewards </li>
<li>Resolves item database conflicts where certain DLC suits incorrectly share IDs with other suits </li>
<li>Prevents crashes that can rarely occur when the game enumerates save files </li>
<li>Scales subtitle text appropriately for high resolutions</li>
<li>Implements proper raw mouse input to fix sensitivity issues </li>
<li>Blocks all DirectInput devices except mouse and keyboard to prevent unwanted camera spinning from devices like racing wheels, flight sticks, and other peripherals </li>
<li>Forces anisotropic texture filtering on all textures to improve clarity at oblique viewing angles </li>
<li>Forces proper trilinear filtering for smoother texture transitions between mipmap levels </li>
<li>Prevents connection attempts to EA servers at startup and prevents error messages from appearing </li>
<li>Increases the maximum number of bodies that can remain in the environment </li>
<li>Automatically sets the game to your screen resolution on first launch instead of defaulting to 1024×768 </li>
<li>Bypasses the EA/Visceral Games intro video on launch [when you enable this option]</li>
<li>Control which DLC items appear in the store </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The patch also does funky stuff with dinputto8 for mod compatibility. I say "funky stuff" because I don't know what a "dinputto8" is. It could be incredibly routine and entirely non-funky. For all I know, I'm basically saying "the patch does funky stuff with running on computers powered by electricity". Anyway, all the features can be customised individually. "The patch uses sensible defaults that work for most users, but allows fine-tuning of every aspect," writes Wemino.
</p><p>The odds of a full Dead Space 2 remake seem low at this stage. In April 2024, the rumour was mongered that EA had cancelled such a project in light of the original remake's sales. EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">have denied this</a>, and we've heard barely a squeak of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> since.

<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">Dead Space remake review</a> from January 2023, Liam Richardson (RPS in peace) summarised it as "luxuriously improved in small but considered ways". I myself enjoyed EA Motive's fancy reinterpretation of original developer Visceral's spacecraft setting, but found a lot of it to be adding widgets and sparkle for the sake of it. In particular, I found Isaac Clarke more compelling when he couldn't speak.

            <p>Earlier this month, fan-made revival project <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">The Crew Unlimited</a>, brought Ubisoft's decommissioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> back to life in server emulated PC form. Now, its devs have put out an update outlining a couple of things they're working on to try and take things to the next level.</p>
<p>This looks to be the first time the group have been able to catch their breath since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">releasing The Crew Unlimited</a> on September 15th, having had to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/freshly-released-the-crew-fan-revival-gets-early-fixes-devs-say-they-arent-responsible-for-issues-caused-by-game-files-from-shady-sources">work flat out on fixes for teething issues</a> in the immediate aftermath. Some of those problems stemmed from some players having acquired broken versions of The Crew's game files from "shady sources", with TCU's devs saying they aren't responsible for the server emulator not working in these cases.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/post-launch-next-139713544">'post-launch recap and what's next' post</a> The Crew Unlimited lead Whammy put up on the project's Patreon page late yesterday. "The reception has been quite overwhelming," they wrote to kick off. "We're extremely grateful for all the support we've received, it really means a lot to us. The amount of people who were eagerly awaiting the return of this decade old game really says a lot about how much this game means to people."</p>
<p>Getting down to brass tacks, Whammy wrote that the team's current focus is getting some more "important fixes" for their creation's launcher and server out of the door, with the former also set for an interface rework. In the long-term, there are two larger initiatives they've got in the works, with one being a beefy overhaul mod and the other being a revamp of the project's website that'll integrate it with the game's resurrected online multiplayer.</p><p>Starting with the mod, which the modders are collaborating with other Crew community members on, it's "a collection of essential and lore-friendly fixes, improvements and content restorations". The goal is to bring The Crew back "to a level of greatness it once had, while retaining all the new DLC content and features", as The Crew Unlimited's creators aren't fans of the "abysmal state" Ubisoft left the racer in once its last updates rolled out. The group seem to particularly dislike the effect <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mQRxyREr44vOVlZHRAgoG/the-crew-wild-run-is-out-now">2015's Wild Run update</a> had.</p>
<p>The second addition the works is dubbed "TCU Net 2.0", and will be a revamp of The Crew Unlimited's current website that'll introduce a system of online features linked to the project's in-game online experience. For instance, you'll be able access the likes of "user profiles, scores, friends, posts, [and] rewards". It sounds quite Rockstar Social Club-ish in principle at least, so it'll be interesting to see if the modders can pull it off.</p>
<p>"As you can see, we have quite ambitious goals," Whammy concluded. "But with enough time and your support, we believe we can achieve them." Given the achievement that just getting their server emulator up and running likely was, it's cool to see the team continue to aim high. The question remains as to whether The Crew Unlimited might face some lawyerly action from Ubisoft at some point, if the publisher believes it has a case, but all appears quiet on that front thus far.</p>
