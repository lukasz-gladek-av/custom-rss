            <p>
When was the last time you turned the radio on? I imagine for some of you younger readers, the answer is probably never. To be clear I'm not judging you here if that is the case, or even if it's just been a while, it's a format that feels hard to reckon with when its main point - listening to a range of pieces of music - is made borderline moot in the era of streaming services. All of which makes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/omega-point">Omega Point</a>, a game where you control a mech but the only thing you can do in it is change which radio station you're listening to, all the more interesting. <strong><em>A severe epilepsy warning is needed for this game as it has a lot of flashing images</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Omega Point is a new game from indie dev Cathroon, whose work you may have previously seen in <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/the-devil">The Devil</a>. A quick aside, if you haven't played The Devil, and you're desperate for a brutalist retro horror game, make sure you take a look at it alongside Omega Point. Speaking of, back to the point!
</p>
<p>
There is no protagonist in Omega Point, only you, the game starting with your body dissipating into nothingness, leaving you with no choice but to board your mech. This mech is the last surviving Doctrine, a machine that exists at "The Conjunction of Science and Religion." Once you're inside, you flick each individual switch to turn the metal giant on, eventually arriving at a timer and a message that says once it runs out, whoever is speaking will be here for you.
</p>
<p>
And after that? All you can do is explore a ruined world, and listen to the radio. There's rock tracks, chiptune, lo-fi beats, jungle, spoken word, looking at the credits there's at least upwards of 50 different songs to listen to.
</p><p>
With nothing else to do but listen to the radio, you do just that, and it makes this experience of watching the aforementioned timer count down feel a little bit less lonely. It's a curious little game that runs at just over 30 minutes (the timer itself is a full 30 minutes), so it's not a long experience, but it packs a lot to mull over in a short window.
</p>
<p>
There's that classic thing that many a mecha story does of what the pilot's relationship is to their mech in conjunction with feelings over the body. There's also the fact that even in such a desolate world, something as simple as the radio can still persist, each station sharing a small expression of itself for whoever happens upon it. A lot of big feelings for such a short run time!
</p>
<p>
A big recommendation from me for those in search of a short, punchy game that feels fitting for the times we live in. You can pick it up, for free I might add, on <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/omega-point">itch.io</a>.

Earlier this year, Bungie revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion that I can still only describe now as a head scratcher. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Renegades</a>, a Star Wars inspired expansion (quite literally as it's been made in collaboration with Lucasfilm) that was shown off properly for the first time in a livestream earlier today. Oh, and there's a release date for it too!
</p>
<p>
In terms of the meat and potatoes, actual Destiny portion of it, Renegades introduces the Lawless Frontier, a new co-op game mode that sees you taking on tough missions to build up reputation. Through this you can unlock new Renegade abilities like airstrikes, turrets, a bike. But like, a fancy sci-fi bike. There's also a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, which is directly inspired by Mos Eisley Cantina, which you can see pretty easily just by looking at it.

<p>
It's a weird thing to look at. There are some of the hallmarks of a "Star War" like that not-AT-ST-Walker. Some of the guns make that classic pew pew sound effect that's been etched into the minds of every person that's ever watched a Star Wars movie. Of course there's lightsabers too, mixed with Destiny enemies that sort of look like they could be from Star Wars but not so much that they feel horrendously awkward. It's like Bungie spritzed some perfume and waited too long before they walked into it - the scent is there, but it feels like it was a bit pointless.
</p><p>
I am eternally sceptical of live service games at the best of times, and with this, even as an outsider to Destiny 2, I'm just not sure it'll do what I presume Bungie hope it will. In any case, Destiny 2: Renegades is out December 2nd, so you've not got all that long to find out if it's any good or not.

            <p>
Keep your hands at 10 and 2, drivers, as Ironwood Studios has just offered up a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive's</a> first big expansion, Whispers in the Woods. Where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game has a sort of Stalker-but-you're-in-a-car kind of feel, this DLC looks like it's fully leaning into some horror vibes. The first half of the trailer has some real '70s era, found footage horror vibes, which feels laser targeted at my artistic proclivities.
</p>
<p>
It's sounding like a pretty meaty expansion too. According to the DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam page</a>, the full thing runs between 8-12 hours long, with the whole thing fully voiced, complete with new characters and "additional side narrative to discover." I'm quite fond of this ominous line describing the expansion's plot: "They have come to the Zone and left their mark. Travel into the whispering woods of the OEZ - a disturbing vision of the once familiar forests."

<p>
There's new maps and junction types to be found, some fresh parts and cosmetics to kit your car out with designed by this mysterious group, and of course more anomalies and anomaly behaviours. The big addition that's coming with Whispers in the Woods is a new gameplay system called Artifacts. These are mysterious objects that change and affect both you and the world itself, adding a bit of challenge while also being something you'll need to use to not be sent to the scrap heap in the sky.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's more garage stations, route modifiers, garage cosmetics, and a new lot of music from composer Wilbert Roget II - great name by the way.
</p>
<p>
No release date on the expansion, but it is slated to arrive before the end of the year. And the base game is 50% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">Steam</a>, so now seems like a great time to head out for a test drive.
