            <p>
It's another week, and with that comes word of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update. The patch isn't ready quite yet, but in a new <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/">update check-in</a> post, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/firaxis-games">Firaxis</a> shared that the game's next update is coming April 22nd, just a couple of weeks away. There's a few big changes coming too, so how about we just jump right in. First up is a change to resources. There'll be ten new resources coming to the game, all of which will get their own new narrative events for starters.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Resources will now crop up differently thanks to a "newly added randomized resource generation system." You'll still get key resources in every age, but past that there'll be a wider variety available on the map. Certain resources will also now only be findable on certain continents or hemispheres, with Firaxis hoping that this "gives your maps a little bit more personality and motivation to explore." Treasure resources will also be getting passive effects too.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the changes coming to food. A lot of Civvers (that's what I call Civilization players, I think it's gonna catch on) apparently found that rural population and food wasn't really worth investing in past a certain point, so Firaxis is making some tweaks to make population growth scale "much more smoothly across your campaign, even deep into later Ages. And, growing beyond 8 or 9 rural Population is now very achievable; doing so won’t take hundreds of turns."
</p>
<p>
This update introduces an endless play mode too, so you can keep going with your campaign once you've finished the modern age thanks to a new Just One More Turn option. There's a returning feature from previous Civ games too, Teams Multiplayer, and a bunch of other additions like a repair all option, less natural disasters, and overall quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
Firaxis also took the time to assure us all by promising that previously mentioned features like auto-explore and new map types are still in the works too, they just won't be in this update. In the meantime, just keep Civving (that's a new verb I just made for when you're playing Civilization, I think it's gonna catch on) it up!

            <p>
You know, I'm going to be very real with you right now: I thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-rumble">Sonic Rumble</a> was already out. It feels like I've been hearing about this thing for an eon now, probably because it was leaked a good while before Sega even officially revealed it. And yet here we are, with an announcement from the house of hog (sorry) saying that in actual fact, it's not out until May 8th, exactly a month from now! Perhaps this is a sign that I'm losing track of time, perhaps this is a game that Sega has been cooking in the kitchen for a bit too long. Who's to say!
</p>

<p>
This one's obviously a lot more geared towards kids that say to their parents "can you put Sonic on your phone" given that it'll be available on iOS and Android, but even though it does appear to be skipping out on a console release, it is coming to PC via Steam.

The skins-inclined amongst you - I appreciate this is the worst possible way to put this - might be interested to know that <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3Ddb045d06-e0f8-4d7d-8de3-69c167c330d2">the more wishlists there are</a>, the more goodies you get when the game arrives, like a movie Sonic skin, who honestly looks a bit terrifying.
</p>
<p>
I'm not easily won over by free-to-play games all that much, though I do think the kind of toy vibe Sonic Rumble has is cute. It looks like it's being quite smart about how it folds in that general Sonic feel to its more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque levels too. Seriously though, I like movie Sonic's design, but there's something not right about the Sonic Rumble skin…
