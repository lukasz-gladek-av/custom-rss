            <p>Sony remain confident that Bungie's live service shooter reboot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will launch within their current fiscal year - that is, before March 31st 2026 - and are fairly sure they'll be able to share an exact release date this autumn. They've factored it into their financial forecasts, see. </p>
<p>They're also pretty upbeat about their live service business at large, which accounted for around 40% of first-party software revenue in their last financial quarter, though they acknowledge that they screwed the pooch with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which got to exist in public for a whole couple of weeks before Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">kicked it into the sun</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes from the publisher's latest financial earnings call, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/">Vengeful Giraffe Computing</a>. "First, about Marathon, how we factored it in the forecast, we expect the launch to happen within the fiscal year," Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao commented through an interpreter, when pressed about the game's release date by an investor. "But, having said that, this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet."</p>
<p>She added: "We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation."</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of on-going restructuring at Bungie, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people last summer</a> and transferred others to a new studio within Sony. Bungie used to be a "very independent environment" when Sony acquired them in 2022, Tao observed, but "this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding." Slight undertones here of the Emperor in Star Wars commenting that the deflector shield will be quite operational, when your friends arrive.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper WSTE-M5 Combat Shotgun were moderately enthused about Bungie's recent closed Marathon alpha, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">in terms of the art direction at least</a>. But then came news that it had made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">unapproved usage of somebody else's art</a>, and then came an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a>. </p>
<p>In the earnings call, Tao assured that this is unlikely to be another Concord situation. "We are now fixing the problems, so we believe this launch will happen," she told an investor. "If this launch is cancelled we'd need to do the revision of the valuation, however as of now this is not expected."</p>
<p>As for Sony's transition toward live service gaming, she acknowledged that there have been missteps, but pointed out that "if we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB The Show and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner."</p>
<p>The aforesaid 40% proportion of Sony's revenue represents Sony's most recent financial quarter. Tao conceded that "for the full year it's a little less, probably between 20-30%. So in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there's definitely been a change." Tao did not discuss the reported recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">cancellation of two live service games from Sony Bend and Bluepoint</a>, the latter rumoured to have been working on a new God Of War.</p>
<p>My highly original, sage and hilarious closing thought is that Sony could have just told investors that "it's a Marathon, not a sprint", then surprise-released some kind of playable teaser called Sprint. What kind of game could Sprint have been? Unfortunately, I have now run out of originality, sagacity and hilarity, so must turn the completion of this sketch over to the comments.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> won't be exactly the same game, despite their obvious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">bullet casing-littered common ground</a>. However, they are opting to mirror each other in one manner - both will require you to enable secure booting on your PC.</p>
<p>As if summoned to do so by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">EA letting everyone know</a> that this week's BF6 open beta would necessitate a delve in your BIOS to click yes on a thing in the name of eliminating cheating, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">have revealed</a> Blops is doing the same thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>'s season five today, August 7, EA are initiating a "phased rollout" of secure booting and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 as mandatory requirements when hopping into an entry of the series. The goal is to stop folks from loading any files not flagged as 'safe' when they fire up their PCs, such as ones they might use to do the likes of aimbotting or wallhacking.</p>
<p>The switch isn't happening overnight, with this Black Ops 6 season still letting you jump in if you've not enabled one or both features, but you will be served notifications telling you to sort your setup out for the future in that case. Then, when Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">prone-crawls its way out of the gulag</a> later this year, it'll be mandatory to have both enabled to play.</p>
<p>"These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and weâ€™re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision wrote. They also provided <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot">instructions</a> as to how to check whether you've got secure boot and TPM 2.0 enabled via your BIOS settings, and turn them on if not.</p>
<p>If your game-playing box's specs are fairly up-to-date, and especially if you're running Windows 10 or 11, it shouldn't be too much of a faff to sort. That's provided you're open to taking these extra steps with your own hardware as part of publishers' efforts to try and combat cheating by, in Activision's words, enacting measures to "strengthen security and protect the experience, without impacting performance."</p>
<p>As of right now, the company don't have any immediate plans to make secure booting and TMP 2.0 mandatory for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>, but they indicate that could change in future. They also wrote that they'll "share more details on additional protection measures weâ€™ll be putting in place for Call of Duty as we get closer to the Black Ops 7 launch", and that enabling two-factor authentication on your Activision account might become mandatory down the road.</p>
<p>If it helps, maybe imagine it's Captain Price ordering you to do all of this admin just to shoot some folks dressed in swanky tactical getups. Also, if you've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">sitting in a Battlefield 6 beta queue all morning</a>, some server messing about by EA should hopefully help you get in soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new joint investigation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">Guardian</a>, Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/">+972 Magazine</a>, and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/">Local Call</a> has claimed that Microsoft have worked with the Israeli military to store surveillance data on Palestinian civilians in Azure servers overseas, with some of that data allegedly being used to research and identify bombing targets. The report has led to renewed calls for game developers and players to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">the recently launched Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign</a> against Microsoft and Xbox gaming products and services - in particular, Minecraft, Call Of Duty, Candy Crush, and Game Pass. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report is based on interviews with 11 sources from Microsoft and the Israeli military, plus access to a cache of leaked Microsoft documents. In late 2021, the Guardian piece begins, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with Yossi Sariel, the commander of Israel's military surveillance agency Unit 8200, to discuss plans for storing intelligence data on Microsoft cloud servers. According to the report's sources, the inspiration for these proposals was that Israel's military did not have the storage space or computing power to handle the amount of data they wanted to collect and process.
</p>
<p>The alleged result of that conversation was a cloud-based system that became operational in 2022, and has been used to gather "indiscriminate" recordings of Palestinian phone calls in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the report, as of July this year around 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data were being held in Microsoft Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion were stored in Ireland, though not all of this data may be from Unit 8200.
</p>
<p>"Thanks to the control it exerts over Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure, Israel has long intercepted phone calls in the occupied territories," the report notes. "But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians." One of the investigation's sources also explains how these phone recordings may have been used to plan airstrikes, commenting that intelligence officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the vicinity of an individual target.</p>
<p>Sariel ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings">resigned his position in September 2024</a> in response to criticism for failing to anticipate the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Israeli civilians in October 2023, which left over a thousand dead with hundreds taken hostage. According to this week's Guardian report, he was accused of prioritising fancy new technology over older surveillance methods.</p>
<p>But the cloud-based system he allegedly developed with Microsoft's assistance is said to remain in use alongside AI-driven target recommendation tools, as the Israeli military continues a punitive and open-ended assault on Gaza that has killed over 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, and left hundreds of thousands more homeless and starving.</p>
<p>The report argues that Microsoft had some awareness during development of the system that it was being used to collect phone calls and facilitate airstrikes. It cites internal records that show that during the initial 2021 meeting with Nadella, Sariel referred only to "sensitive workloads" of secret data, not the storage of Palestinian phone calls. But it adds that "documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files" and that Israel-based Microsoft staff, who allegedly include former members of Unit 8200, appear to have known about the project's overall objectives. </p>
<p>The report also references files that show that Microsoft executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue from the project, calling it "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">confirmed that they had supplied technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. But they insisted that they had found "no evidence" that it was being used to target or harm Palestinians, citing an external review carried out by an unnamed third party.</p>
<p>They have also pushed back on this week's claims, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the Guardian that they have "no information" on the data being stored in the cloud by Unit 8200. "At no time during this engagement," the spokesperson added, "has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<p>Asked about Nadella and Sariel's relationship, the spokesperson continued that the CEO "attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting" and there was "no discussion" of the exact content of the "sensitive workloads" above.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Microsoft's comments, this week's news has fuelled calls to join the BDS boycott, with some participants pointing out that this doesn't have to mean parting ways entirely with any and all Microsoft services. "BDS has a standing boycott target on Microsoft products which people can realistically drop from their lives, understanding that not everyone can change their operating system," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a> lead artist and gameplay designer Allison Shabet in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rally.luckyraven.cc/post/3lvr42n2vm22i">a Bluesky post yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3lvr4m3lhi222">Bluesky thread</a>, game designer and writer Austin Walker added that "I've obviously been saying this a lot lately, but BDS does not expect anyone to drop everything made by Microsoft all at once. They pick very specific targets in order to get as wide a coalition as possible, and in the case of Xbox, even suggest different tiers of engagement."
