            <p>We last wrote about immersive sim sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 3 in 2020, when developers Otherside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-take-over-system-shock-3">handed the project over to megapublisher Tencent</a>. At the time, Otherside commented that "as a smaller indie studio, it had been challenging for us to carry the project on our own."</p>
<p>Now, Nightdive Studios - who own the overall rights to System Shock, and have already remade the first game - have popped up with news that the System Shock 3 project endures, in some form. We could get clarification about its status “potentially within a year”. Don’t call it a comeback, do call it a sign of life.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated,” Nightdive’s director of business development Larry Kuperman hedged at GDC this week, in comments published by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">VGC</a>. </p>
<p>Can we expect a proper update anytime soon? “Not as yet, not as yet,” Kuperman went on. “I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year. It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>,” he added. “I’ve been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake, and I said, ‘are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won’t be able to do a remake in the future?’ That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there’s going to be content coming out.”</p>
<p>So there’s your bonus headline here: Nightdive might do a System Shock 2 remake after their upcoming remaster, which will launch in June. Asked about the future of the series beyond retreads of the existing games, Kuperman said: “We’ll see what happens. I mean, there’s stuff that we can do within the first and the second.” Some expansions then?</p>
<p>It’s all very… non-enlightening. But I’m happy with any sign that System Shock has a future beyond replaying the hits, and Nightdive seem like they could hack a threequel. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of their System Shock remake</a>, Jeremy Peel called it “a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design.”</p>
<p>Jeremy’s also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-system-shock-2-made-stephen-kick-and-nightdive-studios">an interview with Nightdive</a> detailing how the studio scooped up the license, beginning with a phone chat with an insurance company and ending with Nightdive’s acquisition by Atari.</p>
<p>As for Otherside – the studio co-founded by original System Shock devs Paul Neurath and Warren Spector - they’re currently working on a new immersive sim, Thick As Thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
