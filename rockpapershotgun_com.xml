            <p>The regular modpocalypses which tend to erupt when a fresh update for a game comes down the pipeline - an especially terrifying prospect if it's an older game and the tweaks/additions aren't something you're happy to temporarily switch back to vanilladom in order to enjoy - may now be less of a ballache. Well, at least when it comes to the Steam Workshop, which has just had new version control pipes welded to its pulsating metal frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Building on the features they already has in terms of letting developers offer older versions of games as optional branches if they wish, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497183817277113901?utm_source=SteamDB">have announced</a> the release of some new Steam APIs and Workshop item options designed to "make it easier for developers and mod authors to work together in ensuring compatibility of mods as games evolve". Basically, devs are able to "better define" previous game versions , while modders can upload different versions of their mods which are compatible with those game versions and make clear what should work with what.</p>
<p>It's a process we've seen be necessary on a larger scale with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-modders-still-have-no-plans-to-port-it-to-next-gen-fallout-4-unless-a-console-version-becomes-possible">only available in a form</a> which works with a specific pre next-gen update version of that game. In this case, it should be easier to keep the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> working with your regular load order if you've delved into the workshop and downloaded 25 million custom livery mods for your favourite MAN lorry which are suddenly out of date. Though, obviously that still depends on developers and modders having gone in and made use of these new tools for their works.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/itemversioning">full documention</a>, devs will be able use Steam's API to detect which version of the game a player's using, which mods they have installed, and put up an interface splash asking the player if they'd like to switch to the right game version if necessary. That sounds like it could make troubleshooting much more of a doddle, with an extra step even suggesting Steam can subsequently be prompted to close the game, switch branches and relaunch the game once the right version's installed. As for a more in-depth picture of what you'll see when checking out which mods work with different versions, the following passage from the guidance for modders sheds a bit more light on how they might use the tools:</p>
<blockquote>We know that many mod authors will not have the time to check whether their mod supports the latest version of a game. So we built this system to support ranges that include or exclude future updates. If the mod item is generally a simple item and likely to work with new versions of the game, then it may make sense to leave the supported range open-ended. However, if the mod is complex and the mod author wishes to test their mod with new game versions before declaring support, that can be easily done when configuring the supported ranges.</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how it plays out in practice, but anything that might help keep us all from the scourge of corrupted or unusable saves with thousands of hours put into them is welcome news.</p>

            <p>Following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">parliamentary debate</a> of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government last year, a group of Green Party members have announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would "compel" its MPs to support the campaign.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you need a refresher, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing for action from governments and lawmakers against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>. The campaigners argue that publishers should be required to put in place an end of life plan for titles whoe servers are shut down, ensuring players aren't locked out of always-online titles immediately at that point, instead being able to keep playing in some form - generally offline or via fan-maintained online servers. The other side of the coin argues that this entails a not unsubstantial cost and burden to put on studios or publishers.</p>
<p>There weren't any Green Party MPs present at the Stop Killing Games petition's parliamentary debate, something that arguably isn't too surprising given the left-wing party only has four MPs at current - for context, the ruling Labour Party currently have 404 and their main opposition the Conservatives have 119. Now, party member Morton Atkins, chairperson and coordinator of the party's branch for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire has announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would push the Greens towards being vocal advocates for what Stop Killing Games propose.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m campaigning to change this. In collaboration with a dozen plus <a href="https://twitter.com/GreensOrganise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GreensOrganise</a> and Green Party of England and Wales members we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign.</p>— Mo 🏳️‍🌈💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩 (@Mo_Atkins_Green) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Atkins_Green/status/2008944073218854960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"In collaboration with a dozen plus Greens Organise and Green Party of England and Wales members, we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign," Atkins announced in a thread on the Tweeter. Revealing that he signed the Stop Killing Games petition which parliament debated, he added the following:</p>
<blockquote>The Green Party of England and Wales aims to be the party for a sustainable society and the party for gamers. If this passes it will help reduce destruction of digital art which has considerable environmental impacts during its creation, keeping that art alive through community volunteers and engagement with them via 'end of life plans' for all games, preserving our online third spaces which are crucial for tackling isolation and loneliness especially among our youth and the neurodivergent community who live parts of their social lives in these spaces.</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that the group of party members Atkins cites as supporting the proposed amendment thus far is a relatively small one and doesn't appear to include any of the party's four MPs at this point. I've reached out to the Green Party to ask whether any of those MPs plan to support the proposed amendment or wish to express views on it. Atkins suggested that the amendment will be put to a vote at <a href="https://springconf2026.greenparty.org.uk/login?backUrl=%2F">the party's 2026 Spring Conference</a>.</p>

            <p>The self-explanatory <a href="https://gabemcarvalho.itch.io/dont-stare">Don’t Stare</a> is both a gamejam creation I enjoy for itself and also, an idea I’d love to be incorporated into any number of first-person RPGs. Here is how the latter possibility might work: you are bandying insults with the Demon King ahead of the final battle. You’ve got some solid bantz going, but there’s a note of awkwardness, for the Demon King has very large, protruding ears, and you can’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Such biteable tubercles! Such luscious lobes! The more you stare, the more agitated the Demon King becomes, till at last, he flees in tears before you’ve exchanged a single blow. And that, young Chosen One, is how we first defeated evil many decades ago. I understand the Demon King has had some plastic surgery since.</p><!--more-->
<p>There could actually be a Demon King in Don’t Stare, for all I know. It’s a speed-dating sim with 67 fantastical characters. Your own character doesn’t want to be here – they’ve been signed up for the event by an interfering friend. As such, your goal isn’t to romance anybody but to scare them all away by moving your eye cursor over parts of their anatomy they’re sensitive about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s as obvious as a literal hole in somebody’s head. Sometimes it takes a bit more calculation. You’ve only got 20 seconds before the bouncer throws you out, mind, so peel those peepers.</p>
<p>NPCs in videogames seldom object to being stared at - an expression of the player’s power that could always do with more analysis, versus the more obvious intrusive agency afforded by, say, guns and traversal abilities. Think about how you keep your eyes to yourself while walking down a city street, and compare how you swing the camera about without a care while playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p>Some exceptions to the rule: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, there are creatures that respond (very unpleasantly) to being looked at. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, Norman Reedus will sock you one if you look at his crotch while visiting the "Private Room" (compare and contrast "press L1 to gawp at cleavage" in MGS3).</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that Amnesia games also constrain your gaze, because looking at awful stuff will drive your character nuts. And perhaps you could make connections with a game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3595450/Object_Impermanence/">Object Impermanence</a>, in which parts of the world are only present when you're looking at them. Any other weird eye mechanics to discuss?</p>
