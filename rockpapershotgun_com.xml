            <p>It was the 20-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> at the weekend, which saw the shooter's modern counterparts celebrating with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-2s-lost-e3-2003-demo-will-finally-be-playable-thanks-to-modder-magic">classic multiplayer maps and long-lost levels</a>. But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel's development back in 2004. Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-2-bungie-development-1235157887/">interviewed two key designers</a> of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Halo and its sequel had a smaller development team than an equivalent blockbuster today might have. This meant some designers would have to do odd jobs outside of their wheelhouse. This is what led Lorraine and Robert McLees, a husband and wife who worked at Bungie during Halo 2's development, to create various things for the game beyond the requirements of their job description. </p>
<p>Although Robert was a weapons designer, for instance, he was also made responsible for coming up with concept art for the Flood. And he particularly remembers creating the infection form of the creature (the little creepy bug-bois that burst and infect their victims with spores).</p>
<p>The first concept "looked like a cross between a house centipede and a blood sausage," he told Rolling Stone. "That was disgusting, but didn’t look very mobile." </p>

<p>Unhappy with the first pass, the artist discovered the perfect shape for the alien creature in time for another attempt. And it turned out to be an image that had been "skittering around in the shadowy parts of my brain" since childhood.</p><p>“When my daughter was born, I gathered up all those Golden Key books I remembered from my own childhood so I could read to her before she went to sleep at night. And there it was, in <a href="https://littlegoldenbooks.fandom.com/wiki/The_Saggy_Baggy_Elephant">The Saggy Baggy Elephant</a>, a palm tree launched into the air by dancing elephants — the weird shape that had been haunting my subconscious mind for thirty-odd years. That was the basis for the Flood Infection Form.”</p>
<p>You can see the exact palm tree he mentions in <a href="https://youtu.be/LrxiNYuqcKI?feature=shared&amp;t=16">this YouTube reading of the book</a>. And sure enough, the tree's roots do evoke the unmistakable tendril legs of a Flood critter. The trunk also looks a lot like that ugly conical appendage that crowns the alien larva's head. So I guess we all need to thank children's illustrator Gustaf Tenggren for inspiring a horrifying monster. Neat.</p>
<p>The interview is interesting reading if you're a Halo head. The two designers talk openly about how crunch at the studio affected their life, even as they dealt with a newborn baby. Lorraine, who was responsible for the game's cover art, was also the person who designed the Pillar Of Autumn, the human spaceship from the first Halo. That's cool. If I am ever asked to imagine "human military spaceship", to this day I would instantly summon that vessel to mind.</p>

<p>A lot of the crunch suffered by Bungie devs is well-documented already. One engineer at the studio said the brutal environment <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungies-13-year-battle-to-kill-crunch-culture">"almost killed Bungie as a company."</a> Another lead engineer, Chris Butcher, once told our sister site Eurogamer that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-recalls-brutal-halo-2-crunch">worked seven day weeks</a> for months on end. Or as he put it:</p>
<blockquote>"The crunch on Halo 2 was, 'Oh my god, we're f***ed. We're all going to die.' Months and months of that emotional, negative tone was really hard to deal with - but at the same time, we did a lot of awesome work."</blockquote>
<p>The Rolling Stone interview basically confirms a lot of that history. </p>
<p>"Bungie, up to then, never had good managers,” said Robert McLees. “They had creatives that were forced into managerial roles while still remaining in their creative roles — basically working two jobs. This kinda worked when there were 12 of us. It worked less well when there were 30 of us. It collapsed when there were 60 of us.”</p>
<p>"At the time, we really didn’t know what was going to happen," added Lorraine. "If we were going to make it or not. It was the make-it-or-break-it period for the young Bungie crew. So much burn-out.”</p>
<p>Crunch continues to be a problem for game developers today. The management of the studio working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">imposed a mandatory seven-day week on its employees</a>, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> workers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-developers-allege-mismanagement-crunch-and-disturbing-creative-decisions-in-new-report">also complained about unsustainable work demands</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-100">RPS 100</a> is our list of the best games to play on PC. It encompasses the full breadth and width of PC gaming stretching back to 1873, but focuses solely on those games that remain great to play today. It's updated yearly by our crack team of writers, and the first half of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">2024 edition is live now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You might note that the format has changed this year. Instead of a long article to scroll through, the list is presented as a sortable, filterable list of game covers, and you can click on each cover to read the RPS team's  evangelism for that game. We hope that it's a pleasant browsing experience.
</p>
<p>Favouring games that are great to play today means that we've paid no mind to importance or influence, but it doesn't mean we've ignored older games, and you'll find plenty of older classics on the list. We've also made a conscious effort to encapsulate the diversity of experiences available on PC. For a start, that means that all games playable on PC are PC games, no matter where they were first released or what extra peripherals (such as VR headsets) they may require. It also means we've made difficult choices and not simply filled the list with excellent-but-similar sequels from beloved series, except in instances where those games feel significantly different from one another.
</p>
<p>You might, as you browse our selection, wonder when you'll reach the bar charts, diagrams and decimal points which explain the cold mathematical logic of our selections. These things are not present in our list. The RPS100 is a work of human beings, for human beings, and as such has been constructed using the twin blades of subjectivity and taste. We think we have pretty great taste and the expertise to explain ourselves, so if you would like to know how wet a game is, how fungible or how zealous, we have explained our opinions under each game when relevant.</p><p>The second half of the list will go live at noon tomorrow. Don't see your favourite game on there when the list is done? There are too many great PC games for us to include them all, but there are comments below the list where you can share your own great taste and bask in the evangelism of your fellow readers. 
</p>
<p>Go, read, and whether you agree with us or not, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">hope you enjoy this year's RPS 100</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
