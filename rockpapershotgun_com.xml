            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> developers Don't Nod have revealed that they're working on a new narrative game based around a "major IP" in partnership with Netflix. The game'll be developed at Don't Nod's Montreal studio, with the chilling-based streaming service set to publish it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This deal was announced via Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">latest financial results</a>, which detail how they've done in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. CEO Oskar Guilbert characterised the first six months of this year as having seen "solid revenue growth", though the company's total operating revenue of â‚¬13.9 million was down by 5% compared to the first half of 2024. A "performance plan" they've enacted after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs">a rough period</a> - which saw staff laid off, games put on pause, and Guilbert himself accused of "catastrophic management" by the French union STJV - is expected to start paying larger dividends soon.</p>
<p>This deal with Netflix is cited as a "key milestone" in that effort to turn things around. "The project finances the Montreal studio and aligns with the Group's strategy to secure its resources and strengthen its ability to evolve in an increasingly competitive and selective market," Don't Nod say in addition to blowing their own storytelling trumpet.</p>
<p>There's no indication of which Netflix show might be getting the game treatment, but the socials have very much begun to fill with 'Life is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>' jokes. Personally, I think it'll be an adaptation of Victoria Beckham's fashion documentary which also rewinds back Lost Records-style to her and David's heyday in the 90s and early 2000s. Either that or something about a serial killer. Or maybe Wednesday Addams is going to make a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543830/The_Addams_Family_Mansion_Mayhem/">less party-centric</a> return to the gamisphere.</p>
<p>Until we find out, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-bloom-review%3EGraham's%20review">Graham's review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>'s first tape a re-read. It made him ask important questions:</p>
<blockquote>Is it possible that this video game of Young Adult tropes and teenage girl protagonists just isn't meant for me? I have a few rebuttals to that idea. For one, hey, this game also contains the tired 40-something version of those characters, which I obviously find deeply relatable. I was also a kid in the '90s and feel a growing nostalgia for Hey Arnold! and my Nintendo 64. I bet I'd love Yellowjackets, and I own a Rainbow Rowell novel and one day I might even read it, but really I just think that good writing can transcend demographics.</blockquote>
<p>You'll always be a young adult to me, former bossman.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> has seen its last content update, with Amazon Games confirming their development of the MMO is winding down. The game's servers will be staying online in the short term. This news follows mass layoffs at Amazon, with over 14,000 roles reportedly being affected across the company and the gaming division seeing "significant" cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These layoffs were initially reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">Bloomberg</a>. Amazon haven't confirmed exactly how many staff in its video game arm have been affected by the layoffs, though New World developers Amazon Games Orange County have seen "significant" cuts.</p>
<p>What has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">been made 100% clear</a> by Amazon vice president of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom is that these layoffs are seeing the company move away from heavy investment into MMOs, with recently re-launched cloud service Amazon Luna being doubled down on. The company will plough on with some of the other games it's got in the works or is publishing, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">a new Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics</a>, strategy game March of the Giants, and an unannounced racer from Maverick Games.</p>
<p>That brings us to New World and a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">news post</a> published by Amazon Games late yesterday. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," it reads. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles."</p><p>While it won't be getting any more additions alongside essential bug fixes, the MMO won't disappear overnight. Amazon Games plan to keep its servers running "through 2026" and say they'll provide at least six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable. In the meantime, New World's Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are being dished out for free on PC. You can also still buy and use in-game currency like Marks of Fortune for the moment, but no refunds'll be offered on any you've already bought.</p>
<p>"Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey," the post concludes. "We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by Amazon's mass layoffs.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> arrives in full today, October 29th. Ahead of the gates to Arcadia finally being flung open to those who didn't fancy paying extra for early access, Obsidian have taken a stab at fixing some key issues and pesky bugs which've reared their heads so far. Good news, unless your roleplaying was set to be contingent upon being swallowed up by the ground or having to try and beat up an angry cupboard at some point in the space adventure.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a look through the notes of <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-hotfix-1040">hotfix 1.0.4.0</a>, I've spotted a couple of minor hiccups I ran into during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review playthrough</a>, these being Aza the culty companion regularly indicating a need to chat when there was no fresh convo to be had and Golden Ridge's Monastery sometimes being a bit confusing to navigate despite the objective markers' best efforts.</p>
<p>Some more critical bugs swatted include a "permanent fade to black" which could seemingly see the game unintentionally declare 'that's all folks' when you returned to a certain landing pad, the acidic body dematerializer stopping you from equipping weapons if you saved while using it, and companion Inez sometimes being tough to find after her first encounter. Obsidian say they've also "improved the accuracy of information displayed during the end-of-game slides".</p>
<p>Beyond those, there are plenty of more generic bugs you might get early in a game's lifespan, such as certain actions leading the player to fall through the world, quests not progressing, placeholder text popping up, and some collision misbehaviour. Amusingly, the studio add that "the game will no longer crash when interrupting certain NPC bark dialogue lines by interacting with or killing one of the participating speakers" and that you'll no longer run into in issue which would lead you to be be stuck in perma-combat because an enemy was trapped in a closet.</p><p>Finally, I've reached out to Obsidian for clarification regarding the very first bug the post lists. You see, it says PS5 players have run into issues with premium edition gear not being handed out properly, and underneath there's a note which reads as follows: "Unfortunately, the Consumerism Flaw being rewarded is not fixed in this patch and will be addressed in a future hotfix". Since I'm not 100% sure at a glance whether that's PS5 specific like the gear issues, I've opted to double check in case my running into that flaw when I did on PC was related to some bugginess, rather than the gag myself and others have since assumed it to be.</p>
<p>If word comes through that it's just a bug after all, I'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/so-it-turns-out-the-outer-worlds-2-spent-95-of-its-runtime-mocking-me-for-a-purchase-i-didnt-make">update this piece</a> and don the Moon Man helmet of shame.</p>
<p>If you're hopping into The Outer Worlds 2 today, consider checking out our handy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-beginners-guide">beginner's guide</a> if you fancy some handy tips to help you get up to speed. Also, here's a rundown of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-modders-have-already-unleashed-all-of-the-words-and-delivered-a-boon-to-cowards">some early mods</a> you might fancy grabbing.</p>
