<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWa0dZMHYeE&amp;ab_channel=asphnxma">It is happening again</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting another huge update filled with all sorts of new things to do, and because there's so much, we'll just jump straight into it. First of all, the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game just lets you become a mayor of a town now. Or, I guess an Overseer as described in the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/">patch notes</a> (it says mayor in the trailer), a role that lets you look after four settlements by governing their inhabitants and investing in their infrastructure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Settlement management has had a revamp, with every building within town now featuring its own "calculated contribution to the happiness, population and productivity of the settlement." Settlers have unique information pages with tidbits about their strengths, weaknesses, skills, and even personalities, and citizen disputes have had a big rework too, getting rid of any ambiguity, and adding in a lot more resolutions.

<p>
You'll be able to come across Autophage settlements, inhabited by robotic lifeforms that like to keep their secrets. "Travellers who have encountered the Autophage can join these settlements as Overseer, and those who have earned their trust may receive a special invitationâ€¦"
</p>
<p>
If you've recruited any pilots to your squadron, they can now defend against pirate raids, settlements can now feature fishing ponds, you can customise your own player voice, and you may also need to protect your settlement from the "vile insect queen and her brood." This isn't even all of it, there's a huge swathe of features being added like the full release of cross-save compatibility, more resource production opens for debt-free settlements, the list just goes on and on, so I'll let you dig into the nitty gritty for yourself.
</p>
<p>
This update, which is somehow free, is available to check out now.
