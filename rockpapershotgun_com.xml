            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s game director Carrie Patel has been on the blower to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains">Eurogamer</a> about why Avowed doesn't have any romance in it, which is to say it does, actually, if you're paying attention, and also, affairs of the heart aren't supposed to feel like min-maxing your Wizard, Kevin. To put that another way, she has gently suggested that relationships are more relatable when they aren't some kind of mechanic or system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she told Eurogamer's Robert Purchese (HELLO BERTIE). </p>
<p>As Purchese adds, Avowed does actually harbour the possibility of a soulmate, but this isn't served up to you Commander Shepard-style on a bed of amorous tooltips. It'll happen if you get to know the person in question and decide that you like them.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them," Patel explained. "But if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>
<p>I'm still playing through Avowed, and have no idea who this is referring to, so you'll have to do your own homework, you scamps. Also, I tend not to romance people in RPGs because I am afraid of emotions, and also because look Morrigan, we are trying to save the world here, there'll be time to knock boots after the credits roll. Ah, many are the sparks I have allowed to fizzle out. Sometimes the horny design gets the better of me, admittedly. I was appalled to learn at the end of the original Dragon's Dogma that I'd been seducing the local blacksmith all along. </p>
