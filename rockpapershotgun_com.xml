One of the internet's primordial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art">New Media</a> experiences is the Wiki Game - an asymmetrical "racing sim" in which you hurry from one Wikipedia page to another by clicking on the fewest number of links. Try doing that in the Museum of All Things, "a nearly-infinite virtual museum generated from Wikipedia", which you can <a href="https://mayeclair.itch.io/museum-of-all-things">download for free from Itch</a>. Devised by <a href="https://may.as/">Maya Claire</a> using the Godot Engine with audio from Neomoon's Willow Wolf, it's either a charmingly unusual way to browse a wonderful public resource or a free-associative liminal death-spiral, depending on your mood going in.
</p>
<p>
The Museum pulls down and generates new exhibition spaces from individual Wikipedia pages as you explore. Its scale is limited only by the quantity of cache memory you assign it in the settings. Needless to say, you'll need to be online for it to work. There's no attempt to disguise the procgen: instead, the simulation makes an insidiously graceful spectacle of its own self-assembly. Marble displays, neatly captioned imagery and overhead light fittings slide and rattle into view as you enter rooms (again, you can decide the proximity at which they appear in the settings). Instead of hyperlinks, there are little signs with arrows pointing you down a tunnel to a relevant exhibit.
</p>
<p>
If the Museum Of All Things is a celebration of Wikipedia, with the option of jumping out from the pause menu to visit the relevant page in a browser, the glamour of its generation quickly takes priority over the act of retrieving information. The air-con serenades you steadily as you venture down one staircase after another, pursuing a layout that is unapologetically non-Euclidean, with entire schools of thought and the wisdom of bygone ages tucked Tardis-like inside blocks a few metres wide. 
</p>
<p>
This space is vast beyond comprehension, and yet, terribly small, for each room's architecture is the same collection of assets, elegantly rearranged. The polished wooden floors reflect the exhibits but you can't see yourself in them. A distorted background tone intrudes upon the hum of the air-con - is that a tannoy announcement? Somebody singing? Oh hell, I have to get out. I tumble down the corridor to "Butter Tea", hurry on through into "List of Butter Dishes", then "Dish (food)", then "Eat", then "Chewing", then "Teeth". I pause before a diagram of a rat's incisor and I know that the rat is me. The Museum has me now. Please, come find me.

"There are too many games," is a phrase often heard from people who wish to rustle the jimmies of leftists who contend that overabundance and scarcity are market constructs. It's not something you'll hear from me, but I do think there are quite a lot of <em>one</em> type of game, a game that spawns incessantly within the corrupted magic circle of my inbox, as though I were playing out a scripted last stand against insurmountable odds. That game is the roguelike deckbuilder. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Once upon a time, I thought "roguelike deckbuilder" had a certain robust poetry to it. Now, the syllables strike my ears like the banging of icebergs against a foundering hull. Each new arrival harrows with the thought of a hundred deaths, a hundred unlocks, a hundred fresh descents, all of it spiked with this season's flavour of supporting fiction or subgenre - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phnUHcP6oXk">what's for tea, Mother? Soulslikes on toast?</a></p>
<p>I do still enjoy these games, especially the ones that genuinely have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cobalt-core-review">some kind of imaginative twist</a>, and I mean no offence to their creators, but I've run out of ways to distinguish them using the puny English language. So I'm glad that Rogue Light Deck Builder is here to hold up a mirror to my aggravation.

In Rogue Light Deck Builder, you hammer together a wooden balcony in the flickering glow of a dodgy bulb. A joke like that probably doesn't need a whole game to deliver it, but the Steam demo amused me regardless. Here's how it works: you line up a nail with your floating hand cursor, and smash it in by yanking your mouse around as though trying to free it from the mouth of a resentful dog. The hammer connects with a rubbery animal squeak. It vaguely sounds as though you're crucifying Pikachu. 
</p>
<p>
In a nice send-up of Borderlandsy RPGs with their geysers of damage numerals, words such as "perfect" and "OK" flop out on impact and settle squidgily on the boards like condemned sausages, to be absently brushed around as you thwack in nails. There are also bugs you can splat, and special nails with clover stems that (I think) bestow bonus earnings. Much of the time, of course, you'll clobber your own hand, which deducts an "Ouch" from the invoice emerging from a printing calculator in top left.
</p>
<p>
You are doing all this at the behest of your "husband", a molten <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> cadaver seated behind a marble desk. He has upgrades to sell, including more resilient hands, more accurate hammers, and slightly less dodgy bulbs. Each time you exit the store the deck needs to be built again. Beyond it sways a suffocating horizon of cyanotype foliage. The priciest unlock is a key that costs one million dollars and is labelled "escape".
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3149370/ROGUE_LIGHT_DECK_BUILDER/">Try it for yourself here.</a> The full game is out 17th March. Sorry for moaning about roguelike deckbuilders, developers! It's partly that I seldom have time to dig into each one and work out what sets it apart. When all you have is the hammer of overwhelm, everything starts to look like the nail of diminishing returns.

            <p>The requirements for your PC to feast on the treefrogs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </a>tactical espionage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> have been revealed. The minimum specs ask for a RTX 2060 Super, same as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-performance-best-settings">The Great Troy Bake Off</a>. While this might sound like Delta is following the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in requiring ray tracing, producer Noriaki Okamura <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">told Eurogamer last year</a> that no ray tracing features are included - so the RTX requirement is likely down to Unreal 5's Lumen lighting tech (although that can <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine">include ray tracing techniques</a> anyway.)</p>
<p>You can find the full requirements below and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">on Steam here</a>, in a notably less attractive font than classic Rock Paper Sans.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>

<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows® 10, Windows® 11 (64-bit OS required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong> RTX 2060 Super (8GB)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>

<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> requires just 8 GB? It's not entirely fair to compare the two, I just wanted to marvel at that install size. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-requirements-revealed">Eurogamer note</a> that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-system-requirements-are-here-and-its-yet-another-game-that-requires-an-rtx-graphics-card-and-tonnes-of-free-storage-to-play/">PC Gamer note</a> and RPS is now noting, Delta uses Unreal 5 instead of the studio's previous FOX engine, and Unreal 5's (usually optional) Lumen lighting requires an RTX 2000-series or later card if you want to use its hardware-based ray tracing effects. Eurogamer also note that the PC version includes the Snake vs Monkey minigame with Ape Escape characters, although the ancient Bomberman fan in me is a little jealous that that minigame is exclusive to Xbox.</p>
