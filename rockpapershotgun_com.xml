            <p>I was rubbing along pretty well in House Of Necrosis before I hurled a vial of unidentified black serum at a squashy purple Devourer. I was hoping the serum would be some kind of poison - I mean, come on, an unidentified black serum? You wouldn't pour that on your chips. It turned out to be an XP potion, which transformed the Devourer into a Foul Devourer - still squashy, still purple, but with much sturdier defence.</p>
<p>I managed to recover some of the accidentally donated XP by lobbing a cheeky hex, but not enough to boost the stopping power of my homely pawnshop knife and pistol. So down I went in a pool of that special red serum the billionaires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/13/rich-men-longevity-history">like to drink</a> when they're feeling mortal.</p><!--more-->
<p>Imagine if this had happened while you were playing the original Resident Evil on PS1. Imagine hurling a bottle of unspecified weirdness into the blindspot immediately after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntFBVXqPg">the Hunter's first appearance</a>, and hearing a cheery level-up chime. You'd have ripped the power cable out of the wall. You'd have sworn to track down Shinji Mikami and make him eat his own socks. Unless, that is, you'd already played a few Mystery Dungeon games, which do this kind of nonsense all the time.</p>

<p>I described House Of Necrosis as "OG Resident Evil but turn-based" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-battlefield-6-fends-off-an-onslaught-of-cool-indie-rpgs-strategy-games-horror-games-and-piss-simulators">the latest Mawmouth</a>, which isn't inaccurate but (as reader SeekerX pointed out) omits plenty. This neato <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is a tribute to both Capcom and Spike Chunsoft. It sees you exploring a zombie mansion made up of grid-based floor layouts full of randomly distributed enemies, treasures and traps. You've got to find the next floor while sprucing your stats and gathering items. </p><p>It's a game of pleasurable/maddening occult surprises. For example, I was spared death at the claws of an AOE-slopping boss monster by a teleport trap, which whisked me off to a room stocked with green herbs. Thankfully, these do exactly what you're expecting. For people who can't get enough of that old-timey survival horror, there's also a hub environment with proper tank controls.</p>
<p>House Of Necrosis is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/">out now on Steam</a>, still has a demo at the time of writing, and seems jolly, going by the early user reviews. I did enjoy my brief time with the Foul Devourer, though I feel like the game's devout 32-bit murkiness may wear out its welcome, next to the crisper anime stylings of regular Mystery Dungeon. Shame it doesn't appear to be Steam Deck Verified - this feels like it would make a fine portable play. You can also find developer Warkus on <a href="https://warrrkus.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> - they're certainly fond of fifth generation consoles.</p>

            <p>****, we didn't mean for that to happen. This has been the response from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> developers Activision to folks spotting that you couldn't type the name of fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> into the chat of the game's beta without it being censored. Yep, you could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">reportedly</a> get away with Arc or Raiders, but stick the two together, and it was off to the starred-out naughty corner.</p>
<p>Naturally, folks wondered why this was a thing, especially since you could chat about more obvious Black Ops 7 competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> to your heart's content without facing any star-based repercussions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/activision-angles-for-the-most-petty-corporation-prize-by-censoring-the-name-arc-raiders-in-black-ops-7s-lobbies/">Penguin Choir Gamer</a>, a text filter error was to blame according to Activision. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/">Insider Gaming</a> report having been offered more specifics regarding the nature of the error, with Activision saying it was down the word 'Arc' being listed as an alternative for a naughty word, and pairing it with 'Raiders' caused the moderation system to flag up an inappropriate phrase.</p>
<p>It seems strange that if 'Arc' was the root of the issue, you'd only be pinged upon adding the seemingly innocuous 'Raiders', but hey, text filters can be weird sometimes. A quick stealth patch has since been issued and it's now possible to type out Arc Raiders' name. It's also worth noting that the EA had to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">resolve a similar Arc Raiders name censorship issue with their app earlier this year</a>, so it very much looks like this is just a standard text moderation quirk.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>At least Arc Raiders devs Embark Studios have been able to have a bit of fun with the free publicity they've gotten out of the misbehaving filters.</p>
<p>Even if this had been down to shooter publishers cheekily blocking out competitors' names from their games' chats, that'd probably rank relatively low on the outrage scale for me. An inconvenience perhaps if you're talking to mates and comparing two shooters while playing, but there's plenty of third-party chatting software that'd seem a more practical forum for such discussions anyway. Or maybe I just need to get better so I can comfortably type out 'I see your point esteemed colleague, but I feel the recoil of [insert game]'s guns is exactly three per cent more satisfying' in between headshots.</p><p>You could also discuss the ups and downs of ***** *** *, *********** *, and *** ******* in the RPS comments section instead. The former's beta has just been extended to run until October 9th, if you weren't already aware.</p>

            <p>
The factional asymmetry of Mars Tactics ain’t about Fish Himbos vs The Telepathic Hairdryer Folk of the Highlands. It gives you the bracingly topical choice of suits vs revolutionaries. In the blue corner, you’ve got the iron fist of Capital, who begin each campaign in a position of supremacy, but are beholden to the fatter cats on Earth for supplies. And in the red corner, you’ve got Labo(u)r, who kick off with little more than their chains, but are able to manufacture their own gear due to being honest working folk, and have higher morale due to being a bunch of zealous bolshies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can tailor their differences further by means of governmental policies. Introducing Universal Basic Income, for instance, means you can deploy robot workers without riling up your fleshy dogsbodies quite as much. Fully automated luxury communism for all! Except you, Kevin - I'm sending you off on a doomed mission to reclaim that rocketpad from the fuzz. You can also found a police state, set up labour camps, and embrace neoliberalism, if you're feeling especially dystopic. More pragmatic research projects include fermentation: if ideology alone won’t carry the day, perhaps some liquid courage will do the job.

Between Capital and Labor sprawl the deserts of Mars: curiously cuboid, usefully deformable, and rich in building components. To claim the wargod’s favourite planet, you’ll need both a shrewd understanding of cover and a head for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. You need to capture and defend resource hubs, build railways, and get hold of some jets for troop movement and airstrikes. You need sturdy offworld trade connections. You might want to hire a few mercenaries.
</p><p>
The battles are turn-based, and waged by squads of upgradeable, customisable troopers. They look a lot like XCOM, perhaps with a splash of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a>. You can suppress foes both to sabotage their aim and steal initiative from them. You can also gouge out trenches with explosives, call in artillery strikes from neighbouring regions, and toss unprimed grenades or spare magazines of ammo between friendlies. Foes can be captured, then interrogated for intel, then held for ransom. As for the guns, there’s a phat grid editor that includes a choice of scopes, stocks, calibers, and receivers.
</p>
<p>
It all seems very appealing, though I’m basing that assessment on trailers and snatches of press release – please qualify my enthusiasm appropriately. I am crossing my fingers for 1) a demo, and 2) a Total Recall-inspired endgame involving underground terraformers. Please, though, no boggle-eyed Arnie death scenes.
