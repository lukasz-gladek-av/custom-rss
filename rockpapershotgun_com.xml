            <p>
A few years ago, it's entirely possible that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> isn't the current talk of a town called Didn't Work. But now, when everyone wants a piece of the live service pie, it's not so easy to come in and claim some for yourself. We could spend an eternity figuring out what went wrong, but perhaps the words of former senior level designer on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> Alex Graner will provide a particular insight that the comment section of an annoying YouTuber won't.
</p>
<p>
Graner recently made an appearance on the Quad Damage podcast (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGamesN</a>), where he explained that when he joined developed Wildlight, they were "trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries. You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player."
</p>

<p>
Graner specifically said he felt that the game "leaned too far into the competitive scene," particularly when development shifted the game towards a 3v3 format. "3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it. It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."
</p><p>
He did, of course, point to that "spotlight" placed upon it at Geoff's Night of Statues and Trailers, adding a lot more pressure for it to do well. But, Graner notes, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came out at a time where battle royales were still fresh and new, Highguard instead arrived with some tough to learn rules and a high skill floor. "If you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game… I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, I think Graner is at least partially correct here. I haven't bothered with Highguard myself, just not my vibe, but the little I've experimented with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has me feeling similarly. I'm just not good at shooters and people are ruthless! In any case, the 3v3 mode certainly isn't the only problem, as based on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-went-wrong-with-highguard-the-hubris-of-its-developers-leadership-say-former-staff-in-a-new-report">recent report</a>, it sounds like leadership needs to shoulder a heavy load of the blame too.

            <p>
Last year, Owlcat announced they were working on another CRPG set within the world of Warhammer 40,000 called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Dark Heresy</a>. This would have potentially led to an assumption that they were done with their previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, but nope! They're still going, and a brief teaser for that CRPG's next bit of DLC was shared (and when I say brief, I do mean it), and to wet your appetite, some gameplay for Dark Heresy is there to have a look at too.
</p>
<p>
The DLC is titled The Infinite Museion (how often do you think that's going to get autocorrected to Museum, wasting the time of Warhammerers everywhere), and it's all about investigating the secret vault of one Trazyn the Infinite. Now, I know diddly squat about Warhammer lore, but a name like that certainly has a foreboding atmosphere about it.

"Discover Trazyn’s obsession with the Von Valancius dynasty, and choose whether to disrupt or fulfill his plans," reads the DLC's description on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4226770/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__The_Infinite_Museion/">Steam</a>. "Explore a glimpse of his fabled collection, claim priceless relics, and face off against guardians that defy understanding. A new companion joins your retinue with a distinct combat style that reshapes battlefield tactics. This expansion brings a new questline, a new mechanic - implants - that can be used strategically in battle, and a deeper dive into Necron conflicts."

<p>
There's no release date attached to this one, however, not even for this year, so you'll have to hold out for now. However, the gameplay for Dark Heresy has a bit more meat on its bones, though only a bit. Mostly it shows off the middle of a battle between your party of characters and some nasty baddies, offering a glimpse of the kind of actions and strategies you can take. Hard to glean how fun it is from such a brief look, and it's only alpha gameplay, but it's better than nowt! No release date here either, so, wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">here</a> I suppose?

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a> is a game that whenever I see it I just think "oh, that can't be right, games like this don't actually exist do they?" Arguable, until it's actually out, its existence is neither here nor there. But at the very least for the month of February, instead of talking at us lot in their monthly devlogs, developer Ion Lands opted to show off a little snippet of the game's opening moments to tide us over until release.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the game starts as many often (perhaps too often) do, with you waking up not quite entirely sure of what's going on, though you quickly learn from a voice in your head called Ava that there's a serial killer on the loose. Not particularly life <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simy</a>! But quite cyberpunk, so, it balances it out.

There's a little look at the kind of finagling you'll be doing as you set up your restaurant, too, mostly just setting up some tables and chairs. I like the look of the approach to doing so - there's no grid to place the tables on, so they might not look exactly perfect, but anyone that's worked in such an environment will know that your tables can never be perfectly placed. To compensate though, chairs do snap to specific spots, so some amount of order is possible to establish.
</p><p>
Mostly I like the tiny glimpses of the weirdo cast of characters the game features. A guy called Thaddeus who just talks at you about making choices, a robot called "Salt Pete" as opposed to "Salty Pete," an obnoxious IRL Twitch streamer, an android sailor that clearly wants me to ask him about his boat. These are all people I want to talk to (maybe less so the Twitch streamer), and maybe even get to know from just a sliver of dialogue, so that bodes well.
</p>
<p>
Ion Lands <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/515236085341618869">do note</a> that "the footage should not be considered final," which doesn't make it any clearer how far away the thing is from being finished (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nivalis-catches-yet-another-delay-this-time-into-2026-but-it-sounds-like-its-for-fair-reasons">it received a second delay last year</a>), but in the meantime you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/">here</a>.
