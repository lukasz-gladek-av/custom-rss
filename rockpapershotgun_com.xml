I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.
