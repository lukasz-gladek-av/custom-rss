<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWa0dZMHYeE&amp;ab_channel=asphnxma">It is happening again</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting another huge update filled with all sorts of new things to do, and because there's so much, we'll just jump straight into it. First of all, the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game just lets you become a mayor of a town now. Or, I guess an Overseer as described in the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/">patch notes</a> (it says mayor in the trailer), a role that lets you look after four settlements by governing their inhabitants and investing in their infrastructure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Settlement management has had a revamp, with every building within town now featuring its own "calculated contribution to the happiness, population and productivity of the settlement." Settlers have unique information pages with tidbits about their strengths, weaknesses, skills, and even personalities, and citizen disputes have had a big rework too, getting rid of any ambiguity, and adding in a lot more resolutions.

<p>
You'll be able to come across Autophage settlements, inhabited by robotic lifeforms that like to keep their secrets. "Travellers who have encountered the Autophage can join these settlements as Overseer, and those who have earned their trust may receive a special invitation…"
</p>
<p>
If you've recruited any pilots to your squadron, they can now defend against pirate raids, settlements can now feature fishing ponds, you can customise your own player voice, and you may also need to protect your settlement from the "vile insect queen and her brood." This isn't even all of it, there's a huge swathe of features being added like the full release of cross-save compatibility, more resource production opens for debt-free settlements, the list just goes on and on, so I'll let you dig into the nitty gritty for yourself.
</p>
<p>
This update, which is somehow free, is available to check out now.

            <p>
It's been quite a while since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/grasshopper-manufacture">Grasshopper Manufacture</a> put out a completely original game, almost a decade in fact, with 2016's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/let-it-die">Let It Die</a>. Since then there's been a couple <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>, but during a presentation held last night from some company I've never heard of, PlayStation I think it was, the developer revealed something wholly new: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>. This was easily my personal highlight because of how balls to the wall stupid it looks, but it was missing an important thing known as a release date that a lot of other games actually featured for once. And that's almost definitely because Grasshopper is a bit worried about GTA 6.
</p>
<p>
"At this point, our development team is working at full force to get this thing finished," executive director and studio founder Goichi "Suda51" Suda said in a press release. "Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly. I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened)."

<p>
When asked directly about why Romeo Is A Dead Man has a release window as vague as 2026, Suda51 quite plainly said "That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it? That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."
</p>
<p>
Yeah, that all sounds like Suda51 alright. Romeo Is A Dead Man certainly sounds like one of his games too. It follows the titular Romeo, an FBI Space-Time special agent (sure!) whose grandfather uses some fancy tech to stop him from dying, so he's in a constant state of being between life and death. 
</p>
<p>
As him you'll go hunting for fugitives across multiple universes, slicing them up in impeccable gory fashion with a big ole sword. It is undoubtedly a future 7/10 in the making, and I couldn't be more thrilled.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-bruisers-who-develop-guilty-gear-are-making-a-marvel-fighting-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developers who create Guilty Gear, the punishing 2D fighters with slick anime visuals, are working on a Marvel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> in partnership with the comics giant. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is a flashy over-the-top wreck sesh, at least judging by the trailer shown off during last night's State of Play, the showcase of new games by Playstation. You can very quickly see how punchin' pros Arc System Works have put their own spin on some Marvel staples such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Storm. There is a (to me) terrifying catch - the fights are 4v4 tag battles.</p>

<p>Wonderful. Total chaos. No idea who is even punching who. The 4v4 tag element is scary to me, yes, and the developers appear to anticipate such trepidation, seeking to reassure players that there will be means of simplifying fights if you are likewise overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game," said game director Kazuto Sekine in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">a PlayStation blog</a>. "We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together...."</p>
<p>Characters will have "normal" , "special" and "unique" attacks, we're told, as well as "ultimates" that align with their characters' particular wheelhouse. Ghost Rider does a lot of whipping, and his motorbike will make a violent appearance. Storm will cause a vicious whirlwind. You get the idea, but here's the full roster of fighters, because I know you want to see if Taskmaster is there (he's not). </p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Star Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Ms Marvel</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Doctor Doom</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a decent slice of the Marvel pie. Regarding their visual design, the developers reportedly went back and forth with Marvel, trying to stick to some traditions. But some honchos at Marvel kicked the designs back and insisted the devs do things their own way.</p>
<p>"Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style," said Takeshi Yamanaka, "but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more Arc-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style Arc is known for."</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. Arc System Works are generally well-respected fighting game developers among fisticuffs fans, having continued the Guilty Gear series for years, most recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>. They also made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, which contributor Aron Garst enjoyed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-pc">review</a>, and the equally outlandish BlazBlue brawlers, which everyone at RPS is afraid to play. That includes me, the only person here who likes fighting games. I am not fooled by Arc System Works' words of reassurance, I just <em>know</em> Dr Doom is going to crush my windpipe and I won't get a single hit in. I'll stick to my beloved Tekken. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
