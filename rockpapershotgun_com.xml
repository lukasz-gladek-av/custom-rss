            <p>Skatebird, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>, and Electric Zine Maker are three of the 237 games you can grab on Itch right now for $16 as part of <a href="https://itch.io/b/2965/crips-for-esims-for-gaza-bundle">Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle</a>. Why, that's a $822 saving! I mean, it's technically not a saving if you weren't going to buy anything anyway, but it's for a good cause. Here's the collective in their own words:</p>
<p>"Crips for eSims for Gaza is an international collective of disabled people who have come together in support of Palestinans, helping Gazans regain internet access via eSims (electric sim cards) connected to surrounding networks in Israel and Egypt," reads their <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/">Itch page</a>. "We recognize that everyone in Gaza is now in some way disabled due to the massive number of deaths, traumatic injuries, life-threatening illnesses and near complete destruction of medical facilities".</p>

<p>They've also made a <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/what-is-an-esim">printable mini-zine</a> explaining the importance of e-sims, which is more than I've ever done to explain an indie soulslike's parry system but maybe I should start.</p>
<p>Baba Is You is a personal favourite here. John (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baba-is-you-review">was keen too</a>. "Sublimely refined in every respect," wrote he. "It understands the player, letting you reset a screen with a single button, never penalising you for undos, and even lets you switch off its wibbly-wobbly graphic effect if it starts to drive you potty."</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/">collective's website here</a>. And remember, kids: There is no culture war, there are simply your feelings on the appropriate response to tyranny - disgust or cowardly, Stockholm-ish acquiescence. Enjoy video games!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
