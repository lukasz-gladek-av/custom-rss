I won't lie, sometimes when I hear a string of words like "beautiful hand-drawn Metroidvania with challenging combat etc., etc.," my eyes do start to glaze over a bit. It can be a bit buzzwordy! But, gosh, that there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-eternal-life-of-goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> looks a bit stunning doesn't it? It was shown off last month during Nintendo's Not Switch 2 Direct, but earlier this week it received another trailer offering another look, and more importantly, who'll be composing it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There'll actually be a few people making music for the game, though the trailer is geared around Yasunori Nishiki, whose work you'll have most recently heard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth through a few arrangements. He's worked on a few other Square Enix games too, like helping out on Final Fantasy 7 Remake and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, and he's the lead composer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series. I've not played any of them but I have heard a few tracks from them and they all have quite lovely scores, so Nishiki seems like a pretty damn good get.

<p>
He'll also be joined by the likes of Kevin Penkin (Florence, Star Wars: Visions), Mason Lieberman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a>), and Pete Lepley (Wargroove, Sky Rogue). The new trailer is quite cute, as it's framed as Nishiki not having started working on any music yet, with the other three composers giving him some friendly, perhaps contrasting advice.
</p>
<p>
The music that has been made so far is sounding good too. I'm really quite fond of how the game has an elderly protagonist too, despite being an action-focused game. Love it when a game knows anyone can be the hero!
</p>
<p>
Currently The Eternal Life of Goldman doesn't have a release date, but you could always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
The time is almost upon us all to prepare for the end of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and by end, I mean the RPG's final big update. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/larian-studios">Larian</a> cheekily shared last year that it'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors">one final hurrah</a> in spite of the fact they'd said that patch 7 would be the last major one. Now, in a quick little video posted to the official Larian YouTube channel yesterday, the developer confirmed that patch 8 will be dropping April 15th next week. There's even a special little livestream coming April 16th, 9am EST/ 2pm BST where senior systems designer Ross Stephens will be chatting about the game, alongside a look at the new patch.
</p>

<p>
It's also quite a doozy of an update! For starters, there's cross-play coming with this one meaning you'll be able to play with, well, anybody. There's also a photo mode coming with this game, something that'll really elevate Baldur's Gate 3 to the 2000s era dress-up game it deserves to be. Looks pretty in-depth too, lots of settings to fiddle around with, lots of ways to make your party members look even hunkier.

<p>
The biggest addition to the game is definitely all the new subclasses. There's one for each of the main classes, all of which come with new abilities, summons, cantrips, that sort of thing. Clerics will have access to the Death Domain subclass, for example, which comes with some new necromancy cantrips and spells. 
</p>
<p>
I quite like the look of the Wizard's Bladesinging subclass, which lets you use a sword to cast your spells, plus an ability that gives you "supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make."
</p>
<p>
Larian have said that there might be a few smaller updates to come, but in the meantime they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">cooking up something new</a>, whatever that is.
