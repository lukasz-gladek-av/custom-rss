            <p>In bygone ages, Christian clerics would spend decades hunched over scrolls of vellum and parchment, ornamenting the text with scenes of questing knights, creeping chimeras, spiralling verdure, and perhaps the occasional bare bottom, as a treat. They would sacrifice their wits and tendons to the cultivation of microcosms, planted in the eyes of capital Os, or growing around the bars of capital Es.</p>
<p>Now, you can crap on their efforts by slapping together rad illuminated pages in seconds in a video game editor. That game is Scriptorium: Master of Manuscripts, a book-adorning sim from the creators of pen-and-paper (hah!) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inkulinati">Inkulinati</a>. It's got a playtest running till 10th July.</p><!--more-->

<p>"Fulfil orders from prestigious patrons by making your own designs on pages of medieval books," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3119540/Scriptorium_Master_of_Manuscripts/">the Steam page</a>. "Create, get paid, and unlock new orders, design elements, and grow your workshop. And with time and practice, your works and fame may reach the Queen herself!"</p>
<p>There are over 1000 scene elements to choose from, all apparently based on real-life medieval manuscript art, and client requests will range from the "quaint" to the "bizarre". You can also take on commissions from let's players, via mechanisms yet to be explained, and "export your in-game designs and create medieval memes to share with your friends".</p>
<p>Memes, eh. Hildegard of Bingen is spinning in her grave.</p>
<p>The playtest includes a stretch of the game's story mode, where you can complete 17 commissions for six clients. There's also a sandbox mode, which includes all the assets from the story. This being a playtest, expect "bugs, rough edges, and weirdness". You might want to try Inkulinati out, too - Rachel (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-enjoyed-pentiment-inkulinatis-cheeky-ink-based-strategy-is-a-great-history-lesson">expressed enthusiasm</a> for its monk-on-monk action and "uppity bishop cats". A concluding brainfart: is there such a thing as illuminated computer code? Code that has been decorated in some way, to make reading it feel vaguely sacred? If not, should there be?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/create-sacred-obscene-or-cringey-medieval-art-in-the-playtest-for-scriptorium-an-illuminated-manuscript-sim]]></content:encoded>

"I am going to screw on my happy cap and try to find some upbeat/quirky news, because I feel like we could do with a bit," I declared to the RPS Slack just now, after writing our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">eighth layoff/cancellation post</a> this week. The very next thing I click is a link for a game about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842300/Hell_Builder/">building hell</a>. Not today, Satan. "Amnesia flying meat orb! Amnesia flying meat orb!" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qpJsLRhvUk">suggests</a> James. James, you are not helping. Why are you never helping. Oh, what's this? An unbeatably broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-bosses">Elden Ring Nightreign bossfight</a>? Perhaps this is the champion who will lead us out of our endless technofeudal apocalypse. No seriously, I think Animus, Ascendant Light is really onto something, here.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The misfiring FromSoft bossfight in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Nightreign's enhanced Everdark Sovereign edition</a> of the Sentient Pest, which is actually three bosses in one. The basic version of that fight pits you against two huge insects. The enhanced edition adds a massive red moth which swoops in when you kill one of the other two and possesses it, reviving the creature in a powered-up state.</p>
<p>You can damage the red moth by attacking the revived critters. The trouble is, Animus has been going AWOL. Despite a hotfix this week, players continue to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lrhc2e/we_killed_the_two_so_fast_that_animus_bugged_out/">report cases</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-is-struggling-to-squash-an-elden-ring-nightreign-bug-that-sees-its-new-third-boss-bug-vanish-from-a-notorious-duo-bug-fight-making-it-impossible-to-win/">Gamesradar</a>) of the battle extending indefinitely because the third boss refuses to show up. The trigger condition for this issue appears to be killing both the original bugs at the same time, but the situation remains murky. A permanent solution is <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1941051928022339943">forthcoming</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy this partly because it suggests Animus is refusing to play favourites between the two other pests, and partly because it feels like Animus has been taking notes from <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">Da Share Zone</a> - and who could blame a From Software boss for wanting to Just Walk Out, Skeleton (co-op player battles if your quick). These magnificent creatures have been getting their faces kicked off for a decade, with Youtubers dedicating whole careers to their dissection, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> specifically is a live service mincing machine. You could fill a kaiju birdfeeder with all the Sentient Pests players have chopped and shredded so far.</p>
<p>So good on Animus, I say. Good on it for washing its proboscis of the whole stinking debacle. Good on it for divesting from the GaaS industry. I am going to follow in its footsteps by refusing to come to work tomorrow. That'll teach the status quo who's boss.
