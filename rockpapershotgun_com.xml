Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair announced their intent to get into games publishing using some of that Scrooge McDuck-size swimming pool of money they've acquired over the past year. They already had a game signed up too, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">from Tales of Kenzera: ZAU developer Surgent Studios</a>, and today said indie dev has offered a small tease of a reveal at their upcoming psychological <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Dead Take.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For now the game is mostly wrapped in mystery, but it's apparently all about taking a look at the "darkest secrets" that lurk underneath the "glittering facade" that is the entertainment industry. You'll step into the role (pun intended) of an actor exploring a mansion to "piece together the story of how far a powerful executive will go to seal his legacy." There's object-based puzzles to solve, and you'll need to edit video clips you find to figure out what happened there. No full trailer just yet though.

<p>
In a statement Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim said that they're "being secretive" about the game "for a reason," continuing on to say that the "subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this.'" 
</p>
<p>
For some context, before getting into game development, Slim was an actor, having appeared in Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves and Napoleon, House of the Dragon, and on the video game front he was also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>' Bayek, as well as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera's</a> titular Zau. One can only imagine the stories any actor working on such big names might have.
</p>
<p>
Release date wise it's supposedly launching this year, but for now you can wishlist the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam</a>.

            <p>The State of Unreal 2025 showcase has just offered us a first glimpse at what playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> might look like, via an Unreal Engine 5 demo build that featured Ciri exploring the wilds and a village in Kovir. Kovir was also confirmed to be a location you'll visit in the final game, so start packing your bags.</p>
<p>In this tech demo, which you can watch below, CD Projekt and Epic showed off some of the Unreal Engine 5 tech that'll be aiming to make The Witcher 4 feel even more immersive than its already impressive predecessor when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">it drops</a>.</p>

<p>The demo kicked off with a merchant in a cart having his day entirely ruined by a monster, with Ciri then swooping in to quite literally pick up the pieces, as she embarks on a contract to hunt the monster that just killed the poor peddler. Things then properly transitioned into a Ciri-following build running on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second with all the raytracing bells and whistles at play.</p>
<p>We got a look at Ciri's horse Kelpie, whom you'll be riding about and if they're anything like Roach, crashing into something every five minutes. The devs even peeled back Kelpie's skin to show the engine simulating horse muscles as they run, which wasn't at all freaky.</p>
<p>Ciri then wandered from the countryside of Kovir - a mountainous region that forms part of the Kingdom of Kovir and Poviss located in the northwest of The Continent - into one of the area's villages, Valdrest. CD Projekt and Epic really played up all the immersive details that make up the likes of bustling marketplaces, with details like an innkeeper dynamically lobbing a Gwent cheat out of an inn's front door being highlighted.</p>
<p>It seems that may well be what happens to you too if you try to con some cardplayers, so you've been warned. After showing off some varying crowd density at a circus, the demo concluded by showing Ciri looking out at the city of Lan Exeter in the distance. According to the lore, that's Kovir's winter capital and a Venice-style major port city filled with canals, so getting to explore it for the first time in a Witcher game will no doubt be prime screenshot material.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 had the very Elven and French-feeling Beauclair and Novigrad could be just as breathtaking in a more grungy fashion, so it'll be interesting to see how Lan Exeter stacks up. I'm really keen to explore Kovir full-stop, since it's one of the fringe regions we've not heard too much about as The Witcher games have generally concentrated more centrally, aside from trips to Kaer Morhen. Regardless, it looks like we'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">waiting until about 2027</a> to set foot there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
