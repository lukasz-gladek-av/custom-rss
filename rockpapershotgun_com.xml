            <p>
Almost a year on from its initial release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> version 2.0 has been announced, slated for release next month on June 6th. There's a lot coming in this new update, namely a new area to head to, the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu." The story follows on from where the Sacrifice crisis was left off in previous chapters, seeing you "uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether."
</p>

<p>
You'll be able to wander around a new city, Failume Heights, which is filled with things like dessert stalls, tea houses, and pawnshops. Getting around this new city, and the original map, should be a bit easier too, as the 3D navigation system will be receiving an overhaul, with an added mini-map to help you keep track of where you are. Exploring Hollows will work slightly differently too, as there are new perception techniques that let you do things like finding clues to follow the flow of Ether.

<p>
What essentially looks like a 3D platformer minigame has been added in too where you play as Eous through different levels to gather up Star Anchor Data. An entire management minigame has been added in too where you get to run your own Suibian Temple. Here you send Bangboo out to explore to find different goods to sell.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, you'll also be able to change your Proxies' outfit, take part in a mech-battle event, take part in a new agent story, unlock new W-Engines, and a lot more. You can take a look at the teaser trailer above for more specifics.
</p>
<p>
There will, as is typical of many gacha games, be anniversary benefits like free pulls and a free standard S-Rank agent, plus some giveaways too. Seems a bit overwhelming to be honest, but in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> like this with the kind of character designs that it has, being overwhelmed almost seems like the whole point.

You know what the main thing that's holding me back from picking up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at launch is? The fact it doesn't have an option for duos. For the most part I'm a single-player only kind of person, and when I play something online I normally like to do so with just my partner. I imagine I'm not the only person this applies to, nor am I likely to be the only one who thought "I don't really want some rando called xX_fartmaster_Xx third wheeling my partner and me." Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> seem to be at least considering a two-player option for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a>.
</p>

<p>
Game director Junya Ishizaki recently spoke with IGN about the things he learned under <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s director Hidetaka Miyazaki. It's a great interview, but the main thing we're concerned with here is Ishizaki's comments on not having a two-player option. When asked why the option was omitted, Ishizaki quite plainly said that "the simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. 
</p>
<p>
"As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start."
</p>
<p>
Ishizaki went on to say that the team put a lot of effort into making something enjoyable and playable for solo players. However, because they were so focused on that, they "kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect." However! The director did also say that a duos mode "is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."
</p>
<p>
Considering it is good enough for me for now! Here's hoping the update comes before that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-an-elden-ring-film-on-the-way-from-alex-garland-and-george-r-r-martin">Elden Ring movie that's in the works</a> that I'm pretending doesn't exist.

            <p>
Have you ever immediately wishlisted a game on Steam based on aesthetics alone? I ask because that's just happened to me with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-living-things">All Living Things</a>, a stop-motion game inspired by The Ripley Scroll, a 15th-century alchemical manuscript. Doesn't that just seem like a guaranteed feast for the eyes? Developer MOXO self-describes it as an "animated art-book <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game", which feels perfectly apt for it. The general presentation is simple, this strange, alluring art book on a black background waiting for you to click around.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's apparently 12 puzzles to solve in total, "each reflecting a stage in the alchemical process." You have to select certain parts of the art book to set certain sequences in motion, resulting in some wonderfully tactile looking animations. The wild thing is that despite looking like real, hand-made claymation, <a href="https://x.com/stvulture/status/1907275427770400777">it's all been digitally sculpted</a>. You could have fooled me quite easily into believing otherwise if I hadn't confirmed it for myself.

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Discover the secrets of alchemical processes, the hidden secrets of world and even deeper secrets hidden within us…</p><p>All Living Things has a steampage, wishlist to be notified for the upcoming early demo!<a href="https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2">https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2</a> <a href="https://t.co/D3xJDSLRI2">pic.twitter.com/D3xJDSLRI2</a></p></div>— 𝖘𝖆𝖎𝖓𝖙 𝖛𝖚𝖑𝖙𝖚𝖗𝖊 (@stvulture) <a href="https://twitter.com/stvulture/status/1925525849022857381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure how the puzzles work, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681340/All_Living_Things/">Steam page</a> for the game is suitably vague and cryptic, hinting at how you'll be able to figure it all out but not quite laying things in front of you. There's no release date for the game just yet, not even a release window. That's ok with me, as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681490/All_Living_Things_Demo/">demo is due out June 10th</a>, meaning it won't be long before I can try and suss out what exactly this strange artbook game wants from me.
</p>
<p>
The thing that appeals most of all to me, outside of its aesthetic sensibilities, is that it's quite plain about there only being 12 puzzles. It really sounds like a game you could just spend your evenings ticking away at, figuring them all out in small doses, with the end quite close in sight. Love a game that knows when to stop, will definitely be checking this one out.
