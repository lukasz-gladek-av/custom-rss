            <p>If you're reading this, it may be too late. The mysterious genius behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s most popular flying car mod has just released its first update in a good while, alongside a fresh work that removes the speed limits the game applies to all of its vehicles.</p>
<p>It looks like the perfect recipe for my next trip to Night City ending with an shattered engine block wedged halfway up a skyscraper, and Keanny Reevhand standing next to it tutting.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=description">Let There Be Flight</a> by modder Jack Humbert, it arrived in September 2022, swapped the wheels of Cyberpunk's cars for working thrusters, and left plenty of folks wondering why dystopian futures are ever allowed to omit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O7qff_ezFE">flying cars</a>. After all, when the world's gone down the corporate tubes, surely you need to balance that out by letting people dream of drifting a futuristic VW golf ten thousand feet above the pavement?</p>
<p>I digress. Humbert's just updated Let There Be Flight for the first time since <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5208?tab=logs">June 2023</a>, which is welcome news since folks have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunk2077mods/comments/1lc5xj5/let_there_be_flight_back_2025/">reported issues</a> getting it to run with the game's more recent patches.</p>
<p>"I've been rewriting some parts of LTBF to better use in-game systems, and this has allowed for better state control of flight and input contexts, enabling native vehicle combat (handheld and vehicle-mounted) while flying," he wrote, "This should also make it more compatible with other vehicle-based mods (in theory), but I have yet to try things out on a wide scale...I have lots of ideas that I'd like to see implemented, and will try to get them finished to a point that you can at least try them out here."</p>
<p>Nice, but here's the kicker, alongside this update Humbert's uploaded his first new mod since 2022. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=description">Vehicle Speed Unlimiter</a> and gets rid of the automatic limits the game puts on car movement speed - as far as I can tell, the ones you'd bang your head against even if you modded or file tweaked a car to go beyond its base top speed value.</p>
<p>The mod's description says speeds above 400mph will be possible, and to make clear what that's done, a user with the handle Oranje3 has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155/?tab=forum&amp;topic_id=15695671">said</a> they've already used it to get a modded car up to 1222mph, and posted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22155?tab=images#lg=3&amp;slide=0">a screenshot</a> to back that assertion up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I now have a new mission in life. I'll have to find the time to get my Cyberpunk load order back to working order since I've not done a playthrough in a little bit, but if I do soon, I'll definitely be trying to better that speed. In a flying car too, assuming that doesn't prove a barrier to engaging warp speed.</p>
<p>If you want to try Vehicle Speed Unlimiter, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, while Let There Be Flight requires that plus <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4575">Input Loader</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">Redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>TallBoys and Critical Reflex have announced an open public playtest for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/militsioner">Militsioner</a>, the immersive sim in which you try to escape a town that swelters in the shadow of an extremely large, temperamental policeman. It would be nice to think the premise has gotten less relevant since we first covered the game in 2021, but I suspect that if you are currently living in, say, Los Angeles, you will find much to relate to. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest has yet to kick off, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041689326?l=english">sign up already on Steam</a>. It'll run for two weeks, and will contain "a fraction of the game with most of the mechanics", which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>- Lonely and needy giant with his wishes, attachments and emotions. Learn how to keep his mood in check or to hide when things go south.</p>
<p>- The town's district, packed with a variety of NPCs, items and secrets. All is systematic, interactable and changing based on the time of day</p>
<p>- Flood creeping in from below - when the giant feels bad, the whole town is submerged in water.</p>
<p>- Gifts to build relationships - most items can be gifted, resulting in unique reactions and outcomes.</p>
<p>- Stealth to hide from the giant's wrath - avoid the light and choose the right time to go for illegal options.</p>
<p>- Evading the giant's hand - hide under awnings and pipelines and wait for the right moment to run for it. The hand might not get everywhere, but it's faster than it looks.</p>
<p>- Complete player freedom. Almost every problem has multiple solutions. There are no wrong ways to play the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>The devs caution that this is a test build and as such, subject to change. In particular, you may notice some missing textures. If you're wondering how Militsioner has come along since we covered it last, they also posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041690500?l=english">progress report</a> earlier this month. Amongst other recent changes, the giant now has an inventory (meaning you can pick his titanic pockets) and the ability to take a day off, which improves his mood and may cause new routes to appear. Townsfolk will now report you for breaking and entering, but you can also persuade them to be your alibi if you're under suspicion.</p>
<p>I've been coming and going with imsims, lately. I think the genre needs some kind of shot in the arm. Perhaps by "shot in the arm" I really mean "King Kopper".
