            <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards Of The Coast have apologised for "mistakenly" sending a legal takedown to the creator of a free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod that adds a village inspired by and featuring characters from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The mod has attracted praise from Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who was naturally a bit piqued when it was taken offline.</p>
<p>Published on Nexus Mods on 16th March, the Baldur's Village mod in question was taken offline days later and placed "under moderation review". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13511816-dmca-request-issued-by-wizards-of-the-coast-llc/">According</a> to a Nexus Mods staff member, legal firm Reynolds Law PLLC sent a claim of copyright infringement on behalf of Wizards on 27th March.</p>
<p>The mod has now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">been restored</a>, following a player backlash, so go ahead and marry pixelart Astarion as you please. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">PCGamer</a> also have a statement from Wizards, who claim the strike was one big whoopsie.</p>
<p>"The Baldur's Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly - we are sorry about that," it reads. "We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!"</p>
<p>It's possible this has something to do with Vincke's intervention yesterday. In a predictably popular post on the Muskvine, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">wrote</a>: "free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth. Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.</p>
<p>"Protecting your [intellectual property] can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled," Vincke continued. "There are good ways of dealing with this."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">said</a> in their fan content policy that they're fine with people making mods based on their games, as long as they give them away for free, don't pass them off as Larian's own work, and don't do anything "inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging". Larian are not, however, the legal custodians of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world in which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> takes place.</p>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is informally set after the Larian RPG's ending, so beware spoilers if you're planning to install. Again, it's free, though the modders do run a Patreon. Given enough interest and crowdfunding, they hope to flesh out their chunk of the Forgotten Realms with further BG3 callbacks.</p>
<p>"Our next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline," the Nexusmod page FAQ explains. "Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the "capacity to entirely reallocate them", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," said management in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/?originalSubdomain=fr">the post on LinkedIn</a>. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>
<p>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</p>
<p>The company doesn't specify what that "mandate" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">not-our-fault spinlingo</a>. The statement says the axed workers are "going to enter the employment market" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.</p>
<p>"Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development," they added.</p>
<p>The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">cancelled a Deus Ex game last year</a>, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. </p>
<p>Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers</a> across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">process of "restructuring" was over</a>. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">closure of the Gothic developers</a>, the axing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">139 people from a Diablo IV support studio</a>, and just last week other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-and-perfect-dark-devs-crystal-dynamics-cut-staff-promising-that-current-projects-are-unaffected">layoffs at Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> co-creator and programmer Tarn Adams has made fleeting, whimsical allusion to the possibility of an Elf Fortress game in a new interview - a fleeting, whimsical allusion I will now pounce on and make an enormous deal of, because my goodness, man, you can't just say "Elf Fortress" and walk off whistling into the sunset. 
</p>
<p>
The topic arose during a discussion of why fantasy dwarves are a "fortuitous" archetype for a maddeningly system-driven game like Dwarf Fortress, in which half the fun is enjoying the tunnel vision of characters who will cheerfully neglect their responsibilities and doom their brethren because, for example, they're obsessed with crafting a mug that menaces with spikes of bituminous coal and alpaca wool. According to Adams, this is relatably "human", though he muddies things intriguingly by dropping a reference to androids, and allows players to weave stories around technical eccentricities and outright bugs, which can be read as instances of "dwarfy" fixation and excess. Elves? They don't work the same way. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/dwarf-fortress-dwarves-are-more-human-than-human-creator-says-theyre-allowed-to-embody-bigger-emotions-theyre-allowed-to-make-bigger-mistakes-theyre-allowed-to-do-anything/">a Parchment Gamer interview</a> at this year's Game Developer Conference, in which the Bay 12 co-founder reflects a little on the game's long development. "Dwarves turned out to be fortuitous, because they're sort of like - I don't know why it pops into my head - replicants from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>," Adams said. "More human than human. That's a dwarf."
</p>
<p>
Fantasy dwarves are "more human than human" because "they're allowed to embody bigger emotions," Adams went on. "They're allowed to make bigger mistakes. They're allowed to be stubborn. They're allowed to do anything." There's a kind of catharsis at work here, he said. "There's everything about it, from drunkenness to a very noble hubris. It's all there. Dwarves allow us to experience these different parts of ourselves that, in humanity, you might be more judgmental of." 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, "if you were playing an elf fortress, all of these stories would hit different," Adams said. "The antics they get up to, especially when it's a bit buggy or just being weird - I don't think elves would hit the same way. It'd be like 'What's going on with them?' Whereas with dwarves, you're like 'Nah, I know what's going on.'" The "devotion" of the dwarves supports the game's historically bloody-minded AI, he added, which has bred many internet legends of dwarves obstinately prioritising scavenging jobs while the fortress is being overrun.
</p>
<p>
"What are these AI agents but driven by the top need that has to be checked off right now? "Adams said later in the chat. "It feels right, even when it goes wrong, that they have that sense of devotion. It doesn't work for anything else quite the same way."
</p>
<p>
While I obviously defer to Adams's experience as the co-creator of by far the most elaborate manifestation of fantasy dwarfdom in video games, I can readily imagine a fortress or colony sim involving elves. I can imagine this partly because elves already exist in Dwarf Fortress. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/g36l0w/no_mods_elf_fortress/">have even managed to create Elf Fortresses in-game</a> - admittedly, "culturally dwarvish" ones - by cultivating an influx of poets, allowing all the original dwarf residents to die off, and appointing an elf as baron. 
</p>
<p>
I can also imagine an Elf Fortress games because elves are themselves a set of well-entrenched literary archetypes and psychological metaphors. There's the Warhammer High Elf/Rivendell portrayal of elves as a declining, noble caste of immortals, rendered passive and complacent by their technological advantages and gifts of foresight - condescending in their benevolence toward the mortals. There's the contrasting depiction of elves as seductive, murderous bluebloods  found in Terry Pratchett's Lords And Ladies. There are the tree settlements and fey naturalism of wood elves in various stories. There's the association of elves with forbidden scholarship, demon flirtations, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
Plenty of material. Building a game of Dwarf Fortressy depth around the persona and associations of an elf would be a hard labour - likely, it would take the Adams brothers another few decades. I wouldn't wish that on them. But given the magnitude of their accomplishment with Dwarf Fortress, I'd be fascinated to see them try.
