More like space the final funtier am I right (cue canned laughter that goes on a touch too long)? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a>, the physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> about building all manner of medieval machinery to destroy your enemy, has taken you to all kinds of lands and with its 2024 expansion, The Splintered Sea, a few oceans too. But with its newly revealed follow-up expansion, there's nowhere to go but up (because it's set in space, hence my absolutely hilarious opening line).
</p>
<p>
This next expansion, only sort of shown off in a brief teaser trailer, is called "The Broken Beyond," and sees you doing your usual thing of putting some wood and metal together until you've got something that could wipe out an army, but against aliens this time. "Put your engineering talents to the test as you master space flight, navigating gravitational fields, avoiding asteroids and other challenges using a suite of exciting new blocks," the expansion's Steam page description explains.

There's a new campaign to play through where you'll head to different planets, build some spacecrafts, and presumably make a space catapult. You'll also find new space themed blocks, a new sandbox to play around with, and suitably, some new physics mechanics. Details are slim aside from that, but I'm quite tickled by the commitment to sticking with that medieval aesthetic even in the far corners of the galaxy. It's certainly not a vibe for those who are particular about anachronisms, but to them I say find a different hobby.
</p><p>
The expansion doesn't have a release date as of yet, though its trailer says it should be coming in Q2 this year, so you don't have all that long to wait ultimately. And if you like, you can add it to your infinitely growing Steam wishlist right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639470/Besiege_The_Broken_Beyond/">here</a>.

            <p>
The single most offputting thing about a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, i.e. an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, is that every single other person you meet in-game is Schrödinger's asshole. They could be a friend who you share a story or some loot with, or they could mercilessly gun you down at the drop of a hat. It's certainly not for everyone, but in the game's latest update, a new PvE event has arrived encouraging everyone to walk hand in hand together to defeat those big bad bots.
</p>
<p>
This new event is called Shared Watch, described in-world as an "annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy, by celebrating those that look out for their fellow Raiders. Tolerate, team-up, or take out some Arc - it’s all in the spirit of the Shared Watch." The event is running from right now as you read this, through to February 24, and anyone that destroys, helps to destroy, or simply damages any Arcs can earn merits and rewards for doing so. However, killing others in PvP encounters won't get you anything, obviously to discourage you from doing so.
</p>
<p>
It's an interesting choice to leave friendly fire on, and I think conceptually one I broadly agree with. In an ideal world more people will help others than debilitate them, though the odd griefer is still all but guaranteed. This does raise questions as to how developer Embark should handle such people - are they shunned or punished for their nastiness, or are they ignored and the law of the people takes precedence? A moral quandary that will come to light in the coming days.
</p>
<p>
Outside of this, the Cold Snap map condition is returning to the rotation, so dress up warmly if you're heading out. You'll also be able to pick up the Vulpine and Slugger cosmetic sets. There's a few fixes and tweaks in this update, like an annoying issue where some couldn't reconnect after disconnecting from a game, and another where crafting would just randomly be cancelled. You can read the full patch notes on this handy blog post right <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">here</a>.
