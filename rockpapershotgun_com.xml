            <p>Blood. Blood. Bloooooooooddddddd. Sorry, I've just watched Rebel Wolves show off the first look we've gotten at someone playing vampire RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, and I think it's rubbed off on me a bit.</p>
<p>To be fair, you can't blame the group of ex-Witcher 3 devs for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">put together a game</a> that looks to use the B word more often than someone who's just gotten a nasty paper cut while handling some packets of the red stuff at a blood bank.</p>

<p>During a livestream this weekend just gone - June 21 to be exact - the devs delivered about 21 minutes of design director Daniel Sadowski demoing a "work-in-progress" pre-beta build of The Blood of Dawnwalker. He spent most of that time showing off a mid-game quest in the game's biggest city, Svartrau, which boasts four boroughs. Also, in true medieval European fashion, it's got a castle so big that even William the Conqueror would say 'phwoar'.</p>
<p>Rescuing your family from that fortress, dubbed Griefberg and currently ruled by a powerful vampire called Brencis, is the key to the game's main quest. You'll need to recruit help or find ways to make it easier to storm, while a timer ticking down in days next to the objective, showing you how long you've got left to plan before it's too late.</p>

<p>As for the quest Sadowski was showing off here, the main point of emphasis was the game's calling card - a day/night cycle that changes gameplay, with Coen's half-human/half-vampire nature making missions play differently depending on the time of day. For example, if you've got to get into a cathedral to look for clues, you might waltz in and meet a priest during the day, while at night, you'll have to use your sneaky vampire roof jumpy powers to break in and find spooky people up to no good.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see which I'll prefer when I get my hands on the game, but Sadowski was keen to emphasise that the choice and consequence goes beyond just having two options for each mission, with various paths depending on what you do and how exactly you opt to approach the scenarios the game lobs your way. One thing I am pretty sure of is that I'll be pretty bad at Dawnwalker's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2-ish sword combat at first, given fiddly directional attacking and blocking tends to really expose my unfortunate inability to press parry exactly on cue.</p>
<p>The demo ended with Coen getting into a boss battle with an elderly vampire called Xanthe and her blood guards, and towards the end of it, he just goes pop. No, seriously, Xanthe has a skill called boiling blood, and if you don't beat her quickly enough, Coen gets blood explosioned. As in, he explodes into a big splatter of blood. Clean up on aisle seven.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker's still on for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-the-vampire-rpg-from-former-cd-projekt-folks-is-coming-out-2026">a 2026 release</a>, so you've got a bit of time to mentally prepare to face the Dracula version of being Thanos snapped.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developers Build A Rocket Boy have reportedly initiated a redundancy process that could result in cuts affecting over 100 people.</p>
<p>This would follow the game's dire launch, which was plagued by bugs and performance issues, contributing to a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">largely negative</a> critical and player reception.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, staff have been notified the 45 day consultation period <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">required by UK law</a> when companies plan to enact 100 or more redundancies has begun today, June 23.</p>
<p>There's no concrete word as of yet as to exactly how many of Build A Rocket Boy's around 300 person UK workforce may be affected by the cuts, or whether any of the around 200 staff it has based abroad could also be at risk of being let go. IGN cites BARB co-CEO Mark Gerhard as insisting in an email to staff that the studio is still committed to working on MindsEye, and alluding to the switch in intensity between pre and post-launch development.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Build A Rocket Boy for comment.</p>
<p>If redundancies come to pass, this would be the second time the studio behind MindsEye has cut jobs this year. That February <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/build-a-rocket-boy-confirms-layoffs-weeks-after-raising-110-million">round of layoffs</a>, affecting a still unspecified number of staff, came not long after BARB <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-rockstar-north-boss-nets-110m-to-launch-what-sounds-a-lot-like-a-metaverse">secured $110 million</a> in private investment towards creating MindsEye, the metaversey platform called Everywhere that the game was initially supposed to launch as part of, and the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/">Arcadia UGC tools</a> that ended up becoming MindsEye's mission building/sharing bits.
</p>
<p>MindsEye launched on June 10, and Build A Rocket Boy have been quick to start releasing emergency patches to try and take care of its various bugs and issues, as well as attempting to improve how it runs on PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseyes-dire-launch-has-reportedly-already-lead-build-a-rocket-boy-to-warn-staff-layoffs-could-be-incoming]]></content:encoded>
