            <p>Videogame developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM have founded what they're calling "the first recognised workplace union in the UK games industry", operating as part of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. It's yet another twist in the tale of a once-feted development studio who are now heavily associated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">toxic layoffs, alleged fraud and diasporic feuding</a>.</p>
<p>"The recognition process provides workers and management with a strong framework to engage and negotiate on workplace-related matters," the unionised workers announce in a <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/">press release</a>, passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/workers-at-disco-elysium-studio-za-um-have-unionized">Game Developer</a>. "A committee of elected workplace representatives will regularly meet to discuss matters brought forward by the game developers at ZA/UM and management, with the support of union officials."</p>
<p>The press release notes the past couple of year's staggering quantity of mass layoffs, commenting that "job security [is] one of the union's central focuses". It includes thoughts from Eugenia Peruzzo, organising officer of the IWGB Game Workers Union, who comments that "recognition agreements lay the groundwork for a healthy relationship between the company and workers and rebalance the scale of powers after a few terrible years for the game industry and the redundancies we have seen happening at ZA/UM lately." Peruzzo is confident that more UK videogame workers will unionise. "Rest assured that this is not a one off, but this is an avalanche in the making," she says.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">much fuller write-up of the situation on GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which includes an interview with current ZA/UM president and Private Division co-founder Ed Tomaszewski. He observes of studio management's negotiations with the emerging union "that when we did talk about it, it was clear that recognising a union was core to our values as a studio, to be providing fair working practices."</p>
<p>In the GI piece, Tomaszewski also pushes back a little against some of the accusations or "characterisations" levelled at ZA/UM by certain former staff. I imagine that said former staff will be pushing back against Tomaszewski in turn.</p>

<p>ZA/UM have lost many of the people who made Disco Elysium a hit, but according to Game Developer, they now have "almost 100" people on the books after laying off a quarter of the studio and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancelling a Disco Elysium expansion</a> early last year. Their current project is Zero Parades, a colourful espionage CRPG James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">summarised</a> as "Disco Elysium in glasses and a moustache", adding that "it isn't always clear whether Zero Parades is inspired by Disco Elysium or beholden to it."</p><p>Many of the departed Disco Elysium staff are now working on spiritual successors of one kind or another. Over at Summer Eternal, several former ZA/UM staff including writers Argo Tuulik and Dora Klindžić are making Red Rooster, which was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">teased in curious book anthology form</a>. Longdue Games are making Hopetown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">a psychogeogratuitous RPG which Nic summarised as "Nathan Barley on the bus"</a>; their trueblood Disco complement includes ZA/UM's co-founder Martin Luiga, plus Piotr Sobolewski from outsourcing team Knights of Unity. Dark Math Games boast of former Disco motion graphic designer Timo Albert and former ZA/UM producer and investor Kaur Kender; they're making the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">recently renamed Tangerine Antarctic</a>, which has a "dopamine buffet".</p>
<p>I offer this summary to the next RPS staffer to write about ZA/UM-related matters, in frail hope that the situation won't be anymore complicated by then. Oh god, I've just remembered we haven't yet found out what former Disco writer Robert Kurvitz and artist Aleksander Rostov are making at their new outfit Red Info.</p>

        <p>Definitely no massive security disaster brewing there, nope</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It must have been a stressful few days for Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-reveal-massive-game-pass-ultimate-and-pc-pass-price-hike-concede-that-price-hikes-are-never-fun">Game Pass changes nobody likes</a>, admitting the first Xbox-branded handheld <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-prices-arent-too-bad-in-the-uk-but-tariffs-bite-in-the-us">costs a thousand bucks</a>, having to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">tell the Israeli military</a> that they need to see other people. Yeesh. No wonder they’re so intent on blowing off steam by taking a scythe to Windows 10 security updates this month, a move that will effectively end official support for the operating system.</p>
<p>With previous Windows version cutoffs, this would have been standard circle-of-life stuff. One system perishes, another is nourished with its bone meal. Except Windows 10 remains in use by millions of PC owners and players, mere days before its scheduled slaying on October 14th.</p>
<p>The exact proportion depends on who you ask, but it’s always a chunky one. The most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam hardware survey</a> puts Windows 10 usage at 32%, showing a strong affinity for the older OS even while most respondents (63%) are on Windows 11. Meanwhile, per <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/windows_10_statcounter/">The Register</a>, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202408-202509">Statcounter</a>’s random sample of assorted web users suggests that just over 40% of all PCs have stuck with Windows 10. That’s barely behind the Windows 11 figure of 49%.</p>
<p>By comparison, Windows 8 and 8.1 merely accounted for 4% of PCs shortly before they had their security updates binned in January 2023, according to Statcounter. So there’s evidently something unusually compelling about Windows 10 – or, perhaps, something offputting about Windows 11 – that’s keeping it disproportionately popular in its final hours. I’ll attest to that, actually. While, as current custodian of the RPS Rig, I’ve long had it running the latest version, I remain too accustomed to the Win10 interface to budge from it on my personal PC.</p><p>Sadly, there’s more to this than UI comparisons and market share pie charts. As The Reg point out, it’s one thing to leave unpatched security vulnerabilities on a handful of weirdo Windows 8 holdouts, and another thing entirely to wilfully put millions upon millions of Windows 10 users at risk. For an example of the kind of weakness that would go unfixed, this past June, Microsoft were forced to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/a-worrying-windows-secureboot-issue-could-let-hackers-install-malware-heres-what-we-know-and-whether-you-need-to-update">close a Secure Boot vulnerability</a> that would allow malware wielders to disable your PC's other security tools before seizing control of the OS. That's the same Secure Boot, of course, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> are making a mandatory system requirement.</p>
<p>There may be other, less dire but more widely-spread consequences, too. Capcom, for instance, recently warned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">multiple recent Monster Hunter games might cease to work</a> on Windows 10 after the 14th.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be surprising to see a last-minute tilt towards Windows 11, as users realise they’ve run out of procrastination time. I’ll be switching over myself, though that’s mainly because I use this rig for work and Ian Games Network said I had to. If you’re determined to stand by Windows 10, the closest thing to a concession that Microsoft will offer is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/extended-security-updates?r=1">Windows 10 ESU</a> (Extended Security Updates) programme, where you can get a year of extra updates for free, no strings attached, if you live in the European Economic Area. If not, you can still enrol by either a) backing up your Windows 10 PC, b) spending 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, whatever those are, or c) just bunging Microsoft your local equivalent of $30 USD in cash. No, that is not a joke. Well, in a sense it is. Just not the funny kind.</p>
