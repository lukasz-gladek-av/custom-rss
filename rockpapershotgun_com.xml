            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">reported</a> that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.</p>
<p>At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.</p><!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">statement in full</a> is rather robotic, and mostly just fleshes out the spokesperson's previous argument that Tencent is not, in fact, involved with anything military. It further argues that Tencent is not a "military-civil fusion", in response to the US defence department's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023145/dod-releases-list-of-chinese-military-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1260/">standing claim</a> that China's armed forces rely on "technology and expertise" provided by Chinese "companies, universities and research programs" that "appear to be civilian entities".</p>
<p>"As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the [Chinese Military Company] List is a mistake," the statement reads. "Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group."</p><p>The statement also specifies that the "CMC list" - which was introduced under the first Trump presidency, and is known inside the US government as the Section 1260H list - is distinct from another document, the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List, maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The point being that "inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company".</p>
<p>Tencent are about "to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake", during which they "will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List."</p>
<p>If it comes to a lawsuit, Tencent won't be the first Chinese company to go to court over their inclusion on the US federal government's list of "military-civil fusions". As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/">Reuters</a>, drone maker DJI and Lidar maker Hesai Technologies sued the Pentagon last year over their designations, though they're still on the list for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>God-wrecking MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> is going free-to-play next week after four months of paid early access. The game of omniscient deities scrapping over lanes and minions has been playable since September last year by early bird "founders" willing to pay some bucks (it had plenty of closed alphas since May too) but now it's finally opening up to the rest of us mere mortals. And it's throwing in a new "god" too, the genie-toting thief Aladdin. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It'll be free-to-play from Jan 14th, say developers Hi-Rez in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2437170/view/525331314946081986">a Steam post</a>. There'll be 45 playable gods, including the fresh addition of the thief from One Thousand And One Nights. Aladdin can trap enemy players in his lamp where they'll have to fight both the pilferer and his genie (you can read <a href="https://www.smite2.com/news/aladdin-closer-look/">more about his skills here</a> if you like). Other characters to be added in the free-to-play update include Mulan, Geb, Ullr, and Agni - all gods returning from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a>.</p>
<p>The usual many-laned Conquest mode will be there to induce many a teamfuss. But it'll also be adding a few extra game modes. Joust is a 3v3 single lane mode, for example, while Duel mode is a one-on-one scenario. Assault mode is also returning from the previous game, and is "similar to the regular conquest mode, but instead features a single lane and no jungle."</p>
<p>Lacking in Smite wisdom, we placed freelance offerings at the shrine of Matt Cox (RPS in peace) and he blessed us with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">early access Smite 2 review</a>. He thought it was okay, but noted that the supreme beings of Hi-Rez' pantheon have to compete with the agile and exciting heroes of Valve's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>. And the comparison does not make Thor et al look as godly as they might like to think. </p>
<blockquote>I haven’t spent a single second wishing I wasn’t playing Deadlock instead. Valve’s third-person MOBA shooter has emerged with wildly unfortunate timing for Hi-Rez, rendering me incapable of not dwelling on how it innovates where Smite stagnates. Smite sells itself as the MOBA where every shot’s a skillshot, but Deadlock is the MOBA where every shot is an actual shot, comboed with a sprinting dodge-jump into a powerslide.</blockquote>
<p>It's god eat god out there in the MOBA realms, my friends. Meanwhile, Hi-Rez are not shutting down Smite 1, they say, but their attention has shifted heavily to the sequel. In October, the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">laid off a number of workers</a>, leaving only small teams to work on "light updates" for both Smite 1 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In a fairly exciting case of two major industry stories meeting in the middle, former members of downfallen indie publisher Annapurna Interactive have reportedly joined forces to take control of several game projects previously published by Take-Two Interactive's label Private Division, which has itself been sold off amid layoffs. The game projects in question include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series and an unannounced project from Pokémon developer Game Freak.</p>
<p>That's from a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">Bloomberg</a> article (paywall), helpfully summarised by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-acquire-take-two-s-private-division-label">Game Developer</a>. To give you the backstory here, Annapurna Interactive are a division of fancy-dan auteur-driven media company Annapurna Pictures, known for films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle. Founded in 2016, the Interactive label are the publishers of such acclaimed smaller game projects as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>. Notwithstanding the critical success of these projects, there have long been tensions between Annapurna Pictures leadership and the gaming division. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">entire staff of Annapurna Interactive resigned in September 2024</a>, after the failure of negotiations to spin the label off as a separate company.</p>
<p>Then, in November, Take-Two announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-two-are-selling-private-division-and-closing-roll7-and-intercept-because-theyre-in-the-business-of-making-great-big-hits">sell Private Division</a>, while also confirming the closure of OlliOlli World devs Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 devs Intercept Games. Private Division are comparable to Annapurna Interactive in publishing "mid-tier" games like Rollerdrome and After Us, that have a particular combination of artsy-experimental and blockbuster polish - the broad idea being to enhance Take-Two's prestige as a publisher of innovative work and establish revenue streams beyond the vast empires of Rockstar and 2K Games. Or at least, that's my impression, based on years of preview events.</p>
<p>It's the kind of venture that gets chopped when the old "economic headwinds" are a-blowing and investors aren't seeing desired returns, even when the operation is making money. "The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick observed back in November. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p><p>Which brings us to today. According to Bloomberg, a new, currently unnamed team of former Annapurna Interactive staff have struck a deal with private equity firm Haveli, the new owners of Private Division, to take control of several Private Division projects and franchises.</p>
<p>The deal doesn't cover everything Private Division were working on at the time of their sale. For example, it doesn't include two new projects from Yellow Brick Games and Bloober Team, which Private Division were to publish: Yellow Brick will self-publish their game, while Bloober's deal with Private Division has been fully dissolved. As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">Annapurna executives are now hiring staff</a> so they can follow through on existing obligations.</p>
<p>I have a lot of love for Annapurna Interactive's line-up, particularly The Outer Wilds, and am happy to see a few of the people involved with those projects striking up afresh under a different banner. I hope the former Private Division members who've lost their jobs as part of the sale have similar success elsewhere. I am also curious to hear about the new Game Freak game, though given Game Freak's heavy association with Nintendo, I wouldn't be surprised if it was exclusively for consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
