How about that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-official-control-2-is-control-resonant-a-paranatural-melee-brawler-with-shapeshifting-hittin-sticks">Control Resonant</a>! What was previously referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> now has its own name, and its own protagonist, Dylan Faden, the tongues-speaking brother of the first game's heroine Jesse. Gone is her shapeshifting gun too, replaced with a shapeshifting bit of metal instead. The horrors of the Oldest House have spilled out into New York City, Jesse is MIA, and Dylan must bash his way through it all to find her in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>-esque manner. Interesting enough a setup, but I am bothered by one thing: Remedy say you don't need to play the first game to play this one.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/control-resonant-brings-a-new-paranatural-crisis-to-ps5-out-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that came with the official reveal last night, co-creative director at Remedy Mikael Kasurinen laid it out for us. "You don’t need to have played the first Control to experience Resonant," he wrote. "It’s a new story and a fresh entry point into Remedy’s world of the Federal Bureau of Control - though returning players will recognize familiar echoes of Jesse’s path and the mysteries binding these two siblings together."
</p>
<p>
This isn't a surprising thing in that by the time Control Resonant releases next year, if it does, it will have been seven years since the first one came out (the same amount of time that has passed in-world). It's just quite frustrating, because when the studio said <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/">the same thing about Alan Wake 2</a>, it was only true on a technical level. Sure, it was easy enough to follow, but there really is so much to it that you'll need to have played the first one to fully appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Seven years in-world is obviously a convenient amount of time to help justify the lack of a need to play a previous game. It is just a frustrating trend that has been born out of a desperation to, I assume, make certain sales figures. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth's co-director even said <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1665705101196136448">you don't have to play Remake beforehand to enjoy it</a>, which is nonsense of the highest order.
</p><p>
Sequels are not an inherently bad thing, and if you can only make them in a fashion where you need to bring in new people, thusly potentially alienating what drew people in in the first place, I question why you're making a sequel at all. Hell, Remedy are trying to build a whole universe here - why not be brave and go the whole hog, try something actually new?
</p>
<p>
Mayhaps I am being a curmudgeon, I would like to note that I do think the actiony, whompy bits look Sick as Heck, and will be eager to check it out whenever it does end up releasing next year. But I won't pretend that I don't need to play Control.

            <p>Have you showered yet today? No? Then maybe treat yourself to a bath if you can. It might help prepare for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Capcom formally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">confirmed last night</a> that, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">leaked</a>, it contains Leon Kennedy. Some of their devs have now offered a bit more detail as to how it'll feel to play as both him and co-lead Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa revealed that the time number of sections you'll spend playing as one of the two protagonists are "almost equally split", likening the structure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it feels to jump back and forth between them, there's a dichotomy of more traditional horror/fighty bloke action going on. "I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror," Nakanishi explained. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna."</p><p>Taking that metaphor forwards, I assume the monstery things the pair are up against are the dirt and dust we all accrue when we're out and about not playing a horror game. If any other familiar Resi faces show up, will they be filling the role of those little bits of cucumber which get put on the eyes of every person who's every been in an advert for places that boast baths and saunas?</p>
<p>Despite all the relaxing language, Nakanishi made clear that the actiony bits won't be a walk in the park. "The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before", the director said, later adding that the team have build on Kennedy's Resi 4 moveset to mirror how his skills and mindset have evolved since his last appearance. Altogether, Nakanishi reckons the juxtaposition of spooks and shoots will help Requiem deliver "a kind of exhilaration and satisfaction that past Resident Evil titles didn’t offer". </p>
<p>We'll see if that's the case when the Resi spa opens up on February 27th, 2026.</p>
