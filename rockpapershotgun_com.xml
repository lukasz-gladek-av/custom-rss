            <p>Supergiant Games have finally done The Thing, following some patch teases that'd left things in a bit of an '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation">either go or get off the pot' situation</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s full release is nigh, with version 1.0 set to drop later this month.</p>
<p>I'm pleased, because the sequel to the horniest ancient Greek roguelike of all time was already very good in early access form. I'm also terrified, because it's not like September hasn't already had enough games to fight for my attention, between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. I mean, I've not gotten around to playing either of those yet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nba-2k26-review">because basketball</a>, but hey.</p>

<p>Anyway, Hades 2 version 1.0 arrives September 25th, as announced during today's Nintendo Direct. That showcase featured the launch trailer you can check out above, which teases the battle "beyond the underworld" which awaits Melinoë as she continues her war against Chronos, the insufferable time fellow.</p><p>Developers Supergiant have confirmed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520056?l=english">post on Steam</a> that this update'll be free so long as you already own the early access version of the game, while the current price will be staying the same if you're buying for the first time. 1.0 also brings "cross-saves between the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam", if you want to utterly betray your PC roots and build on your progress over on one of the Mario devices.</p>
<p>"Hades II is our team's first-ever sequel, and we've been giving it everything we've got for more than four and a half years," the devs added. "Since May of 2024, we've been developing in Early Access, taking feedback from our player community to try and fully realize this game's potential. The result is the biggest game we've ever made, and one we hope you'll find to be a worthy successor to its namesake."
</p>
<p>Our Brendy wrote the following about Hades 2 when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">reviewed its initial early access version</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote>Roguelikes, I feel, don't suffer as much as other genres from the early access path. The first Hades did it and it quickly became one of our best action games. So, I hereby grant you permission to crack through as much as this follow-up has got to offer, to get briefly obsessed, and then to put it aside for months. The piecemeal, adaptive storytelling is still there too, eschewing anything so simple as the classic three-act structure. Which, for me, makes long absences that much easier to bear. Like the game's own shrouded Narcissus, Hades 2 is already inviting and attractive, even in its unfinished form.</blockquote>
<p>Now, get out of the Melinoë, I've got to go remind myself how to do a Hades so my first version 1.0 run doesn't end in embarrassing fashion after about three rooms. </p>
