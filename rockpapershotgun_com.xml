While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> is obviously quite busy presumably stressing over lukewarm responses to its next game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, they're still working on a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> stuff. The studio revealed a plethora of expansions today, all of which are building up a new "multi-year saga" called the Fate Saga. We'll get to it in a moment, but one of these expansions might raise an eyebrow, as it is quite literally a Star Wars crossover, but is also described by narrative designer Alison Luhrs as one that will push the Fate Saga "forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come."
</p>

<p>
Anyway, let's talk about the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIAAxlbFujk&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2">The Edge of Fate</a>. This one's out quite soon, July 15th, where you'll be heading to a planetoid called Kepler to "redefine our future." You'll be facing off against Fallen Corsairs and Vex Kobolds on Kepler, and you can get new abilities by binding your guardian to dark matter. On top of that, there's a bunch of new modifiers, armour is getting an update to include set bonuses and reworked stats, and gear can progress up to five tiers.

Then, there's the second expansion, Renegades. Here you'll find the Star Wars stuff, which includes you rocking a lightsaber, alongside some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJUdSgTuSMs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous cosmetics</a>. Honestly, this one stinks a bit. I'm a bit sick of Star Wars by now, and I already think that Destiny having any crossovers at all ruins the vibe, but for it to be a whole, important expansion that'll inevitably get vaulted? Come off it. If you're not as put off as I am, this one is due out December 2.

After that there's a couple more expansions to come too, one called Shattered Cycle out summer 2026, and the other being The Alchemist in winter 2026. You might notice that that's two expansions a year, which certainly is a lot, but there's big questions as to whether that'll be enough to bring people back. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has struggled quite a bit in recent years, not to mention the fact that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">down by a lot of staff</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">couple of years ago</a>, so this certainly feels like a push to get back on track. Fingers crossed for the team more than anything else.

I'm a bit of a sucker for weird genre combos. With the amount of games getting released every single day that often combine the same kinds of genres, you start to get hungry for mashups that make you go, "hang on, would that even work?" So when I saw Drop Duchy release yesterday, which mixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris">Tetris</a>, land-grabbing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, deckbuilding and roguelite gameplay, I asked that exact question. Turns out the answer is yes!
</p>

<p>
Here's the lowdown on how Drop Duchy works: like in Tetris and other falling block puzzle games, you have an area where different shaped pieces fall into. You've got your usual shapes, the long one, the L one, the Z one, everyone's played Tetris, you get it. Except each shape represents a piece of land, similar to what you get in something like Civilization. Here you build paths, building upon those with cards from a deck, to slowly build up an area of control that you then have to send troops to battle on against NPCs.

Just combining the strategy, deckbuilding, and roguelite elements doesn't feel all that novel, but there's something about the Tetris nature to it that feels quite whimsical and improvisational. You've really got to think about how you're building up that space in quite a unique way. I'm not even a big strategy game player, I just love Tetris and clever ideas.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's apparently "over 100 unique missions" to make your way through, with three playable factions to choose from. They all come with their own unique quests and rewards too. Just all very neat! And it's got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">10% discount on Steam</a> for the next week or so, best hop on that now.
