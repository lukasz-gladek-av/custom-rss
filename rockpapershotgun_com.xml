            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> you ride a magical blade across shifting dunes of golden sand. It looks like a combination of the jetbike desert-crossing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> and the meditative hiking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a>. Which makes sense when you learn the art director from the latter game is leading the team. I like the look of it. Surfing is cool and so are swords, so I'm happy to see it's coming out in just a couple months, as announced at last night's State of Play show by PlayStation.</p>

<p>It's due out on August 19th this year, say developers Giant Squid. You might know them as the creators of peaceful ocean diving game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abzu">Abzu</a>, or the speedy running and slick archery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>. To my shame I have played neither of these. But then, neither of them has you kickflipping across a mysterious fantasy landscape on a giant medieval weapon. I think maybe this is the one for me, yes.</p>
<p>When the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-new-desert-surfing-adventure-from-the-devs-behind-abzu-and-journey">first announced in 2023</a>, the sword you ride was described as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one". As for the story, it seems as mystical as the game looks.</p>
<p>"You are the Wraith," explained creative director Matt Nava in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-sword-of-the-sea-a-new-game-from-giant-squid/">a blog</a>, "resurrected in a desolate world and tasked with restoring life to it as you explore submerged ruins and the vibrant, varied cultures within. Surf through sinking tombs, mysterious shipwrecks, and petrified battlefields – and bring giant shoals of fish and creatures back in the process. But beware- this land is also home to massive leviathans that will stand in your way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> got a concrete release date at last night's State of Play. You'll be able to play it on PC on September 25 this year, which is also when it arrives on consoles.</p>
<p>As for what you're in for, a fresh trailer made pretty clear that protagonist Hinako Shimizu is going to have a bad time of things, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now">freaky</a> flower monsters and creepy scarecrow-inspired doll things with the mangled posture of your average veteran office worker all seeking to hurt her as she runs around cracking skulls with a pipe.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, things are all fine for Hinako and her mates until a fog decsends on the town of Ebisugaoka, cue a 10/10 creepy laugh and the start of things going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">spookily pear-shaped</a>. Konami producer Motoi Okamoto provided a bit more info in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> released alongside the release date reveal trailer.</p>
<p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town," he wrote, "she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?"</p>
<p>Okamoto cites the game as having "four pillars". These main goals were letting folks explore an "authentic depiction of 1960s Japan", crafting monster design and the soundtrack to focus on the "juxtaposition between beauty and terror", developing puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering", and putting together a "unique" combat system.</p>
<p>"The encounters are as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life," the producer wrote of that last part. "The combat will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>."</p>
<p>The spin-off, penned by Ryukishi07, is designed to work as both an entry point to the series for newbies, and reward veterans with plenty of easter eggs. Last night's showcase also featured the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-is-coming-in-2026-but-once-again-it-looks-like-us-pc-gamers-will-have-to-wait">Nioh 3</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Everyone, stretch your hamstrings. Leg-having simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> got a release date during last night's PlayStation State of Play. As shown in the trailer below, the game is not so much a "walking sim" as a "walking badly sim".

<p>It's due out September 8th, say the developers. Baby Steps was delayed last year, alongside enough other games to warrant a satirical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">"Best Delayed Games" awards show</a> from publishers Devolver. That's okay, it's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games</a> of this year.</p>
<p>You play as Nate, an "unemployed failson" who is one day magically thrust into the wilderness and must learn to use his actual legs to actually walk on the actual ground. What! I could muse about this being a tale of overcoming learned helplessness, or a story about facing down crippling social anxiety, or a comic commentary on humanity's habit of cognitive offloading - giving all mental effort to machinery. But then, I'd be doing the work for you. Just play the game and analyse it yourself, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>Getting Over It was a silly meditation on difficulty and perseverance disguised as a game that streamers would love because it allowed them to scream a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE6Tr5QUeyI">Matt had a go</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwgeFwH9To">I had a go</a>, and then I gave up because I had other things to do and I hate being bad at things. I did not get over it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Horses are overrated. Yeah, I said it. No offence to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">any horse experts</a> out there. They’re a bit of an unnecessary purchase in Elder Scrolls games in my experience. </p>
<p>But how else am I supposed to travel? Ah, of course, by boat. I looked at Nexus Mods this morning and spotted that a modder has saved my poor feet by managing to get fully-functional rowboats working in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, so I can sail around Cyrodiil as a magical mariner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4273?tab=description">Row Your Boat</a> does what it says on the tin, provided you count it as 'rowing' if you're doing it via a spell rather than actual manual labour. Drawing inspiration from some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3575">classic</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6690">Oblivion</a> mods, Tyler ‘Dactyl’ Hallada’s created a means to buy a usable rowboat that you can summon and use to sail the waterways of the Imperial province, merrily waving to all the poor landlubbers you pass and praying that you don’t spring a leak.</p>
<p>As you can see demoed in the showcase video below, the boat’s controlled by casting a special row spell while standing up or crouched to move forwards and backwards, with the direction you’re looking acting as the steering. One you’re up to speed, you can also basically set it in cruise control so it’ll keep carving along while your character’s free to take in the scenery and rest their arms.</p>

<p>Hallada’s implemented stuff like “dynamic collision detection” and “realistic wave simulation” to make things feel more authentically boaty, and added a handy in-game manual in case you get stuck. You can also purchase upgrades for the boat, in the form of a storage chest, working lamp, and a rope ladder to make boarding easier.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the mod’s pretty hardware-intensive right now, with its creator writing: “You may experience some performance impact, especially with a weak CPU. This mod is pushing the limits of the script engine. I’ve spent a lot of time to reduce the performance impact and minimise script execution when the boat is not in use. I personally don’t notice an FPS impact but your mileage may vary.” There's also a list of known issues on the mod page that's worth scanning through.</p>
<p>If you fancy taking to the seas, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's coming out February 24th next year. The ocean-exploring game is set on a flooded earth on which "deadly plastification threatens to kill all living things". It mostly looks like an adventure of gathering resources, meeting strange new folk, and possibly killing them. </p>
<p>The catch is that you're always following in the wake of another player, whose own choices colour how people will react to you. In the trailer above we see Souls-esque phantoms of other adventurers affecting the player's world. They might have taken some loot you wanted, or maybe they threw a dude into the toxic water and now you've got to deal with the poor sick fella afterwards. It's basically a "choices matter" game, but someone else is doing the choosing. That said, other players may also be following you.</p>
<p>"Each person who plays is recorded, their choices are saved, and you can follow them along your journey! A friend? A streamer? The choice is yours!" say developers Digixart. "You will feel the impact from the consequences of the one you follow and must deal with them! It’s up to you to cooperate... or to make some waves!"</p>
<p>Okay, calm down please, marketing copy. No need for all those exclams. Anyway, there were a lot of choices to make in Road 96 too, the previous singleplayer game by Digixart. It was well-liked by Alice B (RPS in peace). "This political road trip is rendered an exciting and entertaining time by its cast and the deliberately piecemeal nature of its storytelling, rather than the story itself," she said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/road-96-review">her review</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I haven't yet decided whether the loot tortoise in roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dice-legends">Dice Legends</a> looks satisfied or exhausted. Both make sense to me. "He's grown used to this, but still isn't thrilled about it," offered my sister. I would not be thrilled either. Imagine being aware of Pratchett's world turtle and knowing you're a glorified ATM by comparison.</p>
<p>"A roguelike deckbuilder, Nic?", you exclaim with mock interest. "Well, kick me down a well and break out the Vimto we've had mouldering in the cellar since the nineties, the last decade in which anyone consumed or thought about Vimto. Haven't had one of those since the time I went to collect the post forty five seconds ago. Also, the post was two flyers, each advertising a roguelike deckbuilder". I will not argue with your sage industry analysis, friend, although this one does have a couple of notables that may make the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112170/Dice_Legends/">Steam demo</a> an intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>It's got lovely pixel art, for one, although thoughtful art direction isn't too surprising. Dice Legends is the latest project from CD Project alum Rafał Jaki, co-creator of The Witcher 3's Gwent minigame and showrunner on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>It's also got a tabletop twist on traditional card flinging. Each of the three playable heroes uses a different type of dice (D6, D8, or the haughty D12 - also known in some circles as 'the shape bastard'), and you'll use these to roll a dice pool to activate cards. Some cards need a number within a certain range but will still have the same effect. Others scale up with your dice results. Otherwise, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at its very core. Attack, build up shield to defend against telegraphed damage, apply debuffs, and conquer nodes on an overworld map.</p>
<p>Additionally, the soundtrack is pure Bardcore. It is certified <em>jaunty</em> up in here. Is Dice Legends a 'fifth page on the Nintendo Eshop sale'-ass name for a game? Yes. But I think it's good time nonetheless. This one's out in the third quarter of the year, to use the language of my most hated enemies, the year quarterers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
