            <p>Indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game developer Ruled are onto a nice little spree with their shortform Itch.io releases - seemingly, they are skipping from phobia to phobia. First there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/automatonophobia">Automatonophobia</a>, a game that navigated the fear of subterranean golems, then there was <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/chrometophobia">Chrometophobia</a>, a game dedicated to the fear of spending money, and also to the act of finding "grimbo" gibs for a delicious pie. What's next on the menu? Ah yes, scarecrows. </p><!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://ruleddev.itch.io/formidophobia">Formidophobia</a>, which can be downloaded for free, you are a farmer trying to make it across a hazy lofi cornfield. Your dad told you never to go in that field. His dad told him never to go in that field. Neither of them are around anymore, however, and your wife needs medical attention, so off you trot with your bolt-action rifle and exactly one shell. With luck, you'll find more shells along the way.</p>
<p>The rifle is a stubborn, slothful broomhandle of a weapon that wobbles drunkenly at stomach level and often gets caught on other objects, dragging behind you in a way that makes me empathise for the weary arms of my character. The principal challenge and source of dread in Formidophobia is reloading it in a punctual fashion.</p>
<p>The starting area is a ring of scrawly signposts that illustrate the process of pulling back the lever, tugging a shell from the holder, and closing the gun up again. The utility of those signposts isn't that they tell you how to wield your gun, in my experience - it's that other things can't walk through them.</p>
<p>I enjoy the grubbiness, stodginess and overall inhospitability of this game. Don't come expecting "polish", do come expecting a briskly unpleasant meditation on the rasp of stems and the crickle-crackle of bones, deep in the mist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While the prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> turning out to be a real thing had folks wondering what that might mean for Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">release</a>, Bethesda were quick quell fears of a shutdown.</p>
<p>Both sides have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">openly chummy</a> since that point, with the studio behind The Elder Scrolls even having the team of modders pop by for a visit around the time their project was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-so-chill-about-skyblivion-that-theyre-promoting-it-in-oblivion-remastered-videos">shouted out on the official channels</a>. We've now learned a bit more about how that social call went and what the two sides chatted about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/we-just-kept-geeking-out-skyblivion-devs-were-invited-to-bethesda-hq-and-ended-up-spending-the-whole-day-talking-about-modding-with-the-team-and-todd-howard/">PC Gamer</a>, Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel revealed that the studio visit came about because he'd been planning a trip to the US around PAX East, and decided that since he was going to be in the area, he'd ring up Bethesda and see if they'd mind Skyblivion folks popping in.</p>
<p>Cue a day at ToddCo HQ that the modder recalled ran from 11AM until 6PM, with Bethesda's devs and Todd Howard himself chatting to the Skyblivion folks about their work. Naturally, it sounds like the studio's devs were curious about how the modders have found building their own interpretation of Oblivion using <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s tools, with Rebel saying that "how we experienced using those tools, what kind of issues we run into, and what we'd like to see in terms of documentation" were all big talking points.</p>
<p>As for the feedback the Skyblivion folks offered, the project lead said he kindly asked Bethesda to consider bringing back the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKivlGmia4">official creation kit tutorial video series</a> it released on YouTube when Skyrim got its tools. If you've not watched these vids, they're basically short how-tos narrated by different Bethesda devs that explain the ins-and-outs of the modding process.</p>
<p>A way to get started with Skyrim modding using the CK by making a basic dungeon, if - as I was when I used these videos for exactly that last year - you don't know your bum from your elbow when it comes to actually making mods or the navigating the practicalities of game development.</p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of good tutorials you can find if you're looking to get into modding more recent Bethesda games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, with some even being by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k9iRuLqwoY">high-profile modders</a>, but it's cool to have the devs who made the thing you've been playing talk you through the tools they used to do so. They're pretty good teachers, and it gives you an extra level of appreciation the next time you delve into one of Skyrim's dungeons. You'll know just how much work went to ensuring the enemies don't all get stuck on the same rock and eliminating void-leaking gaps in the ceiling, and it'll be good for your soul.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood-message">Blood Message</a> is a new singleplayer third-person action game from NetEase, publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/naraka-bladepoint">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>. It follows the journey of a “nameless messenger” and his son across Tang dynasty China, and is laced with the “customs, culture, and rich history of the era”. Amongst other sights and sounds, you will join an uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang and tread the legendary Silk Road trade routes as you “etch a final tale of loyalty” into the helpless, screaming face of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>I know absolutely nothing about any of these historical and cultural precedents, so I will frame things in terms of the mechanics and skits I recognise from opulent manly bonkfests like God Of War. You will: shimmy through narrow gaps, presumably so that the next area has time to load! Lift a huge sliding door so that your AI-controlled partner can scamper under it, bookending your progress! Mash somebody’s mug into the woodwork while performing an environmental finisher! Topple over and slide uncontrollably through collapsing scenery! Remorselessly QTE a cartwheel while trapped beneath the speeding vehicle! There, now - between those two paragraphs, you don’t even <em>need</em> to watch the following trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's end-of-day Friday and I am probably being too pissy. Yes, this appears to be another vibrantly violent canyon of exploding or murdersome photoreal furniture, but there is a lot of (romanticised?) history here I wouldn’t mind encountering up close.</p>
<p>I just hope it manages to have a sense of humour about itself, somewhere. NetEase don’t give that impression in their announcement release. “How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history?” it brays. “The Blood Message development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.” Nice to hear, because the monuments in the trailer don’t seem very eternal: it’s like the masonry is mortared with anti-matter.</p>
<p>Lead producer and NetEase executive vice president Zhipeng Hu adds that this is the “first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games”. They are certainly making no bones of the genre markers they're trying to hit with that video. There’s no release date yet. Learn more on <a href="https://www.blood-message.com/">the official site</a> (which, be warned, is hella animation-heavy and may devour your mobile data allowance in one fell swoop).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
