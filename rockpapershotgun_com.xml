The international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement are calling on people to cancel Game Pass subscriptions, avoid Microsoft-owned video game properties such as Minecraft and Call Of Duty, and boycott all Microsoft Gaming and Xbox-branded products in protest at the company’s reported business connections with the Israeli military.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The call follows allegations this January about the Israeli military’s usage of Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology and artificial intelligence products in the course of its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. 
</p>
<p>
According to a joint investigation between the Guardian, Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, with additional reporting from Drop Site News, Microsoft have “deepened” their relationship with Israel’s defence establishment since 7th October 2023, when several Palestinian militant groups struck across the border and massacred over a thousand people. Israel responded to the attack by mounting a ground offensive and airstrikes that have destroyed much of Gaza and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
</p>
<p>
In their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft">January 2025 write-up</a>, the Guardian claim that Microsoft have supplied the Israeli Defense Forces with storage and computing services and struck “at least $10m in deals to provide thousands of hours of technical support”. The piece continues that “while the IDF has used some Microsoft services for administrative purposes, such as email and file management systems, documents and interviews suggest Azure has been used to support combat and intelligence activities.”
</p>
<p>
The joint investigation alleges the use of Microsoft technology by Israeli security forces to manage the population registry and movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. It further claims that Microsoft have supplied a “suite of communications and messaging systems” for managing databanks of potential airstrike targets. Microsoft have also reportedly given the Israeli military “large-scale access” to OpenAI’s GPT-4 “in recent years”.
</p>
<p>
Neither the Israeli military nor Microsoft commented on the Guardian report at the time of its publication. 
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft">Drop Site</a>, two former Microsoft employees, Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr, have been instrumental in driving this week’s BDS call for a boycott of Microsoft’s gaming offerings. As reported by the Guardian, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired the pair in October 2024</a> after they organised a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza outside the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time BDS have protested Microsoft's alleged connections to Israeli military or security organisations. In 2020, they and other civil liberty groups <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/bds-win-microsoft-drops-anyvision">spoke out</a> against Microsoft's stake in AnyVision, an Israeli start-up whose face recognition technology has been used at checkpoints in border crossings between Israel and the West Bank. Microsoft later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/microsoft-to-divest-anyvision-stake-end-face-recognition-investing-idUSKBN21E3BA/">sold their stake</a> and announced that they would exit the business of investing in facial recognition startups altogether.</p>
<p>BDS are now making the games publisher a “priority target” in response to this January's allegations. You can read more about the boycott over on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">the BDS website</a>. I've asked Microsoft for comment.

Eremite Studios and Hooded Horse’s bestest best city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a> is getting a free update and a new paid expansion, featuring a new biome, mechanics and faction. Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

            <p>FromSoftware boss and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">treacherous moon denier</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki has emerged from his Nintendo-nuzzling weasel den to reassure the braying masses that FromSoftware's traditional focus on single player games isn't going dodo just because they so happened to announce two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods - in the space of five minutes, then ran away with a bag of money shouting "single player is dead 4eva". What a tremendous relief.</p>

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
