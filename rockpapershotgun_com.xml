            <p>Here's one for the sci-fi slurping doomers among us. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hello-sunshine">Hello Sunshine</a> is a "survival mystery RPG" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/draugen">Draugen</a>, in which you must navigate a blistering desert by sheltering in the constantly moving shadow of a friendly robot. A collapsed corporation called Sunshine has turned the planet into a scorched wasteland leaving behind only warring mechs and dusty vending machines. "You play the final employee," say developers Red Thread Games. "Walk in the shadow of a giant robot during the sweltering days; stay close to keep warm during the cold nights." I wonder if any of this is a metaphor. Ah, who cares, it's got a cool trailer.</p>

<p>You're trying to reach a distant tower, where you'll "help decide the fate of what remains of this world." But to get there you have to take advantage of your big metal friend's shadow to survive the otherwise skin-frying sun rays. Along the way you'll scavenge food, salvage mechanical bits 'n' bobs, upgrade your big bot, and deploy smaller drones to help map the surroundings and gather useful gear. When night falls the temperature plummets and you'll have to snuggle up to the robot, where you can cook food and tinker with equipment. </p>
<p>"At first, the colossus barely acknowledges you," says the blurb on the game's Steam page. "Over time, your bond strengthens. Assist the robot with repairs, install upgrades, and unlock new ways to interact. In return, the metal giant will aid you on your journey — locating secrets hidden in the desert, lifting you past obstacles, shielding you from threats, fighting back against hostile war machines."</p>
<p>You'll also be able to give your post-apocalyptic pal a paint job, and add decals to his shiny metal chassis. Interestingly, it looks like there'll be a co-op mode too, which seems to pit one player as the human and another as the sand-stomping big lad.</p>
<p>"Team up with a friend (or workmate) to experience the journey from different perspectives," say the devs. "Coordinate scavenging runs, trade resources, and explore how your peculiar partnership shapes the unfolding narrative."</p>
<p>Red Thread Games previously made road trip adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dustborn">Dustborn</a>, which saw a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dustborn-is-the-latest-addition-to-the-nascent-misfits-on-a-road-trip-genre">misfits crossing a dystopian United States</a> with a comic-booky "words are magic" schtick. Before that they made first-person mystery Draugen, in which you explored an abandoned Norwegian village called Graavik for clues about your missing sister. Alice B (RPS in peace) thought it was OK. "Draugen does a lot of tropes very well," she said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/draugen-review">in her review</a>, "but it does others in a tired way that garners side eye from me... Graavik, meanwhile, remains a nice place to visit. But you wouldn’t want to live there."</p>
<p>Hello Sunshine doesn't have a release date yet. It's only listed as "coming soon". We'll let you know when more information comes trudging over the horizon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> hath been Patched, Adorning the Right Goode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with the Wondrous Art of Barbering and the Dark Science of Steamworks Modding, together with Sundry Fixes for Quests, Crashing and Performance Problems, Skills and NPC Behavioure. Yes, I'm aware the previous sentence can't work out which century it's in. In a perfect world I'd have had the time to dig out a medieval dictionary and translate this introduction into proper 14th century English. As it is, you'll have to make do with the one middle English word I can reliably remember from university: ywys! It means "indeed". This latest Deliverance 2 update? A mighty addition, ywys.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The full patch notes are <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">here</a>. Be warned that they are long. Easily as long as The Canterbury Tales, and almost as exciting, because while The Canterbury Tales has more scenes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller's_Tale">paramours accidentally kissing their beloved's hairy bottoms</a>, the Deliverance 2 patch notes have Chaucer beat in terms of minutiae such as "improved physics of the parsnip". Here are a few other tweaks I enjoyed: "Shops no longer sell cobwebs"; "fixed looped drinking sound after being killed when drinking"; "fixed raining inside of a barn in Zhelejov"; "fixed the issue where a civilian would not stop banishing the player's horse".
</p>
<p>
As for the new features: you'll find the above-mentioned barbers across Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. They operate out of festive white tents, and offer a range of period-appropriate makeovers. No textured drop fades, I think. The patch notes also make mention of some significant tune-ups for the pickpockets and cat burglars amongst you: Warhorse have "created new clothing and equipment specifically supporting stealth gameplay and rebalanced stealth stats for all clothing".  That said, "stealth kills are now more likely to fail", and people now scream when they're stealth-killed. 
</p>
<p>
I don't think I ever did any stealthing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 unless required to by a quest. I had my heart set on being an upstanding citizen who improves his prospects by way of honest industry and charisma. Being nudged to "break playstyle" by a quest is one of the chief criticisms in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, incidentally. Still, I'm happy that the shadow-hugging blaggards amongst you are getting some love.</p>
<p>Are you still playing KCD2, or have the draconic wiles of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> lured you away from rustic Bohemia? KCD2 does have "dragon bones", it must be said, though I've yet to work out whether they're from an actual dragon, or what they're even for beyond tantalising the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> players.
