            <p>Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turok-origins">Turok: Origins</a> will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it'll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.</p>

<p>There'll be a lot of melee attacking by the looks of things, but a shootybang is a shootybang. Players are promised "plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more" , while the DNA powers will supplement that combat (one power looks like a time-freezing bubble). There's also a story to follow, somewhere, but we're not told what it's about yet. Only that it is "epic" and will see the warriors visit lots of fancy locations "from ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles".</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the series has been revived. A reboot simply titled Turok came out in 2008 to mixed reviews. It sold well enough for developers at Propaganda Games to start work on a sequel, but not well enough to prevent its sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-throws-turok-sequel-in-the-bin">being cancelled the following year</a>, resulting in 70 redundancies at the studio. How times change, eh? We'd never see ruthless layoffs like that today!</p><p>Anyway. It's being made by Saber Interactive, the many-studio'd publishers who specialise in working on licensed properties, and a relatively safe pair of hands. They did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>, among others. Saber are also working on another dinosaur game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, which looks less violent toward the beautiful creatures and therefore morally more forgivable.</p>
<p>If I am cranky about the jungly shooter, please forgive me. It was shown off at The Game Awards, which aired in the early hours of this morning and has claimed all my Rock Paper Brethren, leaving only two survivors: me and guides guru Jeremy. The team was up posting much of the news, and before Ollie expired from a chronic case of video games, he wrote up a huge summary post of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">all the games revealed at the Game Awards 2024</a>. That's massively handy, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and at the same time a trailer dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-character-will-be-revealed-this-week-and-clues-point-to-a-certain-lady-in-red">a big unmistakable hint</a> for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night's Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>? Sure. Why not.</p>

<p>Ah yes, lots of swooshy fire and ice effects alongside those jabs and slices, as befits the magic man. This is the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> character to guest star in the fighter in recent times, as Noctis from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a> also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noct-out-with-a-fish-my-quest-to-k-o-someone-in-tekken-with-a-tuna">found his fishy way into the Iron Fist Tournament</a> back in 2018. Some of Clive's warpy movement is reminiscent of the road tripping prince (one air-blipping combo in particular) but most of the moveset looks to be his own angry bashing. At one point he slashes Zantetsuken-style in the manner of Odin, long-standing summon of the RPG series, and for the finale he conjures Ifrit into being for what looks to be the character's Rage art. </p>
<p>He's the fourth and final character for anyone who bought the season 1 DLC pass, standing alongside the already-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-first-dlc-character-will-be-series-regular-eddy-gordo-kicking-off-its-season-pass-this-spring">Eddy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wapN3UqjJmI">Lidia</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heihachi-rises-from-the-dead-as-tekken-8s-third-character-dlc">Heihachi</a>. His fiery Phoenix Gate stage also comes included. There will be some disappointment, I'm sure, given how some fans have been clamouring for years to see Tifa - another Final Fantasy character - included as a guest (or Kiryu from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza">Yakuza</a> series). Once again they haven't seen their prayers answered, but perhaps the sting will fade when they inspect Clive's moveset. Some of his attacks look frighteningly fast. He's getting added to the game next week, December 16th.</p><p>As for my earlier reporting that the new character would likely be the bifferess in red, well, I got confused. Those hints were intended for the <em>next</em> season of the fighting game, suggesting that Anna is coming next year (Anna has been a mainstay in all Tekken games, apart from Tekken 4 for some reason). It serves me right for getting caught up in the prevailing winds of streamer opinion and the YouTube commentariat, instead of trusting my newsboi gut and simply saying in a boring voice: "we don't know who this will be yet." To be honest, I'm just upset we haven't yet seen any sign of drunken master Lei or irritable matador Miguel. Although, now that I look at Clive's hair, there is something distinctly Miguelish about him. Maybe I can dress him up?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
