            <p>Ye gads, there’s three of them. You <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-valves-forty-majillion-secret-hardware-projects-is-called-the-steam-frame-probably">may have heard</a> that a Valve hardware announcement was on the cards, but the Steam custodians’ biggest  metal-and-circuits reveal since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> actually concerns a power trio: a new Steam Machine, a new Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame hybrid VR headset. They're all official, and all coming (pricing and exact dates TBA) in early 2026.</p>
<p>I’ve had some quality hands-on time with them myself, having been mysteriously summoned to Valve HQ late last month (flying/accommodating on our own dime, before anyone gets clever). Full thoughts can be found in the links below, and I’ll say this up front: all three have a clear Steam Deck influence, be it the design language, the value of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-proton-the-reason-most-steam-deck-games-work-has-a-version-100-beta-to-try">Proton</a>-aided game compatibility, or simply the pleasure of a quality thumbstick. If you liked the handheld then... well, you might not <em>necessarily</em> like the Steam Machine, Controller, or Frame, but you’ll have already read the shorthand on where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more features and insights coming later today and this week, based on interviews with Valve’s in-house designers and engineers. In the meantime, let’s do some specs lists here as well. Why not, eh. The Steam Machine is set to be Valve’s most powerful in-house hardware piece thus far, leaning on a discrete AMD GPU to run modern games at upscaled 4K, while the redesigned Steam Controller sacrifices some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goodnight-sweet-steam-controller">original model’s idiosyncrasies</a> in pursuit of better all-roundedness. The Steam Frame is perhaps both the most ambitious and the riskiest: its modular design, groundbreaking support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">Steam games on ARM hardware</a>, and combination of quality PC VR with standalone headset play all show great promise, but not the kind that seemed imminently fulfillable at the time of my preview session.</p>
<h3>Steam Machine (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> 6-core AMD Zen 4</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Semi-custom AMD RDNA 3 with 28 Compute Units, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</li>

<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 512GB or 2TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 2x USB3, 2x USB2, 1x USB Type C, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x Ethernet</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, integrated Steam Controller receiver</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Controller (2026) specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thumbsticks:</strong> 2x TMR magnetic thumbsticks</li>
<li><strong>Trackpads:</strong> 2x capacitive trackpads with haptics</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz (over Steam Controller Puck), Bluetooth, USB</li>

<li><strong>Battery life:</strong> 35h</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> SteamOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Ios/Android with Steam Link</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steam Frame specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SoC:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>Lenses:</strong> Pancake optics, LCD, 2160x2160 per eye</li>
<li><strong>Field of View:</strong> 110 degrees</li>
<li><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 72-120Hz (144Hz in Experimental mode)</li>
<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> 4x external cameras for controller and headset tracking, 2x interior cameras for eye tracking</li>
<li><strong>Audio:</strong> Dual speaker drivers (per ear), integrated into headstrap</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> 256GB or 1TB</li>
<li><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x microSD, 1x PCIe expansion port with camera passthrough</li>
<li><strong>Wireless:</strong> Dual Wi-Fi 7/Wi-Fi 6E </li>
<li><strong>Battery:</strong> Rechageable 21.6Whr Li-On</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS</li>
<li><strong>Controllers:</strong> Full 6-DOF tracking and IMU support, traditional gamepad inputs, capacitive finger tracking, haptic feedback, AA batteries (40h life)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there’s no concrete release date or pricing for these yet, though Valve engineer Jeremy Selan told me that the while the Steam Frame specifically would be a "premium" VR headset. it'll still likely be priced "less than [the] Index." That's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> headset, the full kit of which remains at the same £919 / $999 pricepoint it launched at in 2019. We'll report any further details ahead of release next year.</p>

            <p>
With as young a medium as games is (and it is young, as old as we all might feel), it's no surprise that it would burgeon new genres, and that said genres would be called into question. Metroidvanias! That's a potentially silly one, with a common argument being that it tells you nothing about the genre itself. I prefer Japan's search action as a name myself, though I am but one humble games journalist. A genre I hadn't called into question until today, however, is extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, a name that a former Bungie lead apparently disliked so much he tried to get the studio's marketing team to make something else up for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Bungie lead in question is the developer's former director of product management Chris Sides, who left the studio last year. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqwje5N5ArA">Shooter Monthly</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/">TheGamePost</a>) of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, Sides said that "The problem is, Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it’s not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name,' because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic."
</p>
<p>
Sides called into question as to whether or not Helldivers 2 is an extraction shooter simply because you can extract, arguing that it's not because it's not like, as an example, Escape From Tarkov. "So, the terminology of the genre is already terrible; it really makes it hard to compare these games," Sides said.
</p>
<p>
I think that Sides is right to frame it in terms of a marketing perspective, because I think within the world of games genre is much more about selling a game than it is about denoting a particular expectation of it. A good film marketer does not sell one solely based on its combination of genres, yet games marketing does this frequently; I'm so glad you made a roguelike deckbuilder, but what is it actually about? Hit me with that first!
</p><p>
That's kind of the real issue, that marketing is incredibly genre-forward, and part of why I think Marathon has struggled to find an identity. Sure, I understand the basic principle of the thing I am doing in Marathon, I want to be given a stronger reason as to why I'm doing it, and to feel some of what Bungie can do so well, their social elements. If we're thinking about marketing, we first need to be thinking about what makes the game special! That's a better place to start than fixating on a genre that is still in the midst of figuring itself out, if you ask me.
