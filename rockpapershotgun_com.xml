        <p>Guess the leakers were in a rush to show it off</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Yes, yes, you're reading that headline right. Yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> leak has taken place, if you can believe it, showing 15 whole minutes of the game that we all know exists but hasn't really been shown off in an official capacity. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leak in March</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">even just last week</a>, which might have confirmed the presence of a battle royale mode. This latest leak offers something new though: the return of Rush mode, a mode that's appeared in a number of previous Battlefield entries.
</p>
<p>
The footage in question, which originated from the Chinese social media site bilibili, keeps getting taken down given that this is very obviously meant to be under NDA and not something the general public is meant to see. So, I'm not going to link to it anywhere, because inevitably whatever clip I do share here will be gone by the time I wake up tomorrow (here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">link to a Reddit page</a> where the footage was available at one point, just for some amount of evidence). The footage in question shows off pretty much what you'd expect from a Battlefield game, i.e. unrealistic combat scenarios, destructible environments, commentary from gamers getting annoyed at other people but truthfully more at themselves due to their inner turmoil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how this version of Rush might be different from previous incarnations, I honestly can't say. I've not played any Battlefield games, it all just looks like your typical military <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> to me. From what I can tell a majority of the footage is from the perspective of the attacking team - Rush generally sees a team of attackers, who have a limited number of respawns, go against defenders, who have an unlimited number of respawns, the former trying to detonate two charges in the latter's base.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that this is all a work in progress, some of the vehicles aren't finished for example, and there's always the chance the mode doesn't make it into the full release. In any case, this is your regular reminder that NDAs will never stop gamers from sharing clips online.

            <p>
You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-terraria-collab-is-coming-this-summer-though-i-have-some-questions-about-it">put the Terraria in Palworld</a>, but can you put the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>? Well, uh, yes, apparently. Earlier this week Palworld's Tides of Terraria update was released unto the world, adding in things like fishing, a new trust mechanic, and obviously some Terraria themed bits like monsters to fight and items to get. Now, in a <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-june-2025.143573/#tmod">post shared on the Terraria forums</a>, a new look at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's next update, version 1.4.5, showed off its own Palworld update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I should note that not much was shown off from the Palworld additions, but it was confirmed to be arriving with the next update. A GIF was also included in the post showing a new pet companion, Digtoise, a Pal that looks as if Blastoise and Bowser had a baby. Digtoise can, as its name suggests, can dig into the ground, adding blocks of dirt and presumably other materials to your inventory. 
</p>
<p>
The forum post also notes that the team is "working in secret to bring some of your favorite Pals to life in the world of Terraria! What other Pals might appear? What other Palworld content might you see? Who knows?" I'm assuming they know at the very least!
</p>
<p>
In terms of non-Palworld related things coming in the update, there's some new furniture sets coming, notably some fancy ones. Nothing that exciting, but more stuff is more stuff.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, the post made one other thing clear: "we still do not have a release date to give out. Every day is one day closer, of course, but we are trying to remain overly cautious and conservative in regards to giving out any timing. We do not want to repeat the mistake of giving out a timing window and then have things change and it not be accurate. So, we must once again ask for your continued patience as we do the hard work that needs to be done in order to ensure a quality update for everyone."
</p>
<p>
It also notes that everything is moving along as fast as it can without making the team crunch on it, but completely ruled that out, which is a refreshing thing to hear at this point honestly. I'm sure it'll be ready when it's ready!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a> are a developer who more likely than not, you'll think of as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting</a> game studio. I wouldn't blame you, they're the folks behind Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Persona 4 Arena, all really beloved fighting games. That doesn't paint a full picture though, and in a showcase held yesterday, they showed off a bunch of upcoming games, some of which they made themselves, others they're serving as publisher for. And not one fighting game in sight! Which plenty of people made comments about, but I think those people maybe need to play anything other than a fighting game for once.
</p>

<p>
First up is possibly the most exciting announcement of the bunch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt4ojxXBIck">Dear me, I was</a>, a dialogueless interactive adventure game that unfortunately isn't coming to PC but I need to make mention of. That's because Taisuke Kanasaki, the director and artist of Hotel Dusk and Another Code, is serving as art director on this project, with Maho Taguchi serving as director. Kanasaki's art is instantly recogniseable, so I've got my fingers tightly crossed it'll make its way to PC.

<p>
There was also a showcase for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyhbM6DtET8">Double Dragon Revive</a>, a new take on the classic side-scrolling beat-em-up, which is coming to PC for those looking for a dose of nostalgia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv5WxE-kLGM">Demon's Night Fever</a> is a currently platformless new stylish seeming "raising speedrun simulation RPG based on the concept of 'embrace being evil'" from Disgaea creator Sohei Niikawa. Kind of obsessed with whatever that explanation is, also hoping this one comes to PC. And there's a new Bubble Bobble called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2937770/Bubble_Bobble_Sugar_Dungeons/">Sugar Dungeons</a>! Can't go wrong there, and this one is coming to PC. All of these are being published by Arc System Works.
</p>
<p>
Then, lastly, there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2ZvFP36M0">Damon and Baby</a>, an isometric action game where you play as a Demon King who's been cursed to be stuck to a human child, which Arc System Works is developing. Not much of this one was shown off, and again, no platforms were confirmed for this one, but it's how Guilty Gear creator Daisuke Ishiwatari introduced it that I think is worth highlighting.
</p>
<p>
Right off the bat he noted how the "game market is tough now. To overcome that, Arc System Works has launched a new project." He goes on to say how he knows that most people recognise the studio as a fighting game company, but to "achieve a new brand where we are known for quality mid-range action games, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games."
</p>
<p>
He notes how because of the fact that both ends of the AAA blockbuster and indie spectrum can find a lot of success, there's more risk for companies to create new series. "This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future, a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes, and to accumulate technology and know-how."
</p>
<p>
Ishiwatari points out how Guilty Gear started out as a small-scale project, and has gone on to be a much bigger series. So he hopes that by making more mid-range titles, there'll be more opportunities for many more games and creators of games.
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, hearing something like this is a breath of fresh air. I love an indie game, and I can enjoy the odd AAA title, but nothing gets me going like a mid-range, AA game (looking at you, Remedy). More importantly, attempting to create an environment where younger developers can learn and improve their skills to perhaps one day make something bigger and bolder is ridiculously needed. 
</p>
<p>
With all of the layoffs that have taken place, there's so many skilled developers being forcefully ousted, leaving little room for junior staff members to come in and work their way up. I've got my fingers crossed for Arc System Works' initiative, and hope to see more of it from other studios too.
