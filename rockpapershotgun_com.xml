You know, at this point I'm not sure if games, or even just aspects of games, that rely on licensing other works, is really all that good of an idea. It's probably part of why there are some Fortnite skins you never see in the shop anymore, it's absolutely why the Friday the 13th game shut down, and I have a hunch that that's what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>. Recently, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game disappeared from both the PlayStation Store and Epic Games Store, leading to a bit of confusion as to its status. Now, the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> have put out a comment addressing the situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," wrote Saber in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam post</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
My guess is that despite only being a three year old game, it hasn't done well enough to keep it going, and something related to licensing out the Evil Dead universe has fallen through. I honestly can't tell you, and I doubt Saber will confirm anything, so your guess is as good as mine. None of this is surprising though, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-dead-the-game-studio-halts-development-of-new-content-just-16-months-after-launch-but-servers-will-stay-up-for-now">new content for the game was stopped back in 2023</a>, only 16 months after the game launched.
</p>
<p>
The fact that servers are still being kept online is a welcome surprise, but ultimately the game's death warrant has been signed. Obviously the irony of a game with the word dead in its title dying like this isn't lost on me. You don't need to post your witty "Evil Dead game" comments, I'm one step ahead of you.

I really quite like how simple a title <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratopia">Ratopia</a> has. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategic</a> survival city builder, where you have to build a nice place for rats to live. Ratopia! It gets straight to the heart of it, and it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2244130/view/538852710067208196?l=english">just received its 1.0 release today</a> after an early access period of 18 months. The game has had a lengthy development time too, starting way back in 2020, and in a Steam post discussing the 1.0 release, developers Cassel Games left a nice and lengthy list covering everything that's been added across its early access release.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That includes things like a diplomacy system, character customisation, even a disease system, which does make me sad, but rats are generally known for being carriers of all sorts. In terms of gameplay, there's definitely a bit of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> vibe to it given that your rats walk around 2D landscapes, digging at squares to build settlements. All the rats apparently have their "own wealth and unique characteristics", though, I have to say, developing capitalism but for rats doesn't seem very utopic.

<p>
This 1.0 update also adds in a new leader perk system, which offers, you guessed it, perks for your leader rat. That can be for things like recovering health at certain times of day, or to help you cultivate plants. Those that like to tweak their challenge to suit them have some new options to tweak things like choosing which kinds of enemies invade, changing the season order, or just outright turning crime off. There's the utopia I'm looking for!
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more than that too, and Cassel Games did say that they plan to release more updates in the future too, as well as Steam Deck improvements. It's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244130/Ratopia/">currently 20% off</a>, which technically is just keeping it at it's early access price more or less, so you've got until May 14th to get it slightly cheaper than you will pass that point. Oh, and there's a demo too! Lots of options for you.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> has fallen from grace a touch, it seems. The dress-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> arrived on Steam last week, almost five months since it launched on the Epic Games Store, but it did so with quite a few caveats. For starters, the game's latest update 1.5 arrived around the same time, leading to a plethora of issues with the game, quite notably frequent crashes. Then there's also been a large number of Chinese players expressing their frustration with some of the changes on the game's Steam forusm, namely the increase in cost of banners. This has led to the game hitting a Mixed rating on Steam, so the game's dev has come out with a big ole apology literally asking for "one more chance."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The apology was shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikkiofficial/comments/1karmi3/apology_letter_regarding_version_15_gaming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">official Infinity Nikki subreddit</a>, where the devs admitted to falling "short of expectations. Following the version update, we received a lot of feedback regarding game experience issues, primarily concerning the DIY Workshop, co-op feature, and overall game performance, including issues such as login failures, crashes, and resolution problems."
</p>
<p>
However, on that point of the cost of banners, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/papergames">Papergames</a> didn't seem quite so willing to make a change. You see, some new five-star outfits now cost 11 pieces, where they'd either been nine or ten before, making the odds to pull them a lot harder. 
</p>
<p>
Papergames tried to justify this by saying they "introduced highly dynamic special effects for the pieces and special aurora effects for the hair" with these new banners, apologising for the "lack of prior communication regarding this adjustment," and promising that the number of pieces in five-star outfits is guaranteed not to exceed 11. A noticeable lack of saying "yeah we're not going to make them cost that much anymore" for my liking.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Papergames have been a touch shaken by this response given that they also asked everyone to "Please give us one more chance - to let Nikki's starlight continue to shine for us all, and to keep the warmth in our hearts forever burning bright." At least they're keeping their copy consistent.
