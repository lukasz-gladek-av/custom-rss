            <p>In the aftermath of reports claiming that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) deepened their reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement demanding the company cut ties with the agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> are the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">worker-led group</a> who've carried out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">protests</a> against Microsoft's dealings with the Israeli military, amid what Amnesty International and a UN enquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/israel-still-committing-genocide-in-gaza-amnesty-international-says">have called</a> a genocide in Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to reporting from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/ice-microsoft-technology-immigration-crackdown">The Guardian</a> and partner publications <a href="https://www.972mag.com/ice-microsoft-azure-leaked-files/">+972 Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/">Local Call</a> earlier this week, leaked documents indicate that ICE increased the amount of data it stored on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform from from 400 terabytes as of July 2025 to almost 1,400 terabytes as of January 2026. The agency are also reportedly using Microsoft "productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data".</p>
<p>In a statement to The Guardian, a Microsoft spokesperson said that while they do "[provide] cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE" via "key partners", the company's policies and terms of service "do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity".</p><p>Following this reporting, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsofts-ties-with-ice-come-under-fire-amidst-allegations-that-the-companys-cloud-and-ai-technology-are-being-used-to-support-mass-surveillance-of-us-citizens/">PC Gamer</a>. "No Azure for Apartheid recognizes that the same Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI technology that forms the technological backbone of Israel's apartheid and genocide is the same technology that powers ICE's violence towards migrants and communities in the United States," the group wrote.</p>
<p>"We, as Microsoft workers, stand in solidarity both with Palestinians and the communities and families in the United States who are being terrorized, detained, murdered, and deported by ICE," they continued. "We echo the demands of hundreds of workers and community members who spoke out as early as 2018 to demand Microsoft cut ties with ICE."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly revoked the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">in September last year</a>, following reporting that this tech was being used for surveilance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

            <p>"I mean, look, I think everybody knows why we announced it that way then." Stay calm, I've got to get my dinner first. "We know some things we're doing." Please stop trying to jump on the bench. "It's going to be a while yet." Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in his latest bout of interview chatter about the RPG. He's confirmed it's running on a new version of the Creation Engine, but will also be a return to Bethesda's "classic style".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think in many ways <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way," Todd the bod told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">Kinda Funny Games</a>. "As we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well.</p>
<p>"We've spent the last, you know, several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers Starfield, up to Creation Engine 3. that's going to power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond," he continued. "Obviously we do all the rendering things. We're really happy with the new stuff that we're doing, but also [in terms of] world systems loading, how we bring things into the world, how we get that detail close to the camera immediately." He added that there's also still "a lot of innovation to be done" in terms of making the game's world "feel like you are experiencing it for the first time" when you fire it up.</p>
<p>That last part I'm taking to mean that the game feels like a big leap compared to its predecessors and competition when you first fire it up, in the same way you could argue a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 did. What, I'd never seen horse balls rendered in such detail before, it was natural to feel a bit blown away. Describing Fallout 76 and Starfield as detours is also - fittingly - kinda funny, since it makes them sound a lot less like huge projects which have taken up the majority of the studio's past decade. There's also the fact plenty of folks view both games as navigational miscalculations which have sapped confidence in Bethesda's ability to not only do what they did best with games like Skyrim again, but to take that formula forwards in a fashion that can compete with today's top RPGs.</p><p>To be fair, The Elder Scrolls 6 ending up as a bit of a polarising game wouldn't be too out of step with its beloved predecessors. Skyrim's often criticised for having taken the simplifying of RPG elements too far in an undeniably successful pursuit of mass accessibility. Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 attract similar flak. Even Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> is viewed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-fallout-new-vegas">some people</a> - who are wrong - as overhyped and far too buggy. Basically what I'm saying is that not even a return to this "classic style" with some technical advancement under the bonnet may be enough not to leave TES VI an unquestionable return to form of Bethesda when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">comes out of the oven</a> in the year 3027.</p>
