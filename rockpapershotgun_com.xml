            <p>Goblin-hitting bonanza <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a> launched into early access last weekend and the devs Grinding Gear Games have dropped some big patch notes that outline some things they've updated already, or things they plan on updating in a future patch. Things like dodge-rolling, checkpoints, items, currencies, and other stuff I can't list here because the intro to this article would expand and pop into a flurry of common rarity boots and bones, maybe with the odd purple rarity sword mixed in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Among the first things on the agenda are dodge roll changes in response to players being frustrated at the frequency of being trapped by monsters. Once implemented, these tweaks should make the ol' roll a better tool for sneaking out of the grasp of pesky monsters, and even pushing small creatures like the Adorned Beetles in Keth. This doesn't mean you won't ever get trapped - there's no phasing through monsters - but the devs say the changes should mean you "can get through even the smallest gap".</p>
<p>As for checkpoints, they're taking action to save you backtracking to spots you've already discovered. In a future patch, you'll be able to teleport to other checkpoints, and checkpoints will be added to all entrances and exits of zones for those easy teleports.</p>
<p>There's been some major item drop changes, too, since players have felt that the game hasn't been rewarding enough. The devs say they've had to be "very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much". So here's a quick blast of what they've deployed now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing rare monsters has been made betterer. Rewards should naturally scale up as you reach higher levels, with rare monsters having an increased chance of having more modifiers as you progress.</li>
<li>Currency drops have largely been buffed. For instance, Regal orb drop rates have been increased by around 40%, and Gemcutter's Prism drop rates have been upped by 500%.</li>
<li>There's been a significant increase to the value of all prefix map mods.</li>
<li>"Unlucky" drop protection (when a boss drops bad loot) has been increased, so no more than 50% of unique monster drops can be gold. "Act" and "Map" bosses will always drop at least one rare, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a final flourish, an upcoming Path Of Exile 2 patch will add more rare monsters to the endgame maps.</p>
<p>If you want a quick summary of the changes that are live right now, I recommend having a glance at their official <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708">patch notes page here</a>. As for all the planned changes (with those that have been deployed, too), I recommend deep-scanning this <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">official forum thread</a>.

            <p>If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.</p>
<p>I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am afraid now. I highlight the above words, and reach to press Ctrl+C. My curled pinkie finds its target instantly, but my index finger hesitates. Sense memory rushes through synapses. Somewhere, a rodent’s heart beats as it chews pensively on a bin bag yoghurt splotch. A moth’s wings flutter as it practises scaring the shit out of someone in the shower. A cascade of pigeon poop plummets into a lunching office worker’s quintuple-named Starbucks drink, ironically making it taste slightly more like real coffee. My index finger finds its mark, so quickly as to be indistinguishable to anyone as a lapse in cohesion.</p>
<p>Anyone but me.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I type these words manually, refusing to cast aside yet more of my fleeting mortality to the micro-micro-microseconds I’ve now identified between my pressing of Ctrl and V. For I now realise what that ‘+’ symbol has taken from me. A gulf of time and possibility. A gaping wound of opportunity. A subtraction in mocking masquerade.</p><p>I have seen the face of the cosmic jester that jabs and japes at the apex of all realities, and his name is the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. Which is just the sort of bollocks you’d expect from him, honestly.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I am typing this manually again. It feels, in some small way, like an act of reclamation. One less layer of simulacrum in the chain of words on a website, copied from words in a document, copied from words in a dictionary, copied from soundwaves uttered by human mouths, inspired by abstract concepts, material realities glimpsed and filtered through subjective experience, dreams where someone offers you a grape but there’s a tiny version of your own dad living inside the grape and you say “I can’t eat that, it’s my dad!” and your dad shouts from inside the grape “but you must, son. <em>You must</em>.”</p>
<p>Perhaps I must. And perhaps I must also purchase the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. I’m actually genuinely curious to see whether it makes my life any easier. Maybe I could set up little macros for Total Warhammer. Maybe I could finally start to live again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
