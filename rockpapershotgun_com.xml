            <p>
I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to  admit that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.

I'm glad that like many games before it, it's copying Breath of the Wild's climbing so you can scale pretty much any clifface. Once you're up there you can do the video game staple that is scanning your environment to reveal the nearby area on your map, which will highlight shipwrecks or abandoned testing stations. You know, the Ubisoft effect. What actually makes that kind of interesting are the coriolis storms.

Most of the times storms in video games are just about blocking your vision, preventing you from going somewhere, maybe making it harder for you to be seen by enemies and vice versa, but Dune: Awakening's coriolis storms change the entire map every single week. Being an online survival game, obviously this is something to keep players coming back so that it feels fresh week to week, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> can execute it well it could make for an interesting time, the headaches for cartographers aside.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to jump into the game, you can't quite do that yet because it's not out until May 20th. However! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-time-to-create-a-character-and-benchmark-a-sandworm-in-dune-awakening-assuming-youre-buying-it-in-may">You can already make your character ahead of its release</a>, so you've got plenty of time to make a cooler, more sci-fiy version of yourself, or some nightmarish creation you post on social media for 11 likes.

            <p>
Remember when Nvidia announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> RTX mod way back in, crikey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-rtx-mod-brings-ray-tracing-and-dlss-to-another-valve-classic">2023</a>? Yeah, I didn't realise how long it had been either. To be perfectly honest I thought it had already come out, but apparently not, because just this week Nvidia shared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-rtx">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> is getting a demo next week on March 18th. No, the full mod still doesn't have a release date, but when do any game projects ever release quickly after they were announced?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo will specifically let you play through the Ravenholm and Nova <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prospekt">Prospekt</a> levels, and a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">really long blog post from Nvidia</a> has desperately tried to make it clear all of the ways this mod supposedly makes the original game look better. Apparently "every aspect of each level has been upgraded" and everything from weapons, to enemies, to skyboxes have all been remade.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Half-Life 2 RTX | Demo with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 4 Announce" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j31ISEd8xRM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Nvidia's blog post lets you do that thing where you can slide an image back and forth to see what it looks like with RTX on and off, and to be perfectly honest, most of the time it doesn't look better, it just looks foggier. The original game still looks incredible to this day if you ask me, there's a reason so many people still love it. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, most people aren't going to be able to play the dang thing anyway - the post notes that to "play at the level of detail shown in the screenshots and videos seen in this article, we recommend a GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card," even if there are ways to supposedly "ensure a great experience on previous-generation GPUs, too." I don't think I want to turn my PC into a jet engine for a 20 year old game, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
The base version of Half-Life 2 actually got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">pretty nice update</a> last November for its 20th anniversary, which folded Episodes One and Two into the main package, and even fixed some old bugs. Cheers for that again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a>.

            <p>
A new week, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update, and a pretty hefty one has arrived at that. Before we get on to some of the more notable changes, over on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian's</a> forum pages where you can read the <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134488-patch-130-notes/">full patch notes</a>, the developer shared that in the coming weeks it plans to release a roadmap that will "go over some of the plans we have that will be coming to the game over the upcoming year." Whether that be DLC, free content, or just some planned gameplay changes, I couldn't tell you, your guess is as good as mine.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right, about those various updates. Firstly, there's a number of community requested features that have been added in and/ or tweaked, like your player character getting an additional talent point at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Any of you with save files past any of those levels will find that they have those additional points now. Those of you on PC playing with a mouse and keyboard have the option to toggle between walking and running now too.
</p>
<p>
A nice accessibility feature has been added in too, you can now increase the font size and apply bold styling to all documents, tutorials, in-game pop-ups, and the ledger's quest tab. The photographers amongst you will be pleased to hear that you can now keybind the option to toggle your HUD on and off for cleaner screenshots, or reduce the HUD's opacity if you like your health bar being transparent for some reason.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, camera-wise an FOV slider has been added for playing in third-person, and you can lock the compass to always point north instead of rotating inputs. All of you controller players can completely customise your button inputs now too. There's a whole laundry list of other fixes, tweaks, and improvements that I won't bore you with here, but it certainly looks like it'll make for a smoother experience overall. Happy Avowing! Or whatever it is you do, I haven't played it yet.

            <p>
People love to go on and on about how good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2's</a> campaign mode is, and they'd be right to do so, but really we all know there's one specific level we have in mind when it comes to the sidelined shooter: the time travel one. I don't care for shooters all that much, online or offline ones, yet I still gave a go because the time travel level really appealed to me mechanically. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored 2's</a> similarly structured time travel section wooed me similarly, so I was very pleased to discover the newest trailer for Tenet of the Spark this week, an action-adventure game that is basically Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2's time travel levels made into an entire game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Tenet of the Spark has a few things that sets itself differently from said two levels. In the first instance, it's pretty much all melee combat. Punchin', hammerin', knife throwin', that sort of thing. Where the time travel element is most notably different is that you can travel between three time periods: modern day, the Viking age, and the Aztec era. The thing that I'm finding most fun from the game's trailer, as you can see above, is that the level design is more or less the same across all three time periods, with the set dressing being the big thing to change.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Enemies themselves stay in the same spots throughout the three periods too, with each setting looking to have its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the Viking setting, you can throw or push objects, and you've got a big ole hammer you can smack things with, whereas in the Aztec period you've got a knife you can chuck at baddies for some long-distance options.
</p>
<p>
It's neat! And stylish as all hell too, I love the effect of the environment changing between time periods, everything shifts and pops a little bit, it's not just swapping you from one scene to the next. The game has been in the works for a little while now, but doesn't have a release date just yet. If it takes your fancy, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2565010/Tenet_of_the_Spark/">wishlist it here</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, you might have seen the abomination that was an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leaked-video-shows-playstation-toying-with-aloy-from-horizon-as-an-ai-chatbot">AI-powered version of Horizon series protagonist Aloy</a>. It came as part of a leak that showed Sony experimenting with the ability to chat to video game characters that use OpenAI and Chat-GPT to respond, though Sony quickly saw to scrubbing any evidence of footage using the power of copyright laws. Notably the voice behind this AI version of Aloy was not that of her voice actor's, Ashly Burch, but the voice actor has offered up her own thoughts on the whole situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Quite quickly in the video Burch shared to TikTok, she explained that developer Guerilla had contacted her to claim that the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development", and importantly didn't use any of her vocal or facial performance. Even with that, Burch did still say she feels "worried", not about "Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form."
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
As Burch points out, The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a>) is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">currently on strike</a>, specifically because of concerns over AI being used to replace actors in the game development process, and that they're asking for protections from its usage. This includes very reasonable things like requiring consent before making an AI version of the actor in question, fair compensation, and to be informed of how the AI dub is being used.
</p>
<p>
For Burch, her concern is a video like this coming out that is based on someone's performance, and "the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn't have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."
</p>
<p>
The leaked video is just a tech demo, it's not something we'll necessarily see implemented in any games or for other purposes, but personally I hope it stays as buried as Sony's lawyers are trying to make the footage. Fingers crossed SAG-AFTRA gets their needs met.
