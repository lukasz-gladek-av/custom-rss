            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you failed to swipe a key for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta, because you <em>neither</em> signed up via the Battlefield Labs programme before 31st July <em>nor</em> watched Your Favourite Creators play the game during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">recent multiplayer reveal</a>, then Don't Sweat It, Soldier, because Drill Sergeant EA Have Your Back in the shape of a last-gasp code giveaway. </p>
<p>All you have to do is sign into the EA and Twitch apps, then watch 30 minutes of Your Favourite Creators streaming the game. Unfortunately for me, the suggestion that I watch 30 minutes of anything on Twitch is a grievous insult akin to filling my wineglass with Vimto or farting on my outstretched hand. I hate game streaming and so do you, which is why neither of us will be playing Battlefield 6 this weekend. I will share further details of the giveaway only out of a sense of absolute perversity.
</p>
<p>Here's the specific wording from Drill Sergeant EA.</p>
<blockquote>The first step in participating is logging into your EA and Twitch accounts and linking them HERE. Then, during Battlefield 6 Open Beta Early Access, August 7th &amp; 8th, tune into your favorite creators streaming Battlefield 6 to unlock your own early access code after watching just 30 minutes.* Once you have your Twitch Drops code, visit Battlefield's Code Redemption page and enter the code to get Early Access added to your account. </blockquote>
<p>The little asterisk there is for "while supplies last". Perhaps it's too late, and you'll have to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boomtown-rats-transformice">Transformice</a> instead.</p>
<p>These giveaways are business as usual for videogame publishers, but I've found EA's attempts to drive up Twitch engagement with Your Favourite Creators kind of eerie. It's an open effort to cook the numbers and fox Twitch's visibility algorithm. I imagine they don't care whether you actually watch Your Favourite Creators, only that you leave your fingerprints on the client, so why not turn on Twitch, lower the volume and spend 30 minutes ensuring that all of your socks are correctly paired.</p>
<p>If you're a real sucker for punishment, EA are also handing out cosmetics for people who carry on Twitching their Favourite Creators. Here's what you get for time served, with some observations of my own about how your state of mind might escalate in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for 1 Hour and, once you have conquered your nausea, you will earn the Mimic Weapons Package</li>
<li>Watch for 2 Hours and, once you have stopped feverishly washing your face, you will earn the Landslide Soldier Skin</li>
<li>Watch for 3 Hours and, once you have stopped cursing the day you were born, you will earn the Shattered Vehicle Skin </li>
<li>Watch for 4 Hours and, once the police have persuaded you to come down from the tree, you will earn the Imperial Soldier Skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I mentioned that I really hate game streaming? I'm sorry if you don't, and I'm harshing your buzz. I probably just haven't found the right streamer. Recommendations pls. People who prefer the comforting silence of text might want to read James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6 hands-on thoughts</a> instead. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people]]></content:encoded>
