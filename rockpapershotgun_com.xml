            <p>
Who's that I hear coming down my chimney? Why, it's… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/megabonk">Megabonk's</a> "Spooky" update? No, that doesn't sound quite right to me either, and yet it is in fact the truth of this world. As you've probably already gathered by the name of the update, this is one that was meant to be out for Halloween, but developer Vedinad needed a touch more time for it.
</p>
<p>
As explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340/view/523110495538905880?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing all the new stuff, it was originally planned as just a tiny Halloween update, but they wanted to add in a few other bits and pieces, so the workload just ended up being bigger. Anyway, here's some of the bits you can expect from the update, which is admittedly scant in precise details.
</p>
<p>
There's a new map, character, weapon, as well as new items, enemies and bosses, achievements, and challenges. To get any more insight on any of this, you'll have to play the game for yourself, as the post literally says nothing else about new additions. Although, the game's Zwitter account <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/2000274122127897019">does note</a> that there's "canned spaghetti with extra sauce," if that means anything to anyone.
</p>
<p>
It's not just new things, however. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> clone should look a bit smoother late-game with some FPS improvements for one. A number of bugs have been fixed, including one where you could buy items you didn't have unlocked, and another annoying one where the game might reset when teleporting to the next stage to keep your progress, and in turn resulting in not moving to the next stage.
</p><p>
There's a bunch of balancing bits and new settings to be found as well, and an interesting addition for speedrunner, potentially. You can now open up the game's console, which as noted by the devs, is "only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something." Anyway, what's next, a Christmas update in July? Humbug!

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a>'s getting a bunch of new quests just in time for the holidays, with an update dubbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> sending you off to investigate a mysterious headache-inducing radio signal when it arrives tomorrow, December 16th. There'll also be a new hub area in the Burnt Forest and a new suppressed rifle for you to fiddle with as you chill by the campfire.</p>

<p>Announced, seemingly a bit ahead of time judging by the trailer being an unlisted video, by a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the update's since been <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000587226904744392">acknowledged by developers GSC themselves</a> via some eye emojis and <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/2000593761798336770">confirmation</a> that it'll also be coming to PC.</p>
<p>The update's story takes place across eight new quests which GSC stress "can take hours to complete", with new locations and characters waiting for you along the way. Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," reads the tale's synopsis. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>"Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong." To get started, you'll need to listen out for an emergency transmission which'll seemingly lead you towards the Red Forest.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can't have a new quest without a new gun, so the update's introducing the GP37V2 rifle - a GP37 which had had a suppressor stuck to it and been messed with so it only fires single shots or bursts. GSC stress that its uber-tactical nature means it's suited to the most tactically tactical of tacticians. You can also just take along your tried and tested old gun.</p>
<p>Finally the update can end up adding a new hub to the Burning Forest, where you'll be able to rest for a bit before heading back out. It sounds like whether you get this extra chill spot will depend on which choices you make as you investigate the mysterious signal.</p>
