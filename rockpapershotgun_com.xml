            <p>
More than two years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft's</a> last mass round of layoffs, the company is laying off a huge amount of staff once again. As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a>, the tech giant is laying off 3% of employees across the entire company, meaning all levels, teams, and geographies. While nothing has been directly confirmed as of yet, this does include the possibility that some games studios it owns will be affected too - we'll provide an update if there is one.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company will "continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The spokesperson also said that one objective of the layoffs is to reduce layers of management. As always, a ridiculously heartless way to frame such a thing. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As of last June, Microsoft had around 228,000 employees, meaning a little under 7000 workers could be out of work soon. This is by far the biggest round of layoffs the company has enacted since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, though 650 workers were put out of employment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">last September too</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that these layoffs come after Microsoft reported that its net income increased by 18% year-on-year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">just this April</a>. Doesn't exactly scream a company that desperately needs to make cuts.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's unclear if any games studios under Microsoft's ownership have been affected by this decision. But as a reminder, based on the stats of an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">unofficial games industry layoffs tracker</a>, so far this year there's been an estimated 2200 jobs lost. 2024 saw around 14,600, 2023 around 10,500, and 2022 around 8500. Good luck to those affected.

            <p>
Anyone that's played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Souls</a> game knows how it tells its stories. You meet a wide range of characters, all of which mostly just talk at you in varyingly cryptic ways. There's also tiny bits of lore offered up from weapons and items too, all of which build up a messy picture. But in something like the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, where the main focus is gameplay that encourages you to constantly be on the move, I've been left wondering how its story will play out. As it turns out, it's quite different from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first">IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki set the scene a little bit explaining that "Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention - it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition."
</p>
<p>
That opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, the preset characters you play as. As opposed to Elden Ring, where there is a main plot so to seek, you'll mostly be trying to learn about the Nightfarers' respective pasts through Remembrances.
</p>
<p>
In Nightreign's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a>, you can check out the character you play as' Remembrances through a journal. Sometimes these are just logs, other times you'll be taken to specific areas to live out memories. Once you've spoken with an NPC within a Remembrance, you then get a task to complete. These vary from character to character, like how Wylder might need to go find a particular item in a cave, or how Raider has to win 1v1 boss fights.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'll have to wait and see how I feel about this structure when actually playing the game. I'm confident all the Nightfarers' backstories will have that classic FromSoft appealing vagueness, I just worry that they'll just feel a bit tacked on rather than properly woven in. Happy to be proven wrong, I do like the sound of each character needing to do different things, so I'll cross my fingers that it works out.

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> has the bones of a great action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>," I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">wrote last November</a>. Developers Digital Extremes continue to graft flesh to those bones, plumping the world-building's marrow and cranking the sinews of the combat. The game's Preludes edition - a sort of relentlessly expanding limited-access beta - <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/patch-notes/0-9-0">continues to be updated</a> with new weapons, faction features, player Pacts (classes, essentially), areas, and enemies. They've also made some revisions, which include turning the Idol system into a distinct set of weapons so as to give it "a more focused purpose in your arsenal".</p> <!--more-->
<p>Despite promising myself that I would try to keep up with Soulframe's development, after flopping out of the FOMO boat with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, I managed to overlook the original edition of the Idol system. Digital Extremes have certainly been busy, and more is in the offing: the 10th Preludes update, due this month, will further expand upon the new Motes and Runes upgrades system while adding some throwable secondary weapons and a wizard's staff with respectable Dragon's Dogma energy.</p>
<p>Here's a trailer to show off the Preludes build as it currently stands, plus a few of the aforementioned new trinkets.</p>

<p>So how do Motes (which already exist to some extent in-game) work as upgrades? As detailed at <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/news/soulframe-at-pax-east-2025">PAX East</a>, they're tiny Ghibli-ass critters you'll find around the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. Once caught, they can be ordered to take up possession inside a weapon to provide a new ability - freezing enemies solid, for example.</p>
<p>You can also release them if you have a duplicate Mote to acquire feeding materials for your remaining Motes, strengthening them. Or, you can have your weapon's Mote feast on the soul of an enemy. In the dev stream, Digital Extremes jocularly observe that none of this is anything like Pokemon. They've clearly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">keeping up with current events</a>.</p>
<p>Runes, meanwhile, are modifiers for Motes, placed in sockets on your inventory. They grant boons such as more staggering power after you nail a perfect dodge. There are 20 new Motes coming in Preludes 10, and the hope is to let players start properly build-crafting in a simulation that has hitherto been more about levelling up and acquiring more potent gear.</p>
<p>Upcoming new enemies, meanwhile, include a boss, the Tired King, whom the devs liken to the Ringwraiths in LOTR. He doesn't seem tired so much as great at delegation, summoning minions to attack you. They're also working on the second Soulframe in-game event, the Festival of the Circade. Where the first was Halloween-flavoured, this one takes inspiration from recent house-wrangling doozie <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> with a new puzzle location, the Crypt of Circade.</p>
<p>All these bits and pieces notwithstanding, I still find Soulframe appealing for approximately the same reasons I did in 2024. It casts you as a lonely roving paladin in a realm of enchanted animals that is being steadily ruined by pollutant-spewing oiks in metal hats. It blends sword and sorcery into a graceful procession of combos, parries, buffs, projectiles and finishers. I wouldn't say the combat is very difficult or complex but it has fluidity and charisma. I enjoy inhabiting a body that can do stuff like this.</p>
<p>The dungeon ambience is fairly absorbing as procgen creations go, and the lore writing has a gnarled, fey intensity that sometimes comes across as garnish for a nothingburger, but is often quite fun. The weapon and equipment art is as handsome as you'd find in Warframe, but not as 'extra', you know? A little easier to behold without developing a migraine. Forgive me, Warframers - I am old, and brighter colours upset me. I like my tapestries faded, my armour dusty and my blades notched and blunted... but not broken.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
