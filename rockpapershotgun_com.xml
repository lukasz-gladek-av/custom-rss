            <p>Do subscribe to <a href="https://youtu.be/F707wIeTX2g">Tim Cain's YouTube channel</a> if you haven't already. The Fallout creator is eminently listenable and seems to have an infinite well of great stories about a career working on formative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s. His latest is on <a href="https://youtu.be/F707wIeTX2g">game preservation</a>, in which he reveals that Fallout developer and publisher Interplay had to approach him after he'd left the company to ask if he still had development archives they'd ordered him to destroy. The reason? "Oops! We lost it", Cain says (cheers, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">Games Radar</a>).</p>

<p>Cain gives three reasons why he thinks we've already lost a good chunk of the medium's history: either "no-one thought to keep it", people wanted to "keep their things private", or "there's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it."</p>
<p>"This has happened multiple times in my career. When I left Fallout, I was told 'You have to destroy everything you have.' and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code. Gone." (GURPS is Steve Jackson's 'Generic Universal RolePlaying System', which Fallout intended to use until a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_13:_A_GURPS_Post-Nuclear_Adventure#Termination_and_legal_issues">messy approval process</a> resulted in the creation of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system.)</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'Oops, we lost it', I thought they were trapping me into 'We're going to sue you if you say you have it," Cain says. "Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Among the casualties of Interplay's slapdash archiving were, says Cain, the GURPS code, possibly the original artwork and, perhaps most tragically, the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Talking_head">clay heads used to animate conversations</a>.</p>
<p>A fine example of never attributing to malice what you can to carelessness, this. "No one is against the idea of video game preservation, but companies and their shareholders are against the idea of not making a profit,” the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>'s Frank Cifaldi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">told me last year</a>. “It's a technical black hole; It costs a lot of money to port a video game, and if the margins are just not there, then there's not a business rationale to keep things alive.”</p>
<p>Still, there's seemingly been an uptick in companies making more of an effort recently, such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/playstation-is-using-a-cold-storage-vault-and-mineshafts-to-save-its-30-year-history">Playstation using mineshafts</a> to lovingly store old copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> in. This is good, because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-warren-spector-keeps-emailing-me-about-books">What's On Your Bookshelf </a>patron saint Warren Spector surely cannot rescue gaming history single-handedly, no matter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-creator-warren-spector-has-literally-dumpster-dived-to-help-with-game-preservation">how much dumpster diving he does</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> announced that both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> would be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">getting offline modes</a>, something quite likely driven (pun intended) by how upset people were by the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> being shut down completely. There's an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy">ongoing lawsuit</a> over the first game and all! Still, The Crew 2 and Motorfest getting an offline mode is something, and there's a playtest for the former coming next week, April 30th.
</p>

<p>
Producer Gregory Corgie shared this in a quick update video (you can watch that below) that mostly focuses on The Crew 2, as that's the one that'll be getting an offline mode first. It's probably worth noting that not everyone is guaranteed access to the aforementioned playtest, it'll be based on their individual "configurations and previous involvement in the community." Don't worry about your save either, as it'll be a separate one made for the sole purpose of testing the offline mode.

<p>
As it stands, the developer is apparently planning to release a hybrid mode, meaning you can switch between on- and offline, by the end of this year. The reason you're not getting an outright offline mode right out the gate is pretty much just because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game was designed to be an always online game, so Ubisoft need to actually make sure an offline mode works 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>
Corgie also made sure to make it clear that no, online multiplayer features won't be available in offline mode, though this won't apply to all aspects of the game. Not entirely sure if this point needed to be made, but he did also say a full list of what features will and won't work will be coming further down the line. I imagine that'll actually be a useful thing to hear other than the obvious difference between online and offline gameplay.
</p>
<p>
I do have to wonder if the existence of an offline mode for The Crew 2 and Motorfest will hinder Ubisoft at all in the ongoing lawsuit against them. They argue that those that purchased the game were "purchasing a license" to play it, not to own the actual game, which is obviously a stinking pile of "um, actually…", so it's a matter of waiting to see if that argument works out for them.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are probably more frequently remembered as a horror developer, what with their first couple of games being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">slightly troubled</a> (but very good) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. Surprisingly, their follow-up to the latter wasn't another horror game, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a>, a Sekiro-inspired 2D action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a> that just looks stunning in motion. It was a welcome surprise! Developers should never feel beholden to expectations, and Red Candle Games have once again offered up a lovely little surprise in the form of a Nine Sols prequel manga.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As it turns out, the reason for its existence is a pretty simple one: the devs just had too much story for one game (but mostly "time constraints and other factors"). So, as they explain in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1809540/announcements/detail/544481587857719320">Steam post</a>, last year they "established a partnership with Mojoin", a site for a whole bunch of webcomics, as well as hooked up with artist Yang Chi-Cheng. "As a result, what was once an extravagant idea for us gradually became a reality through the collective efforts of everyone involved, especially with the invaluable contributions of Mr. Yang," Red Candle Games explained.
</p>
<p>
The plot is set "long before" Nine Sols itself, though I'm not sure how long before, and focuses on two Solarians who "forever altered the course of Penglai’s history." The manga is also, quite conveniently available in English alongside Chinese and Japanese, and the first chapter is <a href="https://mojoin.com/comics/224#chapter">already available to read too</a>. Update will apparently be coming weekly on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
I haven't actually had the good fortune of playing Nine Sols just yet, our own Nic liked it so much it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nine-sols-review">turned him around on the genre</a>, so I've only had a skim of the manga myself. Therefore, I can't really speak to the story all that much, but the artwork is great. Lots of confident linework that captures the style of the game very well. What a treat! Perhaps it's time for me to pick the game up…
