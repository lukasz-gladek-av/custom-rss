            <p>It's here. No, not the end of the world as we know it, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Arrowhead had been teasing adding said cape, dubbed "Pillars of Freedom", to the game as an inside joke since that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">whole PSN controversy last year</a>, when HD2 got so many negative reviews from folks angry at account linking being made mandatory that its Steam graph's red lines were long enough inspire amateur fashion designers. The developers and Sony have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">restored access</a> to the game in a bunch of countries the PSN change rendered it unpurchasable in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes">paving the way</a> for this gear gag.</p>

<p>"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead tweeted upon deploying this back-covering cloth that resembles the Steam review graph at the time of the review bombing, "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armories as soon as the rollout is complete.</p>
<p>"This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."</p> <div>

<p>Cue raucous celebrations in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1llsfy9/review_bomb_cape_is_here/">Redditosphere</a> and on Discord. "I can’t believe they actually did it," wrote one joyous player, "And good on them for waiting until Sony actually opened the game back up to all those countries, instead of last year when everyone was celebrating the half-victory."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another declared: "I'm not taking it off. I waited a long year for my country to be removed from [the] region block." Yep, this really has been a long time in the making.</p>
<p>Sony walked back their plans to make the account mandatory on May 6, 2024. It's now June 27, 2025. 13 months. 60 weeks. 417 days. Something in the region of 9,998 hours. Something in the region of 599,910 minutes. Something in the region of 35,994,615 seconds.</p>
<p>Babies have been born. People have died. Countless hells have been dived.</p>
<p>And now, cape.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape]]></content:encoded>
