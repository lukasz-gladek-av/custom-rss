            <p>Oh shit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> comes out tomorrow, November 14th. As you'd expect, Activision have been busy yelling about it amid the deafening din of about 10,000 other games whizzing past per minute. There are some launch day patch notes and a rundown of what the mode you unlock if you beat the single-player bit involves. Let's take a gander.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">day one patch notes</a> can be found here, running through the myriad of adjustments which have been made since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">the beta</a>. There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtHucpVlJM">video</a> too. Things like the strength of rotational aim assist, increases to the rate at which weapon XP's earned, and a general slowing dow of player slideage are talked about. "Adjusted mantling for smoother, faster, and more consistent mantles" is fun to read, especially if you assume it means mantling in <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mantling">the Elder Scrolls sense</a>. There are also specific sections for multiplayer and zombies, if only one of those is your bag.</p>
<p>I'm not here for any of that, though. You see, a lot of the notes focus on outlining adjustments to certain weapons, and the formatting's very much the text on a screen equivalent of a candlelit diner. "My name's M15 MOD 0," an assault rifle says coyly. "I've gotten a new mid damage range. This will make it more difficult to achieve a 4-shot kill with headshots beyond close range." Ooh, saucy. May I pour a bit more wine for you to slurp up via one of your many attachments, which have also been tweaked?</p>
<p>They keep coming (ooh, Matron!). The MXR-17, the Peacekeeper Mark 1, the Ryden 45K, the Dravec 45, the M10 Breacher. Each showing off their fancy damage numbers and range stats, both old and new. They've changed, you see. "Do you love me now?" each asks. I dunno. You're just guns in a video game. That's a lot of commitment.</p>
<p>They're just too much, man. I've had to pull myself away and look at another Black Ops 7 thing Activision have been talking about this week.</p>

<p>As outlined in the dev chat above, it's called endgame. Basically, once you've finished Blops 7's campaign, you unlock a multiplayer mode revolving around a big fight with up to 32 players slugging it out across a huge map. Said map's a weird Frankenstein's monster of locations around fictional Call of Duty city-state <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>, with maps from previous Blopses grafted onto it various places, for maximum nostalgia. "We wanted to continue the campaign in a replayable way," design director Kevin Drew.</p><p>There are "four escalating zones of difficulty" top work through, each of which has "more toxin, more enemies, harder challenges, and better rewards". You can also hop in with friends who haven't completed the campaign, so long as you have and are the host in order to invite them.</p>
<p>Oh no. Now all of those guns from before are asking me if I love them enough to invite them into endgame. Ah, uh, sorry, I'm gonna be washing my hair when Blops 7 launches at 5AM GMT / 12AM ET / 9PM PT on November 14th.</p>
