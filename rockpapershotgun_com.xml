            <p>
It's been a while since we've had a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director Cory Davis. As far as I can tell, the last game he made was 2016's Here They Lie, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game. He's currently working on another horror game in fact, Sleep Awake, which is a horrendous name, though I think it's doing some interesting things. Weirdly, he's making the game alongside Nine Inch Nails guitarist (for live shows, anyway) Robin Finck, and while the game doesn't have a release date, it did just receive a demo.
</p>
<p>
Lemme tell ya, if there's one thing you can take away from Sleep Awake it's that PS3 games are back! Let me define what I mean here so I don't just sound like I'm trying to press some buzz words for the fun of it. I think a key thing about the PS3 era of games is that there was so much more scope for much more intimately designed, linear spaces, with much more room for detail compared to the PS2, but not quite enough resources to design something completely lifelike.
</p>

<p>
In a lot of ways, these intricately designed games often just had facades up, they looked bigger and more impressive than they actually were. The upside is that it also often made for interesting art direction, and a better established sense of space. So many big budget games now do look life-like, but the tradeoff is that all of this detail gets lost through the sheer quantity of it.
</p><p>
Sleep Awake's demo was only short, and very much felt like one long corridor, but it was an interesting to look at corridor. Your classic case of random bits of graffiti and wall carvings to denote story, interacting with random objects that does nothing but let you look at them close-up, data logs with bits of flavour text to build up the lore, it's all there.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of lore, or story I suppose, this game is set in a world where there's some kind of weird illness thingy that whisks people away if they fall asleep, so the protagonist is doing what they can to stay awake at all times, which occasionally leads to some hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
To be perfectly honest, the narrative didn't feel all that compelling. As mentioned, the demo was short, and did quite a bad job of bringing me into this world, it felt too jarring and disconnected. There also just wasn't really anything to actually do apart from walk around, look at some bits, and one very short section at the end where I had to hide from an enemy. I'd be remiss to not mention the fact that the writing was stilted and awkward, and the main character's performance matched that feeling a little too well unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
Still, the atmosphere and visuals pulled me in all the same. There's parts that are intercut with live action footage which, to its credit, actually unnerved me. A real arthouse, '70s vibe about it I feel I could really get down with. It is certainly going for a unique look, and I felt charmed by its 2009 throwback vibes, even if I'm uncertain of whether it'll be any good or not.
</p><p>
Still, it's a curious thing to have a game from someone that designed one of the most discussed games of the 2010s, and someone that plays guitar for Nine Inch Nails sometimes. Worth a punt! You can try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>.

            <p>
What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> was a bit less sci-fi, and a lot more medieval? You would, in theory, get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, a game that first entered early access in June last year. Responses to it so far appear to be, well, mixed, but as seems to be quite common with These Kinds Of Games, everyone that's played it appears to be going through some kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of situation, as the game is still going. It's going so far as to launch into 1.0 in fact, and developer Mainframe Industries have even put a date to it.
</p>
<p>
That release date is October 16th, about half a month away at the time of writing (assuming I still know how to read calendars). Mainframe outlined what you can expect in the leadup to the launch, as well as what will happen at launch itself in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/510718530665054707?l=english">Steam news post</a> too.
</p>
<p>
From October 6th until the 14th, servers for the game will be completely offline. On the 14th, at 3am PDT, anyone that owns a founder's pack will have access to the game's 1.0 servers, and then on the 16th at 8am PDT, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> will be available to everyone. Something to note is that with the launch of 1.0, everyone that has been playing so far will have everything wiped - shards, characters, plots, inventories, skills, and more. This is the final wipe though, Mainframe explained, so you won't have to worry if you're new to the game.
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that Pax Dei will also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/524223243273373577">subscription model</a>. You can just play the game by buying it, but memberships give you a whole bunch of extras that do seem a little bit unfair. In particular, depending on which membership plan you go for, you'll get a number of plot tokens, which let you literally own certain pieces of land - that you have to continuously pay for with said tokens. Yes, this is essentially digital rent. Whether this works out or not, well, we'll find out in the next few months.
