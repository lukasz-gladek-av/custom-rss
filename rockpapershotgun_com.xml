You might not think of it as one, but Wikipedia is a game. It has untold numbers of characters and stories, each page an interactive slate with your mouse and hand acting as the choice maker for what you learn next, thus impacting your following choices. This is, admittedly, a bit of a wanky, thinkpiecey way of talking about Wikipedia, so instead of that let's talk about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neurocracy">Neurocracy</a>, a game that could quite easily fool you into thinking it is another version of Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It first launched a couple of years ago now, in 2023, and started its third season earlier this year. In fact, its final episode for season three is coming next week on September 17th, so now seems like a pretty good time to get started with diving into it.

There is is no main character in Neurocracy so to speak, other than you, and you are browsing <a href="https://omnipedia.app/wiki/2049/10/09/Main_Page">Omnipedia</a>, a very real but still fictitious website you can head to right now to view everything, though the full version of the game has a virtual conspiracy pin board you can use to unravel the mystery with - we'll come back to that.
</p><p>
Omnipedia, according to its in-world description, is an "English-language online encyclopedia founded by internet entrepreneur Tony Hsiung in June 2049. Intended as “a general reference work and trusted source of information,” Hsiung initially conceived of Omnipedia as a successor to Wikipedia, which was discontinued in 2048." 
</p>
<p>
We've already learned a few things here - that we're a good couple of decades into the future, and Wikipedia is dead. Gathering bits of information like that is the name of the game, though you're after juicier pieces than that, as there's a murder mystery to be solved. As you find actually useful pieces of information, within the full version of the game you can add particular links and bits of text to build this conspiracy for yourself.
</p>
<p>
I've only dipped my toe into Neurocracy's world, it's impressively expansive, though it does feel like the kind of thing you should add to slowly, with only the occasional day of falling through the rabbit hole here and there.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, Neurocracy's third and final season wraps up next week, September 17th, but you can pick it up on <a href="https://pyrofoux.itch.io/neurocracy">Itch.io</a> now to start getting yourself ready for it.

            <p>
Getting your game a publishing deal has never been an easy thing to do. Right now, it's especially hard given that for many publishers, if it doesn't seem like a guaranteed hit, it likely isn't something they'll take on. This is something that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/poncle">Poncle</a>, or rather the actual person, Luca Galante, takes great issue with, and in a recent interview he spoke more broadly of his issues with publishers, and his thoughts on now being one.
</p>
<p>
"I see a lot of publishers I don't like, and I think that's my way to define what a good publisher should be, probably," Galante explained to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/i-see-a-lot-of-publishers-i-dont-like-vampire-survivors-creator-made-his-own-publisher-to-share-the-luck-and-says-too-many-companies-try-to-exploit-the-platforms-just-to-make-money/">GamesRadar</a>. "I see a lot of publishers that try to exploit the platforms just to make money, basically, because the video game industry is very obviously an industry that makes a lot of money. There is a lot of money to make. I see that these publishers will try and just exploit platforms for money."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note how there are publishers who will put out simply incomplete games, or early access games that never get finished, and that for him, "what a publisher should do is, first of all, make genuine games, genuine products, something that has some real value, and then understand that not everything can be a breakout hit." Galante also spoke of the importance of post-launch support, and for him this is "definitely a big thing from my point of view that publishers should be able to offer."
</p>
<p>
As of now, Poncle has published two games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> or Die, a beat 'em up where you have to mash your keyboard to beat enemies, and Kill the Brickman, a Brick Breaker-esque, turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> game, both of which are cheap as chips (£3 and £4 respectively).
</p><p>
It's these kinds of affordable games with smaller teams that Galante wants to lean towards in publishing, and in particular his priority is to find devs "that are very transparent in what they do, they want to talk with their community, and they have a real, genuine passion for making games." Not only that, it's important to him that these devs get to realise their vision by enriching it, as opposed to forcing in things like microtransactions or season passes.
</p>
<p>
Galante is, perhaps most importantly, fully aware with how lucky he got with Vampire Survivors, and that's why he wants to publish other games. "We definitely made some mistakes when it comes to putting the game out there, but we learned a lot, and wanted to try to sort of share what we learned with other indies. It was a way to try and give something back to the indie community, share the luck." Good luck indeed! At this point in time, every dev needs every ounce of the stuff they can get.
