            <p>
Alas and alack for Lickity Split, knight hero of The Fortress, prisoner of a villainous Sorceror King. ‘Twas I who named him (I wanted a pun on “Lich” and I’m fairly sure we’ve done “Lich My Balls” several times before) and ‘twas I who led him to his death a whole six rooms away from his cell... and ‘twas I who then resurrected him as a wizard and got him killed again, a mere five minutes later. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s not my fault, though. Lickity Split appears to have terrible luck, if not an actual Luck stat, and The Fortress is a dungeon crawler with a murderous fixation on dice. As regards the opening stretch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">the Steam demo</a>, at least, each fight sees you rolling dice of three different colours, then spending their pips to attack enemies with health points of the same colour. If the colours don’t match up, you’ll have to end the turn and take damage. 
</p>
<p>
The get-out clause is that any unused dice fill up a Super Mega Ultra AOE Attack gauge when you end the turn. This dishes out punishment without regard for niceties of coloration. That’s not much consolation if you get hacked to death before the gauge fills completely, though. Woe unto Lickity Split! I thought he was doing pretty well until he ran into that ghost dog.
</p>
<p>
There are nine character classes in The Fortress, each of which favours a different dice hue, or combination of hues. There are also three slots for equipment pieces that modify the dice, or confer shorter-lived benefits. A rusty shield will cancel one incoming attack before disintegrating; an enchanted scroll will add a pip to your blue magic die. There are also potential allies, or at least beings who are not initially enemies: “vampire merchants, fallen abbots, and other sinister figures, each hiding secrets and ulterior motives”.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the citadel above lurks your jailor. After dying twice to a ghost dog in room 6, I do not want to know how many different shapes and colours of dice it takes to kill the Sorceror King. Perhaps I can persuade him to play checkers instead.
</p><p>
I flailingly compared The Fortress to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legend-of-grimrock">Legend of Grimrock</a> and Eye Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beholder">Beholder</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-hytale-quarantine-zone-a-weird-batman-sim-and-a-fresh-batch-of-rpgs-and-shooters">this week’s Maw</a>, but it seems a lot simpler so far – a steady, linear onslaught of fights with the occasional treasure room, and precious little to distract you from the throwing of the bones. The retro presentation is lovely: heaving, gaping, pixelated enemies and walls of bruised and abraded shadow. I’d say it’s worth a pop at the demo, at least, if you like the screens. The full game launches on Steam tomorrow.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has famously endured struggles when it comes to running well on PC since release. Capcom have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">tried relentlessly</a> to improve that situation, with varying results. Cue today, and a Reddit scientist coming to the conclusion that overtly aggressive DLC checks might be a key factor in the game's woes. Another modder has subsequently put out a work to combat the issue with the checks, but they reckon fixing this problem isn't necessarily a cure-all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">original thread</a> looking into these DLC checks was penned by Reddit user de_Tylmarande. Having played around with versions of the game on two Steam accounts - one with all of the Wilds' DLC bought and one running the DLC-less base version - they observed that the former seemed to benefit from better FPS numbers. Reaching the hypothesis that the discrepancies in frame rate they report experiencing in the two versions might be down to the DLC-less version of the game being throttled by regular behind-the-scenes checks as to which DLC was active, they did some testing.</p>
<p>"I quickly made a small 'mod' that made the game think I have all DLC present...And yes - performance went through the roof. Yes, without any CPU boost, in Balance mode. On any settings. The game literally flies," they wrote, emphasising that the mod was simply one that convinced the game they had all of the DLC installed, rather than actually giving them it. So, they said they've reached out to Capcom's support with their findings, suggesting "it's just a bug in the code they need to fix" rather than any maliciou bit of design.</p>
<p>Cool. Naturally, this being modders, one of their brethren has already looked into the situation and put out a work which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">limits Wilds' DLC checks</a> on Nexus Mods (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mchsumduun24">spotted</a> by friend of the Treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/dominic-tarason">Dominic Tarason</a>). According to this second modder, Vaeux, the DLC checks do seem to have some impact on performance, but only in certain areas of the game:</p>
<blockquote><p>As discovered by de_Tylmarande, who documented it in a Reddit thread, depending on which DLCs you own, Monster Hunter Wilds may perform dozens of checks for DLC ownership every frame. This can easily add up to thousands of (relatively) computationally-expensive checks every second, significantly reducing your framerate if it's bottlenecked by your CPU.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like this only happens when you're close enough to a Support Desk Felyne (the ones that handle bounties and have a DLC menu) to see an exclamation point on its map/world icon, which pops up if you purchase DLC, so you know to go and redeem your new DLC. So, it only matters while you're standing in/near a Base Camp. Not quite as game-changing as some were hoping, but better than nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll see whether Capcom, having seen all of this experimentation, end up being able to nail down any extra fixes/improvements to Wilds beyond what they've already done or <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">have planned</a>.</p>
