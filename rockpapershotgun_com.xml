            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/proton">Proton</a>, the compatibility software co-developed by Valve and CodeWeavers for helping Windows games run on Linux – and, thus, the foundation for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – is getting its first full version update in nearly a year. Proton 10.0 is now available in beta form, heralding compatibility fixes and improvements in enough games that I gave up bothering to do an accurate count. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-10.0-1b">Loads, basically</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Changes in this milestone update range from the addressing of specific issues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> Enhanced, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a> to the gift of SteamOS compatibility with games that previously lacked it entirely. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> Game of the Year Edition, which are currently listed as Unsupported for the Deck on their respective Steam pages – once Proton 10.0 gets a stable branch launch, those ratings may need to be reviewed. Indeed, when I set Arkham Asylum to run using the beta, it worked perfectly, having failed to get past the launcher on Proton 9.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck fixes in 10.0 either. The patch notes also promise amendments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> – among others – crashing on Intel GPUs, so the update has Linux-based desktop users in mind as well. Incidentally, Marvel Rivals had a less productive coming-together with Proton earlier this year, the software being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-unbans-steam-deck-and-mac-players-wrongly-caught-up-in-cheater-purge">mistakenly flagged as a cheating tool</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these fixes have been included in past updates to Proton Experimental, or were beaten to the punch by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a>: an unofficial, custom build that takes advantage of Proton’s open-sourcedness to pack in even more compatibility tweaks. Even so, Valve/CodeWeaver’s beta builds are inherently more polished and bug-light than Experimental versions, and unlike Proton GE, don’t need any side jaunts into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> to get working.</p>
<p>Between that readiness of use and the current lack of timeframe on when 10.0 might get a stable release, the beta is arguably worth trying out now if you’ve suffered any of the compatibility problems it claims to have sorted out. Proton beta versions also work on the stable branch of SteamOS, so you don’t need to switch to the operating system’s beta branch as well, and installation is a cinch: just search for the Proton 10.0 beta in your Steam library, and you can download it from there as if it were a game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been so long since the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a> that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space. I'm pretty sure at least one of those things is from some other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game universe. Maybe Worms. How long must we wait for a Starcraft 3? A long time yet, but possibly not forever, for Blizzard are apparently handing the rights to the cherished RTS series to Nexon, publisher of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean finance site <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (via Google translation) and written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/">PCGamer</a>, Nexon have been selected as the "preferred" candidate for Starcraft development rights following a bidding war with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publisher NCSoft, Solo Leveling: Arise creators Netmarble and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> outfit Krafton. Nexon are also, it's claimed, in the running to land Korean and Japanese service rights for a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> mobile game, referred to by some bidders as Overwatch 3, but in actuality a MOBA spin-off.</p>
<p>According to MTN, the bidders have pitched several new Starcraft concepts at Blizzard, ranging from spin-off games to "platforms", though it's not known what Nexon specifically proposed. Apparently, the negotiations have been "complicated" by the fact that while making a new RTS game is the obvious choice and doubtless the best usage of the license, nobody wants to go toe-to-toe with Blizzard's own Starcraft 2, which remains a huge hit in South Korea despite <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/608542-the-death-of-korean-sc2-and-where-we-go-from-here">reports of its "death" as an esport</a>. There's also been talk of a MOBA adaptation, as with Overwatch mobile. Good luck selling that to the Windows 98 diehards.</p>
<p>Why aren't Blizzard themselves making a new Starcraft RTS? Who knows, such a project may exist deep within the company, lost in a trove of Diablo 4 merchandise, but all they're talking about at present <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">is the latest Quixotic effort to make a Starcraft shooter</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
