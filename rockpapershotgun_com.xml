            <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year to some critical acclaim, and it has now made its way both west and onto PC. The PC version has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2731870/announcements/detail/4554919920318276609">bunch of graphical upgrades</a> and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC</a> - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ys X again stars pretty boy protagonist Adol, but this time is teamed-up with pirate Karja. Yes, that means there's ship-shaped exploration and combat. If you don't have a co-op buddy to play with, you can switch between both characters on the fly or control them together, and build their "Revenge Guage" to do combined attacks.

<p>The Ys series started all the way back in the '80, but it's been gaining in popularity in recent years, particularly on PC. Monstrum Nox was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/japanese-games-dominated-steams-july-top-sellers">a Steam best seller in July 2021</a>, and genre expert Nadia Oxford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">thought it was the perfect entrypoint to the series</a>. 
</p><p>I am yet to make my own entrance into the Ys series, and I confess, I've never fought a naval battle I've enjoyed. If I want to slowly circle an enemy I do not understand while taking potshots at it, then I will write news posts about RPG series I've never played, thanks. I do wish I had time to experience its blue skies and grappling hooks, though. Maybe if I ever finish Ni no Kuni. 
</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/">available from Steam</a>. It's £55/€60/$60 and there's a demo where your save can carry over to the full game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> received its final piece of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-cities-skylines-expansion-adds-hotels-and-tourist-resorts">last May</a>, as developers Colossal Order shifted their focus to its sequel, Cities: Skylines 2. Eighteen months and the release of Cities: Skylines 2 later... Cities: Skylines 1 is getting new DLC again.
</p>
<p>The "Mountain Village" creator pack add 45 new buildings designed to help you construct quaint and picturesque destinations.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Many of Cities: Skylines DLCs were created by community members and that's the case here, but developers Colossal Order have also been hands-off when it comes to implementing the work in-game.
</p>
<p>"We want to reassure those of you that play Cities: Skylines II, that the development of this new content for Cities: Skylines is an entirely separate effort. The content you’ll find in this release for Cities: Skylines has been implemented by Tantalus, the studio who managed the console ports for Cities: Skylines," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651">the pack's announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines II for this - our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines II. This approach allows us to release some updates without compromising on either game."
</p><p>Cities: Skylines 2 launched in a rough state last year, beset by both bugs and performance issues. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">There have been improvements since</a>, but still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">the first DLC pack was so poorly received</a> that players were refunded and everybody had to apologise.
</p>
<p>For those reasons, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">Paradox's many other recent missteps</a>, I think it'd be easy to view a return to Cities: Skylines DLC as a kind of retreat. I actually think this is great, though. A lot of people own and love the first Cities: Skylines and many can't move to the sequel even if they wanted to, so why shouldn't a publisher continue to serve that audience. More folks should do the same.
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2955870/Cities_Skylines__Content_Creator_Pack_Mountain_Village/">the Mountain Village creator pack from Steam</a>. The base game is 75% off, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I spent much of my time in the late '90s and early '00s downloading user-made levels for first-person shooters like Half-Life and the Quakes. Sometimes from Fileplanet, sometimes directly from whatever random dedicated server I'd just selected from the browser. These levels almost always had an incomplete grasp of the affordances of the game - or even more charitably, were more interested in gimmicks than in balance.
</p><p>What-ifs, basically. What if the level was just a big room with sight lines divided by pillars? What if there were no weapons on the level except for crossbows? What if the players started at opposite ends of a corridor with a single weapon in between them, a shotgun, which both have to race towards? What if players could reach a raised platform via a teleporter, and that was the only way up there, and there was, like, respawning grenades? What if a level sort of looked like that curtain room from Twin Peaks?
</p>
<p>I'm talking about the brutal teenaged logic that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">leads to fy_iceworld</a>. The answer to these questions is almost always: players will instantly find the unstoppable strategy, and the whole experience will become a race towards that unassailable position.
</p>
<p>Yet there remains an irresistible appeal to these levels. That's why they're gimmicks. 
</p>
<p>Straftat builds a framework around these sorts of levels that turns them effectively into Mario Party mini-games. Fights are always 1v1, two kills wins a round, and the first to five rounds wins the match. The levels are small and players are agile, able to perform bumslides, leans and mantling, meaning fights never last much longer than a minute. Being dominated in a fight? Don't worry, you'll be onto the next one in 90 seconds. Don't like a level? Don't worry, there are 70 of them and I'm yet to see the same one twice - and players can create playlists of their favourite maps.
</p><p>There's another experience from those halcyon days of server-hopping Straftat has recreated for me: that of making a single-server friend. I'm not going to lie, it takes some perseverence to find a Straftat match that doesn't immediately close when you join. (By which I mean, it takes a few minutes of clicking servers in the browser - and thus is still preferable to the oft-long queues of modern matchmaking.)
</p>
<p>When you do find someone to play with, I've often stayed with them for several matches in a row. There's proximity voice chat, but I'm yet to turn it on. Instead, when dumped into the post-match room in which a winner is declared, and in which music blares, every opponent and I have leaned and crouched at each other, in a celebratory manner I take to mean "Hello" and "Good game". 
</p>
<p>I've missed these dumb and oddly intimate moments with strangers, just as I've missed double-clicking on a server and excitedly wondering what daft .bsp world I was about to enter into. 
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">Straftat from Steam now</a>. It's completely free, although you can spend a few quid on a DLC that doubles the number of maps and adds some cosmetics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
