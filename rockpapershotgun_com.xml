I do not know if a black hole is something we should feed. Ostensibly they are things (anti-things? I'm not a black holeologist) that I would like to be far away from, given what I've heard. And yet here I am, having tinkered around with the demo for A Game About Feeding A Black Hole, which is a game about feeding a black hole, left with the feeling that this is not only a thing I can do, but find tranquility in.
</p>
<p>
The thing about A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is that it is more or less what it says on the tin. It is also a game about inaction and reaction. You have a tiny circle which every second or so, to start with, does a bit of damage. So, you break down the handful of asteroids you see around you, their remnants being swept up in the nothingness that is the black hole, trying to increase its size as the clock counts down.

<p>
This then gives you money, money which you can spend on a skill tree, a skill tree that can grow your circle, or strengthen it, or increase the length of the timer, or increase the mass of certain asteroids, or make some of them shoot out forks of lightning, or turn some of them radioactive, all of which works in tandem with one another. As your skills increase, so does your ability to destroy asteroids and feed the black hole, growing it in size incrementally. This is one of the reactions, as well as how a lightning bolt might hit another asteroid helping to destroy it, even more effectively on the radioactive rocks.
</p><p>
The inaction is the fact that all you really do is move your mouse around. After a while, in the demo, the game does half of the work for you, but oh that sweet satisfaction of seeing a plethora of numbers and destroyed bits of space boulders flying into deep, dark, nothingness. This is a game to spend perhaps 15 minutes on, the kind of thing you might do on a cigarette break during your shift at the busiest brunch spot in town, a way to get away and calm yourself down.
</p>
<p>
A Game About Feeding A Black Hole is also a game that came out today, December 15th, so for the price of a fancy pastry, you could instead, well… you know. It's available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694480/A_Game_About_Feeding_A_Black_Hole/">here</a>.

            <p>
Truth be told, I haven't played all that many games this year, who has the time! There was one I couldn't miss out on, however, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, the first properly new entry in the series for many years, and one with some pedigree behind it, Higurashi and Umineko writer Ryukishi07. I ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">reviewing it</a> for this here site, and liked it very much then, and perhaps more now. There were some great lessons to be learned, and in a recent interview, Ryukishi07 put some of those lessons into succinct, quite lovely words.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-f-writer-knows-you-dont-really-want-to-see-a-happily-ever-after-and-the-games-horrific-portrayal-of-young-womanhood-makes-it-my-goty/">GamesRadar</a>, the writer spoke of how each of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's characters, not just protagonist Hinako, but her parents, her friends, and the mysterious Fox Mask "may have had their own hell. Please do not forget that, or the fact that Hinako was oblivious to those hells, as she was too consumed by her own personal hell to notice." He continued to note how your own personal hell is "a world of solitude that no one else can perceive, but please do not fall into the trap of assuming that others around you have no hell of their own."
</p>
<p>
It's later on in the interview where Ryukishi07 says what I find most heartwarming, a strange feeling to have with something like Silent Hill. He discusses how he wants people to believe that whatever form of hell a person might be experiencing, it will come to an end one day. And according to him, "the key to the way out of your personal hell lies in the hands of your family, friends, or your local hotlines. You have endured through your personal hell so much. You have already persevered enough, so please, be proud of yourself, and rely on the help of others."
</p>
<p>
The hotlines part is possibly a touch hokey, but the overall spirit of the message is one I appreciate deeply. It is a message that is well woven into the game itself, and is borderline Kingdom Heartsian in its nature, a series that is perhaps diametrically opposed to Silent Hill in almost every regard. The feeling of comradery between Hinako and Shu is one of the best elements of the game, and it's reassuring to see the powerful narrative of the two relying on one another wasn't just a fluke.
</p><p>
I'd really recommend the full reader over at GamesRadar, as long as you're alright with some spoilers. I had little faith in Silent Hill f, and was proven wrong, so to see the love with which Ryukishi07 speaks of his creation is just nice to see.

            <p>
Right, shall we try again? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>! A game that was technically meant to be out by now, but is very obviously not out right now, is now a game that has a release month (no date, Bungie don't appear to be ready to share that one yet). That month is March, 2026, which I'm assuming has been chosen so that PlayStation manage to release one of their many promised but mostly cancelled live service games before the tax year wraps up.
</p>
<p>
This detail was confirmed in a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post</a> and mini documentary of sorts that Bungie have shared, the blog post also confirming a price point finally (sort of). They're apparently "targeting" $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 as a price point, with more regional pricing to come closer to launch. Obviously inexpensive compared to most big name games these days, but perhaps a barrier too high for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> mired in deeply mixed responses.

<p>
Anyway, I won't run through everything, but let me detail some of the new bits shown off in the documentary. Complaints about being forced to play with others have been heard, as the game will feature a solo queue. Proximity chat has also been confirmed, a feature I'm sure will afford many a slur to be said simply for playing with a toy.
</p><p>
A brief insight into factions were shown off, where you might be tasked with looting a bunch of guns, or blowing up a ton of stuff. These factions all have upgrade trees that grant you various boons, a point I am already yawning at. There's this thing called The Codex that stores all the bits of lore, including things like audio logs and the like. Which, as a point, surely bits like that will be such a run killer? I wonder how that'll work into terms of the actual gameplay. It'll all just fall flat if you're just sitting on a menu listening to the story the game isn't actually telling.
</p>
<p>
The most crushing element of all of this is just how beautiful Marathon continues to look. Inside it is a world I'm desperate to explore, and yet I know in my heart that the game's PvP elements, we all can sense will be a hotbed of toxicity, will put me off the thing entirely. Admittedly I am not the core audience, I don't play many shooters anyway, but hotdog do I like some bold sci-fi.
</p>
<p>
What I can't stop thinking about since watching the mini doc is the very last line from one of the game's devs: "It's a mad dash to finish, but that's when you got to put in the elbow grease and the extra sweat and blood that it takes to get this done." Blood has been spilled, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">figuratively</a>, to get this thing made, and all I can hope is that for some of those that remain, getting it out is worth it.
