            <p>Right, so. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">supposed to go</a> as follows: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-4-remaster">Yakuza 4 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-5">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>, then off into full-blown Like A Dragon land, and on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</a>. Easy. Except right now in my Steam library, it's not. The Kiwamis are cheekily lurking behind Yakuza 6, and the LADs are before all of their more Japanese gangsterly-named siblings.</p>
<p>It's chaos and anarchy. I can't live like this. The good news is that thanks to the update Steam's Client Beta has just gotten, it looks like I'll no longer have to.</p>

<p>"Added a customisation tab to game properties," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/545616353498759462?l=english">the notes</a> for it read, "The customisation tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library."</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://x.com/chibilawl/status/1951056729778823585">many</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1meelqh/theyre_finally_doing_it_oh_my_god/">many</a> folks who've been frustratedly looking at the alphabetically misbehaving names in their library letting out a big sigh of relief. To be clear, the custom name you add won't overwrite the game's display name in your library, it's just hidden away behind-the-scenes, letting the storefront's inner workings know not to put 2016's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> above 2013's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of that, this Client Beta update's all about useful but unglamourous fixes for various issues you might run into when Steaming. Some are specifically aimed at big picture mode, recording games, and Linux, with a good chunk of them being interface-related.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top genres list in the store menu should now be "more relevant and dynamic", which I assume means you'll know in an instant if Steamers all over the world suddenly get way more into shmups.</p>
<p>If you've taken one look at the new sorting powers on offer and are currently salivating at the prospect of getting your librarian on, instructions to opt into the Client Beta can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order]]></content:encoded>
