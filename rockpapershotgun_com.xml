            <p>Ubisoft today revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">year one update roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> weather-appreciate-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. It includes a steady drip feed of new quest and story updates, some fan requested features like NG+, and a few additional quality of life bits. However! None of this matters. Shoo, less important details. The real headline here is that the series built around making jumping between rooftops feel good is making jumping between rooftops feel even better. Excellent news.</p>

<p>I'll admit that this is probably a very personal thing, but I'm often left confused watching Ubisoft pour energy into dozens of supplementary features over the years, while seemingly neglecting what I see as Assassin's Creed's core fantasy. The parkour traversal that felt so key to the series' identity in the early years has gradually turned into a frictionless, ho-hum means of traversal, absent all the thrills and creativity it has the potential to offer. Make climbing on things fun, and everything else falls into place, say I.</p>
<p>The first update is coming in May, where Ubi say they'll be adding "often-requested height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a brand-new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump, allowing both characters to jump and grab onto awnings and lower overhangs â€“ a move that is particularly handy when wall-runs are not an option". They'll also be adding "more little parkour tricks" and tweak over the year.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other bits on the roadmap, too, including a higher difficulty setting and other regular community feedback updates. It's nice to listen to fans, even if I can't help picturing <a href="https://youtu.be/yGsHq-mZI8U">The Simpsons' Itchy and Scratchy focus group</a> whenever a developer goes to these sort of community-appeasing lengths.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">recent round of layoffs at Respawn parent company EA</a> reportedly lead to around 300 to 400 job losses, plus cancellations of two incubation projects. It's since come out that one of those projects was likely an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe, codenamed 'R7'. This joins an unannounced single player<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unannounced-single-player-titanfall-game-has-been-cancelled-by-ea"> Titanfall game cancelled in 2023</a>, alongside the perpetually rumoured but yet-to-materialise Titanfall 3. It has, in brief, been a rough <em>forever </em>to be a fan of Respawn's exciting mix of parkour shooting and mech piloting combat.</p>
<p>But what's this? Nestled in the replies to this good<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/headfallsoff.com/post/3lnxved4uwc25"> Bluesky post</a> lies the promise of a mechful consolation prize. "Oopsie I dropped this legally distinct fan project," writes Diesel Knights developer Xavier B. Johnson, alongside one of those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2785740/Diesel_Knights/">Steam links I know you all enjoy</a>. "Diesel Knights is a 6-v-6, Mech/Movement Shooter set in a pulp-inspired, dieselpunk world", and you can request access to the upcoming playtest right now.</p>

<p>"Stunningly rendered for the first time in dazzling full color! Join us now for these treacherous tales of the dauntless Diesel Knights and their fearsome fighting machines," reads Steam. "Utilize verticality and momentum to outmaneuver your opponents in all new first or third person multiplayer action or compete for the fastest time in the time trial mode".</p>
<p>Everything's pre-alpha at the moment, but I do still enjoy the rusty charm of the "mid-century inspired weapons and gadgets". This one's published by Philadelphia collective Keyframe Crew, who previously worked on this <a href="https://www.habitheque.com/an-otter-planet">nice game about space otters</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
