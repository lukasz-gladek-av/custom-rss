            <p>Warner Bros. Games have enacted some corporate-mandated chair-rejigging after shuttering three studios earlier this year. The company are now divided into four divisions that'll be focusing on the four game series they want to do stuff with.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">Variety</a>, these four bits will focus on making games about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, Mortal Kombat, the DC Universe, and the wizard that I'm not going to bother naming.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Warner Bros Games Montr√©al head Yves Lachance has been tapped to oversee the making of Game of Thrones and unnamed wizard games as a senior vice president, while NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick is getting a similar promotion to look after games involving a bit of Mortal Kombat or DC superheroes.</p>
<p>This rejigging, Warner Bros exec JB Perrette says, is all about "optimising our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps", which is definitely some words. It follows Warner Bros. Games shutting down Monolith, Player First Games, and Warner Bros Games San Diego <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">back in February</a>, resulting in an unspecified number of job losses.</p>
<p>At that time, Warner Bros. indicated that this circling of the wagons around what they'd identified as their four golden geese was its plan going forwards, following a big live-service push that hadn't delivered the sorts of returns games industry execs look for in that sort of thing. Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League ended up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">the poster child</a> of the company's ill-fated efforts to go in that direction, which were followed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">departing</a> at the start of this year.</p>
<p>At the time it was closed, Monolith - developers of games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-one-lives-forever">No One Lives Forever</a>, F.E.A.R, and the Nemesis system having  - had been working on a Wonder Woman game which had reportedly suffered a troubled development and was cancelled alongside the studio shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Player First Games' Multiversus <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/">shut its online doors</a> last month, and you can on longer buy it on the few storefronts that it hasn't been totally erased from as part of that process.</p>
<p>Going forwards, Warner Bros. Games have already committed to making a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/">wizard game sequel</a>, and debuted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-reveal-game-of-thrones-rts-starring-the-lannisters-starks-targaryens-and-night-king">Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</a> at the Keighleyfest just gone. They'll be the first of what WB execs will hope resembles a wave of hits to get out of some rough financial waters. It was also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report">hinted earlier this year</a> that letting Rocksteady go back to single-player was a thing that could happen, which would in theory be a shred of good news amid all the bad that's come of WB's strategy over the past few years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
