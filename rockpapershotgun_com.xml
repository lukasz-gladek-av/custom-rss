There are two reasons you shouldn't watch the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep's</a> just announced DLC Siren's Rest. The first is that, well, it'll probably spoil at least some of the events of the base game given that the expansion is set more than a decade on. The other is for the subset of you that have just the worst case of submechanophobia, because the trailer is absolutely full of man-made objects under water. You've been warned, don't come crying to me if you don't heed me, I'll just say I told you so.

So! Where the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game takes place on an oil rig in 1975, Siren's Rest stays in the same location but moves forward an entire 11 years. With a new cast, you'll be sent to the North Sea to see what's become of the Beira D, using tools like a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera to try and figure out what happened to the crew that manned it. "But beware," a press release teases, "there are things lurking in the depths that even the sea cannot claim." Scary!

Previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> narrative designer Sagar Beroshi has penned Siren's Rest, with Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who) coming aboard as its protagonist Mhairi. She's joined by Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton) and David Menkin (Final Fantasy 16, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>) in as of yet unnamed roles.

It's also out really soon! In less than a week in fact, as it's due to be released June 18th, next Wednesday. Doesn't sound too bad for something that essentially sounds like a mini sequel.
