You would think that being able to take on 14 different jobs would be enough to keep most people busy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, but to Level-5 it seems like that won't be enough. Last month, the developer announced that because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has done so well, they'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc">releasing a free update/ bit of DLC called Update the World</a>, and they've now offered a couple of details as to what that'll be.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Apparently, it'll be a "roguelike open world" mode, which mostly just sounds like a bit of an awkward translation, but the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">post</a> detailing the mode did explain it a touch at least: "The update will feature an evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements that offers engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." So, kind of what it says on the tin honestly. No details were shared as to how the mode will work, but there will be some new gear, equipment, mounts, hairstyles, emotes, and "unusual items".
</p>
<p>
A bit of character art featuring an evil, wizardy looking big dog creature with a mysterious set of cases attached to their back was also shown off. This new character will arrive with the update, and "plays a pivotal role in the story and is set to leave a significant mark on the world." Kind of love Level-5 just dropping a PNG of some guy almost completely contextlessly.
</p>
<p>
The team is apparently "actively working" on all this new stuff, but there's no release date in sight for it just yet. Considering how big that game is though, I'm sure you've got more than enough to be getting on with in the meantime.

            <p>
Match-3 games are probably the purest out there, at least in terms of genre. They are so instantly understandable by pretty much anyone, no wonder there's a seemingly infinite number of them available on our phones. The issue is that most of them can't match up to the heights of a classic like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, though at least every once in a while we get delightful spins on the genre like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spirit-swap">Spirit Swap</a>. Now, there's a new, quite tiny new kid on the block in the form of Sinister Sodies, a match-3 game where you set out to "purify your carbonated concoction before time runs out."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Sinister Sodies has the usual thing you'll find in a match-3 game, i.e. different coloured tiles you have to match up. The particular spin here is that rather than like in other games in the genre where you might move a tile to get a match, you have to box specific combinations of three tiles in by drawing a four-cornered box.

It sounds simple enough, but there's a fast-paced time limit, so in the first instance you have to find a spot that includes your three target tiles before you can even match them up. This gets complicated by things like tiles that explode if you draw a line through them, more and more of said tiles appearing as you make matches. 
</p>
<p>
I really like this little twist on the genre, there's a snappiness to it thanks to the timer that really helps it to feel satisfying when you just manage to make a match. Not enough to make you want to play it for hours on end, but I can see myself coming back to this for five minutes pop when I need a break from writing about the latest Fortnite update or whatever it is games journalists do these days.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I'm most fond of is the presentation. It all looks like a piece of claymation, rendered in artist Crisppyboat's own signature style. I feel like it's a game that would have fit very well on Cartoon Network's Flash games site back when that was still a thing. Real "killing time on the family computer while your mum is getting ready for the school run" kind of vibe in the most positive of ways possible.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3752580/Sinister_Sodies/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://goblin-laundromat.itch.io/sinister-sodies">itch.io</a>, and it's cheap as chips, so you've not got much of an excuse to not get it honestly.

            <p>
Crytek had a little bit of an oopsie yesterday with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown 1896's</a> 2.4 update yesterday. As soon as it arrived, there were reports of server problems and issues with buying Blood Bonds. This led to Crytek trying to fix it, taking the game's servers offline to do so, except when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was brought back online, it wasn't with a fixed version of the new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859005?l=english">but version 2.3</a>. However! It looks like the team continued work on getting it fixed (hope you didn't have to crunch too hard, Crytek staff), and the update is back and available to download.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Our team has been working tirelessly to resolve the issues that followed the original rollout, and after extensive testing and final checks, weâ€™re confident in this new release," Crytek explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859184?l=english">Steam post</a>. "Weâ€™ll continue monitoring stability closely and remain committed to delivering the best possible experience moving forward." For what it's worth, now that the update is live and stable, <a href="https://x.com/HuntShowdown/status/1935431568409116845">you'll be able to redeem a code for 10,000 Hunt dollars as compensation</a> (I'd also like to take a second to note how funny Hunt dollars is as a name, couldn't figure out anything else huh).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the actual content of the update, also called the Judgement of the Fool update, it goes as follows: there's a new area called The Fool's Hideout to explore, where you can use Pledge Marks to unlock Sealed Rewards. The map DeSalle is back too, "revitalized with significant enhancements." 
</p>
<p>
There's a new Catalyst Trait too, which "unlocks powerful Conditional Trait Effects for specific Traits when theyâ€™re equipped on your Hunter." And there's also The Brute, a "formidable offspring of Ursa Mortis" that is stealthy in nature, so keep your wits about you. You can read more about the update in a blog post <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/update-24-judgement-of-the-fool-live-now">here</a>.
