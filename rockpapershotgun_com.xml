            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A battle between three former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developers and their publishers at Krafton intensified over the weekend, after an internal document appeared online showing how the scope of the survival game has reduced during development. The source of this document remains unknown. In fact, quite a lot of facts about the document remain unknown. Nevertheless, Krafton have since leapt at the chance to confirm its authenticity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>For those new to the drama, Subnautica 2 is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. A couple of weeks ago three senior management folks at studio Unknown Worlds were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out and replaced</a> by the head of another Krafton-owned studio. The three ousted developers were co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, alongside CEO Ted Gill. No explanation was given, but Cleveland later revealed he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">disagreed with the publisher</a> over whether the game was ready to be released or not. He said Subnautica 2 was ready for early access. Krafton did not agree.</p>
<p>Then a report by Bloomberg revealed the leviathan in the room: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million payout</a> that Unknown Worlds employees would receive if a released game sold sufficient copies by the end of 2025. Following the leadership coup Krafton announced they would delay the game until 2026, making this "earnout" impossible. The fired managers then filed a lawsuit against Krafton, and Krafton in return released a statement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">accusing those managers of being negligent</a>. The whole thing is very messy.</p>
<p>This weekend it got messier. On Friday, two slides from a presentation of unknown length were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">posted to Reddit</a> by an unknown party. The slides seem to show how the scope of the game's features were reduced over a two year period. It claims that the game was "deemed to lack the level of polish" required for release. </p>

<p>"Compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications," says one line, "the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap."</p>
<p>It's not unusual for games to have features stripped away during development, but this is the exact point on which Krafton and the fired developers disagree. Krafton confirmed the authenticity of this presentation in a statement to RPS and many other press outlets.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project," the statement reads, adding that milestone reviews "are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON’s creative studios across all projects.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to
confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate
communication with players must take precedence."</p>
<p>For all Krafton's talk of transparency, there is an astounding amount of information we do <em>not</em> know about this document. The document is incomplete. There is no date or timestamp to show when it was written. There is no attribution to show who originally authored it. It does not show who the intended recipient of the document is (ie. was this written to be sent to Unknown Worlds, or was it written to be shared between parties within Krafton?). The identity of the person or persons who posted the document is not known: it came from Reddit account "Complete_Bread_4924", who has made no other posts or comments.  </p>

</figure>
<p>What we can say is that Krafton stand to benefit from its appearance, inasmuch as it supports their side of the narrative about Subnautica 2's delay. They have confirmed the slides are authentic in their statement to the press - itself a practice that is rare for companies when it comes to leaks. Given this unusual development, and the speculation it might raise, we have asked Krafton, via their PR, several questions about the origin of the document.</p>
<p>We have asked Krafton to confirm or deny that they are the source of this leak. We also asked what date the document was authored, among other questions. They have so far answered by resending us the press release quoted above. We'll let you know if they get back to us with anything more solid. </p>
<p>The games media has broadly been attempting to keep up with the fast pace of this implosive fracas, and to understand the facts about the story. Krafton hasn't been particularly helpful. The publishers say that under the circumstances, "transparent communication is necessary". However, they have chosen only to show a tiny fragment of the internal discussion around the game, inviting onlookers and the media to make more judgements and speculation about what happened. Krafton jumping on this suggests that they believe the slides will help them further their version of events.</p>
<p>As for the ousted developers, they have retreated firmly into lawyer mode and are no doubt weighing up the likelihood of a victory against the corporate giant. "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list," said Cleveland last week. "But this needs to be made right." </p>
<p>So what do we take away from all this? The confirmation of the slides' authenticity feels distinctly like another angry volley from Krafton, directed at Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. Krafton would undoubtedly rather avoid a lengthy legal dispute about the game, especially considering the $250 million payout being disputed. Whether that loud noise is enough to scare the ousted developers remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Romanian MEP Nicolae Ștefănuță says he's signed the initative's petition to EU lawmakers</p>

    </div>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the European Parliament's vice presidents has voiced his support for the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, and said he's signed the group's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable by shutting down their servers.</p>
<p>The petition surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">recently</a>, though there are concerns that some of the signatories are fake. It has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">received some pushback</a> from bodies representing game publishers, so it's no surprise the organisers have welcomed an endorsement from Nicolae Ștefănuță.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/nicustefanuta">Ștefănuță</a> voiced his support for Stop Killing Games via his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicustefanuta/#">Instagram story</a> over the weekend, writing: "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative. I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>If you don't keep up with EU politics on a daily basis, Nicolae Ștefănuță is a Romanian MEP currently representing the left-leaning Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He's also one of the legislative body's fourteen vice-presidents, having been elected to that position in July last year.</p> <div>

<p>These <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/faq/13/who-are-the-meps-in-key-functions-and-how-are-they-elected">vice-presidents</a> work underneath the EU Parliament's president - right now that's Maltese politician Roberta Metsola - and may be asked to fill in for them by doing stuff like chairing debates. They're also part of "The Bureau", which sounds a lot cooler than it is, that being the thing which oversees the rules and admin that keep the parliament running efficiently.</p>
<p>So, certainly the kind of person that could help make the case for Stop Killing Games in debates, but still just one guy that's part of a wider body currently made up of 720 MEPs in total. If you're keen to learn more about Ștefănuță, who's been an MEP since 2019, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/58766/NICOLAE_STEFANUTA/home#detailedcardmep">his profile</a> on the EU Parliament's website. It includes <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html">videos</a> of what he's said in plenary debates.</p>
<p>For instance, last Wednesday, July 9th, he was discussing lessons that could be taken from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/budapest-pride-viktor-orban-far-right-lgbtq">Budapest's recent pride parade</a> amid a crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, in terms of the need for anti-discrimination laws and "defending fundamental rights against right-wing attacks".</p>
<p>We'll have to see how many other EU politicians opt to get behind Stop Killing Games, but it's clear MEPs are becoming aware that they need to engage with the issue and work out where they stand.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Morning all! The working week once again looms above us like a bulldozer driven by raucous and somehow loveable sheepdogs in top hats and cufflinks. Quickly now, lob a few new PC game releases under the caterpillar treads to slow its passage. It's not clear where those sheepdogs are going, but your and my wellbeing are clearly of secondary importance.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 14th July</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Tuesday 15th July</h2>

<h2>Thursday 17th July</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">The Necromancer's Tale</a> (pictured) is an open world RPG with Disco Elysium-esque dialogue windows in which you are a questing liche (quiche?), building up your rotten retinue (rotinue?

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3343160/Fill_Up_The_Hole/">Fill Up The Hole</a> is a chirpy 2D landfill empire simulator. Can't spell wholesome without hole, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> attempts to make a horror game out of Pac-Man, overlooking that Pac-Man is already perfectly horrible. Pac-Man, a game in which you are an insatiable orb in a maze of ghosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-drifter">The Drifter</a> could be this week's highlight. It's a pulp adventure joint inspired by "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse", in which you a homeless man asked to investigate his own murder.</li>

<p>What are we denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, Nic and Jeremy spent a lot of this week's all-hands meeting complaining about gardening - possibly gardening in a video game. I can't quite remember, because I was myself too busy complaining about the 1990s. Possibly the 1990s in a videogame - again, I can't quite remember. This happens a lot at the minute. </p>
<p>Mark has some embargoed stuff on the boil, and James is just back from break, freshly bronzed and hungry for words. Ollie is tidying up some bits and pieces before he, too, embarks on holiday. Graham is staring at us all patiently from the corner of the video call, waiting for people to shut up about their roots. What are you up to this week? Assuming you haven't been smooshed by sheepdogs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-stronghold-destiny-and-neverwinter-nights-lead-a-host-of-drifters-necromancers-and-pac-monsters]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s gotten a randomiser mod, just in case the base game isn't quite maxing out your unexpected chaos-per-run meter at this point, despite its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">revamped bosses</a>.</p>
<p>While FromSoft's roguelike-ish twist on the established souls formula already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">switches things up</a> in a manner that's a bit like a randomiser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-mods">mod</a> makeover of one of the series' traditional entries, modder thefifthmatt has still found ways to tinker with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/277?tab=description">Nightreign randomiser and derandomiser</a>, which can be used to scramble map layouts beyond what's possible in the base game, which has a finite range of different map patterns it can chuck at you per Nightlord. It's a first foray into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> randomising that the author says will serve as a "basis for more advanced randomisation" down the line.</p>
<p>"At a base level, the only difference you might notice using the randomizer is that Night Bosses are more varied for a given Nightlord," thefifthmatt wrote. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements. In the future this can be extended to randomising enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customisation."</p>
<p>The randomiser works by modifying files when you start up the game, and comes with three distinct randomness presets, "similar to base game", "balanced random", "extra random". They all basically do what they say on the tin, with "balanced" looking like the one you'll want to try first, while "extra" ditches some "placement restrictions which are normally helpful for balancing purposes" to make things tougher for uber-hardcore folks.</p>
<p>You can also pick "any custom combination of these options or other options like greatly increasing the frequency of double Night Bosses". Plus, thefifthmatt's chucked in extra options like increasing the chance of shifting earth being a factor or reverting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-its-first-patch-but-more-importantly-a-trailer-thatll-really-help-you-wake-up">patch 1.01's tweaks</a> to runes and revives so uber-sweaty solo players can wind back the clock to a time of enhanced hardness.</p>
<p>Not every aspect of the maps has been made randomness-eligible yet, but as the modder says, it's a start, and one that's compatible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">Nightreign's Seamless Co-op mod</a> so you can dive in with however many buddies you like. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab <a href="https://me3.help/en/latest/">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling]]></content:encoded>

<p>All told, the full package contains four campaigns and nine factions, namely Orks, Eldar, Spicy Eldar, Space Marines, Spicy Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tau, Necrons, and Sisters Of Battle. Tyranids were never released, but you have to remember this was 2004, and the idea of having a swarming species of hive-minded purple bug aliens in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> was ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of multiplayer, Relic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">say they've</a> been "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs", though balance will remain the same. They also plan to hang around for a bit after launch to fix "high priority issues", and experiment with with changes to things like flying unit behaviour, unit pathing, and "quality-of-life settings such as grid key presets".</p>
<p>As for general improvements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of Phwoar, That's A Lot Of War(hammer) edition features: image-based lighting, unit texture upscaling ("at least four times their original resolution), new world lighting, unit reflections, surface gloss, emissive lighting, and new shadows. There's also an integrated mod manager, an "improved camera", better draw distances, 4K support, and a better HUD for widescreen.</p>
<p>There is apparently a very minor controversy going on over the new trailer (above) replacing a Space Marine's scream. The word 'iconic' has been used. This does not bother me, because everything that has ever come out of a Space Marine's mouth is stupid, and the setting would be vastly improved if you replaced it all with goat noises. Although, as an Ork enjoyer, I realise I'm throwing stones from the glassiest of houses here.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-gets-an-august-release-date-with-a-chunky-discount-for-anniversary-owners]]></content:encoded>
