            <p>This week in new PC games: some new PC games. Look, sometimes I have the energy and fortitude to write a 500 word overture about four dimensional tapeworms, and sometimes I look upon the intro as nothing but a hateful chore. I just want to list some games, but internet etiquette requires that I occupy your eyeballs with a proper paragraph or two before we break out the bullet points.</p>
<p>Is this enough of a preamble yet? No? How about now? Come ooooon, there’s a tasty new tactics RPG at the bottom of the page. Scroll down, you apes!</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 2nd February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Come parry an arrow or two in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216340/Tearscape/">Tearscape</a>, a top-down 2D action-RPG with single screen combat puzzles, a catacombic world, and art direction inspired by the Game Boy Color.</li>
<li>Come strafe a carrier or two in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1219770/Arvoch_Alliance_SE/">Arvoch Alliance SE</a>, a spruced-up version of a nicely crunchy mission-based space dogfighter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 3rd February</h2>
<ul>
<li>In sci-fi short <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352050/SECTOR_ZERO/">SECTOR ZERO</a> you are the avatar of a grumpy space-bound hivemind woken up by pesky human asteroid drillers. Explore the newly excavated passages and corrupt the invader's gadgets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 4th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you hated Silksong's diagonal pogo you may wince over parts of the trailer for precision platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925120/The_Pale_Piper/">The Pale Piper</a>, but you might also whistle at the shadowy and decaying backdrops.
</li><li>The latest spin on Lethal Company's drudgecore extraction romp format is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">YAPYAP</a>, in which you and up to four others play wizard's minions invading another wizard's tower. Cast spells using your actual mouth and try to avoid the escaped magical experiments.</li>
<li>Time for some point-and-click pulp as detectives Foster and Whitman dare to behold <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566870/The_Dark_Rites_of_Arkham/">The Dark Rites Of Arkham</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 5th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>In quantum logic puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219580/Theta_and_Paralldox_on_Worldlines/">Theta and Paralldox on Worldlines</a> you control a girl who turns left when she hits a wall and can use a tuning fork to duplicate herself. Much heart-warming cleverness results.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">PUBG: Blindspot</a> (early access) is a top-down, 5v5 shooter with Rainbow Six Siege-style fortification mechanics and yes, a big emphasis on blindspots. </li>
<li>It's time to take the Battle Brothers formula to other planets in turn-based merc-mulcher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2432860/MENACE/">Menace</a> (early access).</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2408350/Hermit_and_Pig/">Hermit and Pig</a> is a truffle-hunting RPG that also features corporations, conversations and anxiety.
</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499860/DRAGON_QUEST_VII_Reimagined/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> drags the old PS1 RPG kicking and screaming into the realm of individually modelled 3D teeth.</li>
<li>If you haven't rampaged through a garishly painted 1970s casino in simply forever, here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124230/Jackal/">Jackal</a> with some "unlockable drug superpowers".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 6th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>You thought you had made it to the weekend with your butt in one piece, but here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">Nioh 3</a> tucked behind a corner wearing katana-heel shoes. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712100/Carmageddon_Rogue_Shift/">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a> is a post-apocalyptic zombie roguelite take on the elderly motor-mangling series.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we of the Treehouse doing this week? Well, <em>somebody</em>'s reviewing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, and the very best of luck to them. I think a few people have designs on the Menace early access launch, because we are nothing if not partial to playing footsie with mechs. Possibly a desperate soul will find time for Plunkbat Siege as well - I quite like how the walls fall apart. Anyway, let me know if there's a cool game out this week that has unaccountably evaded our eagle's eye.</p></div>
