            <p>On Monday, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme revealed the good news that he'd followed through on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">saying he'd chat</a> to Riot Games about buying the rights to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights</a> to said game. Now, with an independent team back working on the game following the closure of its<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">original studio</a>, Collins-Laflamme and co have shared a 16 minute look at what Hytale's currently like to play.</p>

<p>The snippet shows off some exploring and enemy battling, with the game's world in its survival-esque exploration mode currently looking straightforwardly hostile and dungeon crawly. You run around, you collect materials by hitting things, then you hit the likes of skeletons before they hit you. The biomes look nicely varied and visually interesting given where the game's at right now, especially when the light fades, allowing certain fauna or weather effects to coat the area in an atmospheric coloured glow. The combat and climbing animations also look very fluid and snazzy.</p>
<p>"I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts," Collins-Laflamme wrote in the video's description. "One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all. Stay tuned, Cursebreakers. More is coming."</p><p>According to that same description, this snippet is "the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again", and was "recorded in a single morning and put together by Collins-Laflamme. "No bells or whistles," the blurb adds. "Just the game as it is. Raw and broken, but still beautiful."</p>
<p>As you might expect given this showcase has come so soon after the announcement of Hytale changing hands, there's no fresh update on when its promised early access launch is due or how much it'll cost you to grab. Though, Collins-Laflamme's been clear the team plan to show off more of the game and has delivered on that right out of the gate, so for now there seems no reason to doubt your patience in giving the devs time to finalise those key details won't be rewarded soon.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have delivered a timely reminder that AI isn’t just effective at injecting ugly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">soulless</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">anti-art</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-player-convinces-one-of-the-games-npcs-theyre-pregnant-with-his-baby">nonsense robochat</a> into your games – it also has the power to ruin your entire PC.</p>
<p>MS recently <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">updated a support article</a> explaining the 'agentic AI' features they plan to roll out for Windows 11, which involve creating a separate desktop instance and allowing AI 'agents' to perform supposedly menial tasks (like file sorting and email sending) within it. All while you kick back on your main workspace, online shopping for the third yacht that the AI revolution has surely enabled you to afford. Unfortunately, among the agents’ capabilities is the risk of installing malware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, the article warns that agentic AI may "introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.” Sounds awful. Terrible! Clearly not the kind of vulnerability that Microsoft could possibly allow to stand and oh no wait they’re going through with it anyway, with the first experimental versions already being live via the Windows Insider programme.</p>
<p>There are token safeguards: the 'agent workspace' is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by someone with admin privileges. But it’s hardly reassuring when the only way to use these features safely is to <em>not</em> use them, at all. And you would stay at effectively zero risk of XPIA attacks if you didn't, as these types of malware are engineered to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">target large language models</a> (LLMs) rather than humans.</p><p>It’s likely inevitable that Windows 11 will swell up with agentic AI at some point; Microsoft have been talking about it for months, and with Windows 10 having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">lost (of all things) its security updates</a>, it’s not like fleeing to the older OS is a long-term alternative. But putting it in users’ hands when the AI involved hasn’t been sufficiently trained to avoid obvious, often plain-English phishing or malware injection scams is <em>spectacular</em> arrogance. Unless it’s some kind of Valve inside job to make us all buy SteamOS-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machines</a>, but I’m not sure their wheelie desks would roll that far.</p>
<p>Motoring critics often use the phrase "Car Brain" to illustrate how otherwise rational, sensible drivers suddenly lose their empathy and perception functions as soon as they sit behind a steering wheel. I’d like to propose the usage of "AI Brain" to describe the phenomena of ostensibly intelligent technologists instantly abandoning any sense of responsibility, creativity, good product design, and in many cases, basic human decency the minute they have artificial intelligence in front of their face. AI Brain can be easily identified through symptoms such as excessive LinkedIn posting and the vocalisation of gibberish about how their company <em>needs</em> to steal other people’s work, actually.</p>
