            <p>What is the half-life of comedy? WRONG. Comedy is a vibe, not a substance, you buffoon. I know this because I am a man of science. I have played survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> for an unspecified number of hours, and have learned many things. Most recently, I learned that the developers are releasing it from early access peer review today, but the shiny version 1.0 comes with a few notes scribbled hastily in the margins. If you already have a save file and don't want to lose any pet mutants you've trained, you might want to read on. </p>

<p>"Before you update your save to the new 1.0 version, please take your Pests out of their Pest Traps and Pest Wheels!" developers Deep Field Games warn in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085900698">a guide to upgrading your save</a>. "Pests in cages or wheels will be lost so be sure to set them out to roam before updating!"</p>
<p>Pests, for those uninitiated, are slimy cross-dimensional maggot things that normally attack you, but can be subdued and turned into pets, which is an anagram of "pest". Is rearranging letters an indivisible element of comedy? We do not yet know. Further research is required.</p>
<p>Anyway, the warning above is just one small note in a handy guide that details how much the update is likely to affect players' existing worlds. Mostly, your base, character and story progress will be fine. But pets seem to have proven tricky to cross over. Soups too.</p>
<p>"Due to some changes in how we store soup data (now stored in a better, cleaner way) existing pots full of soup that have been placed in the world will all be turned into Pest Goulash," say the devs. Yes, you do also chop up and eat the pests.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you're coming into Abiotic Factor as a new player none of this will be a problem. Likewise if you intend to restart from the beginning, something which the developers gently suggest is a good option. </p>
<p>"Starting a new world save when 1.0 lands will give you a more 'intended' playthrough with more tools at your disposal," says design director Geoff "Zag" Keene, "but if you don’t want to do that, that’s fine too. I’m not going to make you do anything. I’m not your dad."</p>
<p>Thanks dad - I mean Zag. Whichever way you come at this, you're in for a good time if you slurp often upon survival games. Abiotic Factor was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a> just on the strength of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> adjacent sense of humour. As for the future of the blood-spattered labratory explorer, the devs are "already working on ABF’s next update plans" and promise that it'll continue to see "bug fixes, quality of life improvements and general support". </p>
<p>Version 1.0 is due to come out today at 6pm BST, aka 1pm EDT. Please don't ask me to type out any more time zones. I'm not World Time Buddy. Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085904750">a map with all the release times</a> from the developer. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scientifically-funny-survive-em-up-abiotic-factor-is-hitting-version-10-today-and-your-pets-are-in-danger]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developers Spiders are going ahead with a layoff plan that'll see "most" of their animating and rigging team affected, according to a post from a lead animator at the Nacon-owned studio.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/">LinkedIn post</a> by Erwan Perrin, whose profile cites him as having been a permanent Spiders staffer since 2021, has been reposted by at least four other workers at the the studio.</p>

<p>"We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected," Perrin wrote. As of writing, Spiders gameplay animator Lucas Dubois, game designer Antoine Dieulesaint, game animator Raphaël Brousseau, and dialogue artist Yaseen Lalmahomed are among those who've reposted the message.</p>
<p>It's currently unclear how many staff have been affected by these alleged cuts. We've reached out to Spiders for comment.</p>

<p>Spiders released Greedfall 2 into early access last September, with the game's reviews sitting at mixed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/">Steam</a> as of writing. Shortly before that release, 44 of Spiders' 95 workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-developers-call-a-strike-over-working-conditions-lack-of-gender-equality-and-parity-and-global-mismanagement">signed an open letter</a> calling for a strike over working conditions and wider management practices at the studio. Among the issues cited were "global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations".</p>
<p>Spiders responded by saying that these were "false and even defamatory accusations" which "in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's employees", adding that the studio's management were "committed to open and constructive social dialogue". Subsequent negotiations between Spiders and the French union representing the staff, the Syndicat des Travailleurs/ses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spiders-release-fantasy-rpg-greedfall-2-in-early-access-as-its-frustrated-workers-are-offered-concessions">look to have yielded</a> some promises that the workers would recive an "audit" of their working conditions, as well as bonuses based on Greedfall 2's performance in early access.</p>
<p>This year's been a particularly brutal one in terms of layoffs across the games industry, with Oblivion Remastered co-developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-developers-virtuos-are-reportedly-planning-layoffs-with-300-workers-at-risk">Virtuos</a> being among the companies which have recently thrown workers into the void. Here's hoping that if Spiders devs are being let go, they can land on their feet.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-studio-spiders-set-for-layoffs-thatll-affect-most-of-their-animators-and-riggers-dev-claims]]></content:encoded>
