            <p>In these days of combing online imagery for symptoms of genAI “hallucination”, it’s easy to forget that once upon a time, mutant video game visuals were beautiful. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">a whole genre of art</a> dedicated to them. Here to remind us is Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal, a gorgeously scruffy 2D platformer in which an old lady explores a big magic cellar, hitting graphics card malfunctions with a broom. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, but both you and the simulation aren’t as young as you used to be.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal is the work of Jakeonaut, who is <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/">partial</a> to busted pixels. It launched on Saturday and still has a demo on Steam, which I encourage you to try. The world is made up of fizzy, marbled terrain tiles, wavering clots of white noise, and anomalous 3D fixtures. It's like the game's carcass is being feasted on by a bunch of different aesthetics. More literally, the geography also teems with critters such as frogs, crickets and chickens who can be meddled with to various end. I walloped a cricket and it chewed a hole through some scenery for me, which almost never happens in real life.</p>

<p>The protagonist is no less delightful for her determinedly low-tech method of making headway. Ah, if only I could fix my old iBook’s addled GPU by smacking it with a dustpan and brush. Mind you, it's not all flailing broomsticks. You can also learn "hag magic" spells from totems, switching between them with spacebar. </p>
<p>These include higher jumps, the ability to climb up walls, and walking on air. It’s a familiar collection of platformer abilities, perhaps, but there’s the promise of others that let you “glitch” the levels more adventurously. You can only remember two spells at once because, as a tutorial NPC politely explains, you’re old. You also forget spells when you walk through certain errors, which feels like a device the developer will use to bookend the game’s puzzles. There's a gloomier undertow: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876850/Babushkas_Glitch_Dungeon_Crystal/">the Steam page</a> mentions themes of "aging, senescence, and fear of mortality."</p>

            <p>Microsoft have developed a playable version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> that runs on generative AI. The "game" cannot currently run for longer than two minutes, has a very low frame rate, unresponsive controls, and is full of blurry textures. But Microsoft's artificial intelligensia are proud enough of the prototype that they have made it playable online. Would you like to experience a novel type of anguish? Come with me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The demo is playable on <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">Microsoft's Copilot site</a>, where they note that "Copilot may make mistakes". It operates with keyboard controls only and will prompt you with a pop-up message after two minutes to say that the timed demo is over. You can reload the page to play it again.</p>
<p>"In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II," reads a blurb on <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">a neighbouring Microsoft website</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine." </p>

<figcaption>One of these screenshots is actually Quake 2, the other is the AI demo. I'll let you guess. </figcaption>

<p>What that actually looks and feels like is a lot of staccato strafing through a surreal slosh of not-quite-right 90s shooter levels. Enemies sometimes appear and you must shoot them an unspecified number of times before they die, although will sometimes seem to reanimate. Approaching a wall and then stepping back will result in a trippy reconfiguration of your surroundings. It is like playing a bad dream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>. It is like being trapped in the sad nightmares of John Carmack after an intense binge of VR. </p>
<p>If you'd rather just watch it being played, marketing mogul Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635">tweeted a demonstration</a> of the technology, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-unveils-quake-2-inspired-ai-created-demo-but-its-practically-unplayable">point out</a>. Unsurprisingly, he didn't get a positive response from his followers, many of whom work in an industry where jobs and livelihoods are threatened by this technology.  </p>
<p>The demo is powered by Microsoft's Muse tech, which is the result of the corporate giant's research departments fiddling with AI so that it might help with "game ideation". Modelling an AI on Quake and its sequel makes sense from one perspective, since it is a quintessential shooter with concrete rules for enemy encounters and level design. The fundamental rules of the modern first-person shooter were founded by these games. </p>
<p>Yet as a fan of the long-lived Quake mapping scene, I play this demo and feel something that oscillates between curiosity and disgust, and it's probably 90 percent the latter. I like it better when the "ideation" is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-quake-singleplayer-map-pack-remixes-multiplayer-levels-from-counter-strike-mario-kart-and-more">done by people</a> capable of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">very cool work</a>, who have come together in recent years to create a legit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-renaissance-where-is-quake-and-how-did-it-get-here">Quake renaissance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
