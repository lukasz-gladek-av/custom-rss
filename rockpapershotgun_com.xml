            <p>What up, murder brothers. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> just got a new PvE mission, featuring the somewhat cranky Trygon, a big Tyranid beastie with more arms than is generally prudent. The boss will burst out of the sands of planet Avarax to stab you with said arms, but only after you hunt him down for a bit. Better take the new weapon the developers are also adding in this update: the Inferno pistol. If you want to see how shiny and well-painted these new additions look (you Warhammer freaks always do) then come gander at the trailer. </p>

<p>You're off to this dusty ruin to pick up a reluctant Tech-Priest who has refused to evacuate. But of course the spiky-limbed Trygon is going to make that difficult. "It bursts from the ground to unleash devastating assaults with its scything claws and bio-electric attacks," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500569576639038653">an update post</a> from developers Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>They've also added that new handgun, the Inferno pistol, to both PvE and PvP modes, a "close-range thermal weapon" that can be used by four of the game's marine classes: Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy. And to make multiplayer PvP a little spicier, they've also opened up other weapons to classes who previously couldn't use them. The Sniper class can now use the Heavy Bolt Pistol and Instigator Bolt Carbine, for example. </p>
<p>There's a small cloister of other stuff. You can now host private multiplayer lobbies, there are some new wolfish skins to buy, alogside new shades of blue and pink to spraypaint onto your little space fascists. You can read <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/191-7-0-patch-notes">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you go bug hunting, let me do a little lore research. Ah, yes, here we go. "The Trygon is a colossal serpentine creature whose iron-hard carapace is proof against all but the heaviest of weapons and whose giant talons can scythe through even the most formidable battle-tank," reads a description of the creature on <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/Tyranid-Trygon">Warhammer's website</a>. Good to clear things up. For me, a "Trygon" sounds like a shape you've never heard of but are asked to draw on graph paper in a high school entrance exam.  </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm not a big Warhammer dude. Although I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review Space Marine 2</a> and found it to be a pretty decent third-person insect repellant, with some well-crafted environments and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-bloody-battles-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-make-for-a-great-photo-mode">great photo mode</a>. Edwin had some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">more nuanced thoughts</a> on its depiction of goosestepping masculinity, worth a read even if, like me, you approach your blockbuster games with bubblegum-chewing aloofness, always ready to spit it out the moment all the flavour is gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
