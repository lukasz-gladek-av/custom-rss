            <p>Skatebird, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>, and Electric Zine Maker are three of the 237 games you can grab on Itch right now for $16 as part of <a href="https://itch.io/b/2965/crips-for-esims-for-gaza-bundle">Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle</a>. Why, that's a $822 saving! I mean, it's technically not a saving if you weren't going to buy anything anyway, but it's for a good cause. Here's the collective in their own words:</p>
<p>"Crips for eSims for Gaza is an international collective of disabled people who have come together in support of Palestinans, helping Gazans regain internet access via eSims (electric sim cards) connected to surrounding networks in Israel and Egypt," reads their <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/">Itch page</a>. "We recognize that everyone in Gaza is now in some way disabled due to the massive number of deaths, traumatic injuries, life-threatening illnesses and near complete destruction of medical facilities".</p>

<p>They've also made a <a href="https://cripsforesimsforgaza.itch.io/what-is-an-esim">printable mini-zine</a> explaining the importance of e-sims, which is more than I've ever done to explain an indie soulslike's parry system but maybe I should start.</p>
<p>Baba Is You is a personal favourite here. John (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baba-is-you-review">was keen too</a>. "Sublimely refined in every respect," wrote he. "It understands the player, letting you reset a screen with a single button, never penalising you for undos, and even lets you switch off its wibbly-wobbly graphic effect if it starts to drive you potty."</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2023/12/25/crips-for-esims-for-gaza/">collective's website here</a>. And remember, kids: There is no culture war, there are simply your feelings on the appropriate response to tyranny - disgust or cowardly, Stockholm-ish acquiescence. Enjoy video games!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I never played enough of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> to be seriously annoyed by its infamous level scaling system, but I gather from the anguished recollections of colleagues that it was like having a fistfight with a mirror. You'd pour all that blood and sweat into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s obtuse skill-massaging systems, and the simulation would toughen up in response, with hitherto modest bandits showing up garbed in armour and items that matched your capabilities. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's probably a life lesson in this. Something about, you know, not trying. Something about accepting that "progression" is a joke, that all our of feats are dust in Creation's compound eye, that we neither deserve nor are capable of change. Oh wait, hang on, the level scaling was a massive error of judgement! So sayeth original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith, speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/">Videogamer</a>, which invites the question: why haven't they gotten rid of it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>?
</p>
<p>
As Nesmith notes in the interview, the Remastered version's creators have made some significant adjustments to how you gain levels. Instead of improving major skills and then sleeping to boost your attributes, depending on said major skills, the new version of the RPG doles out XP per skill-up and lets you pick which attributes to improve.
</p>
<p>
"They actually went ahead and changed the game design underneath... some of the systems design," Nesmith commented. "That's pretty much unheard of in a remaster because the whole idea is that they want that old experience, so I consider that to be a very brave thing and probably help the Oblivion remaster to be significantly more popular - assuming they have done what they said and bring it to a more modern understanding of things, that's going to make the game more playable for modern sensibilities". 
</p>
<p>
So why is level scaling still in then? Today's kids are going to hate it, Bethesda, because they are, after all, kids. They still harbour the hope that they will someday amount to something, that there will be a measurable distance between what they are and how they began. 
</p>
<p>
Nesmith is as confused and horrified as you are, reader. "I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems," he told the site. "The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I'm intimately familiar with how both of those things work."
</p>
<p>
"I think the world levelling with you was a mistake and that's proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>," he went on. "That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like 'oh, it doesn't matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me"."
</p>
<p>
Are you an Oblivion survivor? I'm interested to read your doubtless seasoned thoughts about whether the level scaling system could be salvaged or improved somehow, rather than simply removed. I don't know whether it's been rejigged at all for the remaster - we've got somebody working on a longer assessment - but modders have already stepped in and stripped the fittings. Take this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">Unlevelled Item Rewards mod</a> from trainwiz, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> homage <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/underspace">Underspace</a> and also, the person largely responsible for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-the-scariest-skyrim-mod-ive-ever-seen">Skyrim's plague of Really Useful Engines</a>.

            <p>Nvidia have released the latest in an unusually frequent series of GeForce driver hotfixes, with the vast majority of identified issues affecting the newest RTX 50 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> specifically. <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">GeForce Hotfix Display Driver version 576.26</a> targets various crashing and flickering problems with, among others, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> – though it’s the growing regularity of these patch jobs that’s more disquieting than any particular instance of game breakage.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While driver hotfixes have been rare during previous GeForce generations, a recent flurry has seen them averaging about one every two weeks, from the 572.24 hotfix for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> startup crash on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> to the black screen scourge of 572.75, and now both the 576.15 and bumper-size 576.26 versions being deployed within the same day. Peering through their patch notes reveals that by far the most common thread is the RTX 50 series, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of their software stability.</p>
<p>I should say that I haven’t experienced any such problems myself while reviewing these cards, which performance-wise, range from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">pretty decent</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">enormously disappointing</a>. Still, I am but one hardware editor, and even the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/564309/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57626-released-42/">Nvidia forum post</a> announcing the latest hotfix leads into a raft of community replies reporting various continuing problems. Driver version 576.02, the most recent stable driver, is repeatedly identified as a breaking point, and with two hotfixes having now been sticky-plastered on top of it, the accusation carries some weight.</p>
<p>It's true that 'stable' drivers are faced with potentially meddlesome time restraints, as they’re usually released in support of either key new games or a new piece of hardware (the RTX 5060 Ti, in 576.02’s case). Still, that’s been the case with GeForce drivers for donkeys’ ages, so can’t really shoulder the blame for the sudden uptick in problems and resultant hotfixes. In any case, if you’ve been having hiccups with your own GeForce GPU, <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">give version 576.26 a download</a> and hope you won’t need another one for a while. It’ll need to be a manual installation, as hotfixes aren’t released through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a> like stable drivers are.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
