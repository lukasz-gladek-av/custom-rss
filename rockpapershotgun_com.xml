            <p>The first thing that happened to me <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218790/The_Little_Tomb_The_Maholova_Club_and_the_Search_for_a_Dead_Body/">in the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-little-tomb-the-maholova-club-and-the-search-for-a-dead-body">The Little Tomb: The Maholova Club And The Search For A Dead Body</a> was a stuffed horse on a spring telling me it knew when and how I'd die. Many such horses. You play as Kofun, a boy shaped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun">keyhole tomb</a> who is also sort of an actual keyhole tomb but also a boy who wants to fulfill his destiny <em>as</em> a keyhole tomb, namely by finding a dead body to bury inside of himself. He lives in a park with his mate Haniwa, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haniwa">Haniwa</a>. Haniwa's secret is that he's very good at calligraphy. Here's some visual orientation in case you're not caught up yet.</p>

<p>It's from Cavyhouse, whose previous offering was “dungeon agriculturalization roguelite game” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396980/The_Sealed_Ampoule">The Sealed Ampoule</a>. The demo itself is a little too short to get a good feel for things, but if it's at all representative, the game is primarily about hanging out with good weirdos and poking objects.</p>
<p>You hang about in the park Kofun and Hanawa live in. You slide down a slide. Swing on a swing. Swing on a bar, an annoying object for its refusal to bend to the verb-noun symmetry found elsewhere. You collect points for doing all this, then spend them on pondering various objects. I very much enjoy the idea of a <em>pondering currency</em>, both conceptually and in practise. It's all suitably whimsical but then Kofun will occasionally gesture at the fact that he is, undoubtedly, a tomb. I am nothing if not curious to see where this all goes. <a href="https://www.artribune.com/progettazione/2025/07/anticipazioni-videogiochi/">Cheers to The Attribune</a> for the spot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finally-a-game-about-a-boy-who-thinks-hes-a-tomb-searching-for-a-dead-body-to-bury-inside-of-him]]></content:encoded>
