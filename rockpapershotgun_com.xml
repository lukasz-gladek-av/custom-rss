            <p>Yaaar, me hearties. Pull up a barstool and take another swig of grog. I be hearin' fresh tales of a treasure that's reportedly still in development at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>These whispers be comin' from Matt Ryan, the voice actor behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a>'s swashbucking stabber Edward Kenway. He's cheekily told some landlubbers that they may have to beat the game again, prompting the parrots to start squawking about a return to the Carribean yet again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a video posted to that most piratey of platforms, TikTok, Ryan asked a fan he was busy signing stuff for at a convention whether they'd played Black Flag. "Well, you might have to beat it again," the actor replied after the fan said yaaarrr.</p>
<p>After the fan said they've got to replay all of the games, Ryan then added: "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." It's not quite a map to an island where there's a big X, but it's certainly got folks talking about the best AC game and sea shanty singalong machine again.</p> <div>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't confirmed that a Black Flag remake is in the works, Kotaku reported that this was the case <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">back in 2023</a>, stating that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> developers Ubisoft Singapore were involved. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-says-fans-may-have-to-beat-the-game-again-as-remake-rumours-mount/">VGC</a> wrote in their story on Ryan's loose lippery that the remake is still in development as of right now.
</p>
<p>Black Flag, in case you've not played it, is a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">outstanding pirate game</a>. Sailing around in a big ship blasting various navies to bits with cannons and then boarding so you can take their booty was a right hoot in 2013, and odds are it'll be just as much of a hoot in the 2020s, assuming we do get this remake at some point.</p>
<p>For now, maybe start dusting off your tricorn and twin flintlock pistols, but keep your powder dry just in case things somehow hit the rocks and we don't set sail to the mysterious Isla de Remake a some point down the line.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balls have never been footed so fast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the moreish multiplayer soccer game from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, has seen its first cases of speedhackers infesting the game over the last week. </p>
<p>It's not unusual for multiplayer games to suffer a few cheaters, and it's not clear how widespread the hacking tools are being used among the growing number of players (now at 3 million players, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">according to Sloclap</a>). But it is a mild concern to anyone who prefers their team mates and opponents to move at regular human pace, and not say, the speed of an angry motorcycle, as shown in footage captured by several players. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkVDYOclm4">video of a speedhacker</a> posted by a player shows a nippy ne'er-do-well whirling around the pitch with the ball jerkily following their fast feet, scoring a few goals in the process as other players jog around sadly or stand still - perhaps completely stunned, or maybe just in the process of quitting the game. A couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aW5XIFsogo">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV-SYWamSro">videos</a> show the same behaviour in more matches. Booo! Poor sportsmanship, that.</p>
<p>Rematch does feature Easy Anti-cheat, however it looks like these sneaks have found a workaround, allowing them to run like a pursued gazelle across the field, even in a ranked 5v5 game. No anti-cheat solution is watertight but you'd hope this wouldn't happen when your precious Bronze division ranking is on the line. Hopefully it's something that can be caught and fixed by the studio. We've asked Sloclap for comment. </p>
<p>I haven't encountered a cheater myself so far, and it's worth saying that I'm loving the game. I effused as much in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">Rematch review</a>. Even with its occasional server hiccup and the crashes that happen more frequently than I'd like, it's the most enjoyable football 'em up I've played since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>. I am wary of the corporate sponsors lurking in the battlepass (last week saw the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lsjmapqe6b2s">addition of a cosmetic kit</a> sponsored by sportswear company Puma). Football is like religion - better at the grassroots than under a wealthy organisation. But if it helps Sloclap keep the servers live, and doesn't get too invasive, I can shrug these things off.</p>
<p>Opponents running at superhuman speeds, though. That I cannot beat by wearing a brand.</p></div>
