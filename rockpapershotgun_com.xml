            <p>I bring ill tidings from the land of folks who're usually busy stressing about their heirs, sire. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s paid Coronations DLC has arrived alongside the Ascendant update, and I regret to inform you that the little expansion's immediately been put in the stocks. The rotten tomatoes doth fly towards its bonce, and the resulting juice has turned its Steam reviews a mostly negative shade of crimson.</p><!--more-->
<p>Coronations was always set to be a relatively minor stop in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3486700/Crusader_Kings_III_Chapter_IV/">Chapter 4</a> pipeline of DLC Paradox have been gradually rolling out to their regal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> thing since March this year, especially compared to larger expansions like the beefier Khans of the Steppe and All Under Heaven add-ons, which bookend it on the release timeline. Basically, it makes ascending to the throne more of a big deal than it has been in the past, with a proper party and an oath you take to set a goal to accomplish during your rule. You can leaf through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/509590727168100419?l=english">full notes here</a>.</p>

<p>Given that Paradox were set to charge for those pretty minimal, if important, additions, at least one Reddit seer was predicting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1n7tgmk/so_we_all_know_this_is_going_to_get_eviscerated/">a week ago</a> that Coronations might well end up struggling to impress the virtual regents of Steam. It's currently sitting at a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/#app_reviews_hash">mostly negative verdict</a> from 188 reviews on there, with complaints also having leaked into the top posts of the Redditosphere, so that random citizen's crystal ball wasn't playing up. To be fair, predicting a Paradox DLC might be controversial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">doesn't exactly make you Nostradamus at this point</a>.</p><p>A lot of the objections in these reviews are simply folks arguing that Paradox should have made this update a free one, either because they view it as not offering enough depth to justify the £4.29/$4.99/€4.99 price tag, or because coronation mechanics like these are significant enough they should be rolled into the base game. Much like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-making-adjustments-to-bloodlines-2s-day-one-vampire-clan-dlc-plans-following-backlash">paid DLC clans</a>, the publishers are being accused of nickel and diming players with their add-ons. On one hand, Paradox have clearly stated what you'll be getting if you opt to buy the Coronations pack, so you can't really accuse them of being deceptive. The argument's whether this is greedy monetisation, and I'd say it certainly lands on the grubby or unneccesary end of the scale.</p>
<p>The less subjective aspect of the negative reception comes in the form of widespread complaints about those new oaths breaking in scenarios when they shouldn't. I've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nctnfb/my_coronation_oath_to_ensure_peace_failed_even/">not managed to ensure peace</a> even though I'm not at war. I completed my oath years ago, but have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">subsequently been told I've broken it</a>, and been served the substantial penalties to match. A number of players also reckon the timeframes given are too short, with 20 years to complete three legendary hunts being the main culprit.</p>
<p>That said, some of the examples I've read through feel like they can probably be attributed to the normal bad luck or quirkiness you might get when Crusader Kinging. Oh no, I've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1ncy1hw/another_wonderful_oversight_from_the_new_dlc_oaths/">broken my oath of preparing a good heir</a> because my son died and my grandson's a bit crap. That's a bit more c'est la medieval monarch vie to me.</p>
<p>This being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, there's already a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3565532638">mod to disable the broken oath event</a> if you wish. Coronations has also left a plenty of folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd0geg/all_under_heaven_and_ck3s_future/">concerned about the game's future</a>. Specifically Paradox's ability to deliver something good with the much-anticipated All Under Heaven DLC, which is set to expand the map into Asia, letting you lord over the likes of China and Japan. We'll have to see if the publisher can wrest back the non-reviled DLC crown.</p>

            <p>Two days before launch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has its PC <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pc-specs-and-features/">system requirements</a>. They’re generally on the higher side without teetering over into full-on tech demo lunacy – the RTX 2070 is a minimum-spec <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a>, for instance – though anyone with a smaller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> will need to make room for the looty FPS sequel’s bumper-size 100GB storage requirement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, gargantuan install sizes are kind of obnoxious (even the infamously bloated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">Call of Duty agrees</a>), and are partly caused by merely visual, high-resolution textures that we increasingly need madly expensive GPUs to even enable. Or at least, to enable without simultaneously committing framerateicide.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 100 is a very round and satisfying number. Just look at it. Way better than 112 or some garbage. I do wonder if anyone working in Gearbox’s gigabyte dieting department saw it was possible to compress it down to 99GB, potentially avoiding the shock of entering the triple digits, but left it at 100GB just because it’s vaguely <em>nicer</em>. I suspect I’d do the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s the hardware:</p>
<h3>Borderlands 4 minimum PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 / 11</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 core minimum)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580 (8GB minimum)</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100GB (SSD required)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Borderlands 4 recommended PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 / Windows 11</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100GB (SSD required)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solid state hungriness aside, it’s a bit strange seeing the Arc B580 in the recommended tier, alongside the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT – it’s a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-b580-review">good little budget card</a> but not on the same level as those two older, yet bonafide high-end GPUs. Though maybe that means Borderlands 4 performs better-than-recommended on this Nvidia/AMD kit?</p><p>Also, 2K’s post doesn’t mention it specifically, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> is supported as well. This needs a GeForce RTX 50 series card to operate at full pelt, with RTX 40 models making do with DLSS 3-style 2x frame gen.</p>
<p>I’m generally in the 'wait and see how it is' camp on Fourderlands, with its new planet and its many billions of randomly generated firearms, having previously been interested enough to mulch through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> with mates but jointly concluding it wasn’t worth our time. This new one is something of a reset, with its lead writer Taylor Clark claiming it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won’t have as many jokes</a>. Which is, at once, likely an improvement and also a weird thing to make a selling point of. B4's out on September 12th.</p>
