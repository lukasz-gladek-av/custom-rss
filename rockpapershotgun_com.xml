            <p>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror">r/twosentencehorror</a> will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-struggles-backlash-positive-reviews/">told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"If you take Paranormal Activity, it cost pennies and it made millions," Kciuk continued. TheGamer follow up in their article with The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blair-witch">Blair Witch</a> Project, Get Out, and Terrifier 3 as examples of low budget horror films that made a lot more than they cost. Get Out, for example, was the highest grossing debut based on an original screenplay in history as of 2017, raking in over $250 million worldwide on a budget $4.5 million.</p>
<p>"This is one of the genres in both film and games where you actually can take very little resources, and the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage," Kciuk went on, citing the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>. "It's a very small game, and it was done in like a month or two, and it earned millions of dollars. Horror tends to have those breakout hits from very small teams, or even solo developers."</p>
<p>I imagine that Kciuk doesn’t actually find spreadsheeting to be “the interesting part” about making horror. More, as she alludes to, the freedom to make some very effective work with limited resources. The proliferation of PSX-style horror speaks to her assertion that "the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage". I’m reminded, fittingly, of how the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> turned short draw distances into an aesthetic with that game’s iconic fog. There’s some great examples of horror cinema turning restrictions into innovation, too, like Sam Raimi’s shaky cam and travelling shots in The Evil Dead 2.</p><p>Still, this is also might be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on how few truly big-budget horror games actually gets made. Outside of Capcom’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> series, and the occasional outlier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-sales-figures-2-1-million">like Alien Isolation</a>, the fact that horror appears cost-effective might just be the result of small budget horror making up most of what’s available. There are also big games that suggest the opposite, like the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> - one of my personal favourites from recent years that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">still struggling to recoup development costs</a>.</p>

            <p>I just played the neon bathroom graffiti on magic mushrooms stylings of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games"> puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a> for the first time last night, and it is very much my thing. It’s glowy! It’s violent! It’s thinky! You can <em>be</em> a <em>bullet, </em>and <em>then</em> you can be <em>another bullet</em>! Mental! (It’s technically the same bullet, but still!)</p>
<p>The basic idea is you take out stages of dudes, but you lose if you ever shoot without killing something. You move to where your bullet lands, so you have to plan routes through all the enemies, making sure one target is in view of the next. Also, you can steer the bullets if you want. Sometimes you can snipe a bird and feel the soaring freedom of a top down-view. Sometimes you snipe a fish and feel like a bastard. It’s great.</p>
<p>It’s also currently 40% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">on Steam</a>, alongside a new horde mode update. Trailer below, and details below-erer.</p>

<p>“Take on entire platoons of THE CULT’s brainwashed minions, but watch out for a new enemy that can fire back,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1309950/view/4481739601737681384">the update</a>. “The sniper cultist has a bullet with your name on it, and will put a premature end to your quest for vengeance if you don’t find a way to deal with them”. I am literally just learning about this now. I’m only about eight levels in. Enemies that can fire back sound silly, in a good way.</p><p>“If you’re wondering how THE GIRL can take on an entire horde of cultists with only one bullet, well, now she can reload: by shooting herself,” it continues. Ahhhh. Now that does sound interesting - factoring your own position into the puzzle routes.</p>
<p>But don’t listen to me! Listen to Alice Bell (RPS in peace). I’m speaking to you from the regular-ass present, while Alice has the power to speak to you <em>from the past</em>, when everything was better. “Despite some frustrations, Children Of The Sun is an intense shooter-puzzler with bags of style and originality,”<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/children-of-the-sun-review"> she wrote</a>. “It's an intense, bite-sized category-snubber with bags of style. Such originality is to be encouraged.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
