            <p>Some people don't like cockroaches. I've always found them to be reliable mounts for the tiny gnome army via which I'll one day conquer the world. Anyway, forget I wrote that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates">come out this week</a>, and as such folks have fired up their modding machines and got to work tweaking the garden survival extravaganza to their liking.</p>
<p>Let's see here, we've got some of the usual useful changes, texture swaps, and...ah. A mod designed to help folks who're afraid of cockroaches. It'll do just that, provided you're not also terrified of clowns, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-red-soldier-ant-egg-location">bugs</a> vaguely dressed like them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm starting off with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/20">this roach mod</a>, put together by gallant Arthurian knight/modder Sir_galahad172. They've had a good idea. Save the folks with phobias by arranging the cockroach equivalent of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-arachnophobia-mode-spider-differences">arachnophobia mode</a> the game has to change eight-legged enemies into something less spidery.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though. At first, I just saw the party hats and painted eyes they've given the roaches and thought oh, ok, they must be going for a Saturday night under the floorboards sort of vibe. Then I clocked the goofy shoes on each spindly limb and the red nose. Putting two and two together, this has to be a roach clown. Is it clowny enough to go off the deep end in the other direction and give nightmares to folks who can't sit through IT? I'm not sure, but you get a mixed review of your valiant attempt at making people un-scared, Sir Galahad.</p>
<p>To cut them some slack, I can throughly appreciate the fact they've swapped the SCAB scanner for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/15">Pip-Boy</a>, in some Xbox brand synergy so synergistic Phil Spencer's probably just had to reach for the tissues. Ditto their spooky, scary skeletonising of the player character.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, they're not the only one at it. There are bunch of tweaks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/8">stack size</a> (all the way up to 999 if you want), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/9">difficulty</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/13">player stats</a> from modder Caites. You can also chuck in a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/14">hasty port of an item spawner</a> for the first game and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/10">Mod Organiser 2 support</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, aside from the roach clown, it's close to what you'd expect for most big-ish games that've recently debuted on PC. We'll have to see if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 has the insect legs to outdo the fairly titchy total of 144 mods planted in its predecessor's backyard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-modding-kicks-off-with-cockroaches-dressed-as-clowns-which-is-good-for-bugphobes-so-long-as-they-arent-also-circusphobes]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The next big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s now out there via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">Steam testing client</a>, as devs Funcom look to test out its various tweaks before pressing go on full deployment next month. If you've been desperately screaming for the ability to slop out a bunch of blood and/or water at once, or have recently be chased by a swarm of griefy ornithopters, this is the patch for you.</p>
<p>In fact, the devs make clear that they'd really prefer it if you were to dedicate the bulk of your two-week-long patch testing time to those two things in particular. They're also turning off taxes and sandstorms, the latter very much being the tax equivalent of the natural world, for the first week so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear">bases won't be at risk</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The rundown of the notes for patch 1.1.20, naturally, starts off with these two changes. "Colliding ornithopters will now get an impulse applied to separate them," the devs wrote, "This will mitigate the griefing done to Carrier ornithopters by swarming with multiple ornithopters." So, no more getting crashed into by a gaggle of cheeky spice field seagulls, or pinned down by one until you get wormed, at the cost of not being able to have a friendly head-on wreck when you fancy it.</p>
<p>Funcom are even offering a free top-tier buggy, scout ornithopter, assault ornithopter, and carrier ornithopter to folks who've already been into the game's test client and created a character, so people have no excuse not to see how this tweak works. Instructions to claim them are in the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/public-test-client-version-1-1-20-0/">full notes here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the devs have finally added the option to deposit all of the blood and water you're carrying into purifiers and cisterns with one button press, something players have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">begging for since launch</a>. You can also take all of the water back out again with one button press, though not the blood, which earns a boo from me.</p>
<p>Among the other tweaks are things like the flour sand and spice sand fields in Hagga Basin being put in the path of sandworm danger, which is bad news for folks who've been taking advantage of the chance to gather those without having to worry about being Shai-Huluded. The worms have also been made slightly deadlier, as running into its body during any of its animations will now result in death or your vehicle going pop.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, the prices of melange spiced beer, spiced wine, spiced liquour, and also napalm are all among those lowered by the patch in an effort to make them more attractive to buy, so there's your next long weekend in the back garden of your base sorted.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, Funcom have ducked their heads around the door to <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/upcoming-change-to-pentashield-only-bases/">announce another change</a> they'll be making with this patch. They're making it illegal to build pentashields without proper support, so if you've erected one in that manner, here's your warning that it'll collapse once patch 1.1.20 goes live in full.</p>
<p>The devs are currently aiming to have that happen on August 12, so make sure you pin a note to your fridge.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-are-testing-a-patch-thatll-let-you-deposit-all-of-your-blood-and-should-help-tackle-ornithopter-griefing]]></content:encoded>
