            <p>
We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-developers-warn-fans-to-watch-out-for-a-fraudulent-playtest">fish puns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-is-powerwash-simulator-for-holes">naughty jokes about holes</a> to warn you that a huge chunk of celestial debris <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2025/02/07/nasa-continues-to-monitor-orbit-of-near-earth-asteroid-2024-yr4/">has a 2.3% chance of impacting Earth in December 2032</a> and wiping out the city of Bradford. I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_YR4">Asteroid 2024 YR4</a> loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.
</p>
<p>
If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool <a href="https://neal.fun/asteroid-launcher/">Asteroid Launcher</a>, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
YR24 is said to be 130-300 feet across, and is made of stone. Let’s split the difference and say it’s 215 feet across, or a few short of 70 metres. According to Asteroid Launcher, if a 70 metre wide stone asteroid were to explode in the atmosphere 2.4 kilometres above my flat, while travelling at 17 kilometres a second, the devastation would be catastrophic. The resulting 211 decibel shockwave would totally obliterate my favourite chippie down the road. My local Cafe Neros at the bottom of the hill would experience winds faster than the storms on Jupiter. My favourite curry shop in London would likely be levelled, which I guess is fine because I think they’re planning to move anyway. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds unbearable, but it could be worse. My favourite London takeaway joint would fall slightly outside the blast radius, and people eating in my favourite vegan pizza place might not even glance up from their Pepper-no-nis. Curiously, if the asteroid were 30 metres bigger, big enough to make landfall, the area-of-effect would apparently be smaller and the casualties, fewer, give or take a few extra from earthquakes. I can’t remotely speak to the accuracy of whatever science Asteroid Launcher runs on. I’m fairly sure it’s not a standard reporting tool at any major space agency. If it is, we have more immediate problems to worry about than YR24.
</p>
<p>
What drives somebody to read about an extremely unlikely asteroid impact and immediately load up a free browser game in order to simulate their own destruction? I don’t know, but it’s an instinct that informs a lot of video games. Patient zero could be the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. We’ve all had that moment in SimCity, right, when the infrastructure is humming and all your residential, industrial and commercial zones are in perfect equilibrium, and a rasping voice in your ear says “Screw it – die, you pack of filthy little law-abiding conformists”, and you push the Godzilla button.</p>
<p>It’s the same nihilism that flowers within my spleen when I read the label on a bottle of shower gel made by a company that whimsically declares its boss to be “Nature”. Video games are great at venting such feelings, which is perhaps less constructive when it means, say, dissipating pent-up anguish about climate change, but surely forgiveable enough when it comes to the fickle motions of marauding space rocks.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you need a pick-me-up after reading all that, I recommend sumptuous planet-nurser <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a>. Oh look, it was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/499436070246548643?l=english">recently updated</a>! With a selection of… natural disasters.

            <p>The flash flood of marketing that poured forth from PlayStation's State Of Play last night splashes wetly upon we PC players too. Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will <em>not</em> release. And that's mildly interesting.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is coming out September 23rd, as celebrated by the maniacally cackling mascot at the end of the trailer. The lootsy shootsy was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-looks-ready-to-drop-the-hottest-memes-of-2011-in-first-look-trailer">announced shortly before Christmas</a> last year, and will have the usual 4-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, random weapons, and sense of "humour". This time your team of lootbox addicts will be battling "the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high."</p>
<p>So, Borderlands again. Still, there's a fun bit of obvious deduction to glean here. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick reassured shareholders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">an earnings call</a> last week that the company was confident they were giving enough space to their big releases. That's to be expected, publishers like to space out their games for maximum sales. All of which suggests GTA 6 probably won't hit the shelves in September. Or at least the weeks around Borderlands 4 will be a big buffer zone. Zelnick himself has twice confirmed the open world crim sim is on-target for an autumn 2025 release. </p>
<p>It's fun to speculate that the other big games of the season are playing "release date chicken" because of Grand Theft Auto 6, which still hasn't announced when it will arrive to nuke all the other games released that week from orbit. But studios can always reschedule once they see it coming, and some game buyers don't care about GTA at all. Still, it feels like Take-Two has eliminated at least a couple of possible weeks from the guessing game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a> studio Housemarque sound like they're aiming to put more emphasis on the <em>lite </em>part of the roguelite formula with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, their next loop 'em up space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> arriving exclusive to PlayStation 5 next year and likely on PC sometime after that, if past time loops are anything to go on.</p>
<p>You'll be exploring a lost space colony as Arjun Devraj, a "Soltari Enforcer" played by Midnight Mass actor and big nerd Rahul Kohli. The planet you're on is named 'Carcosa', perhaps suggesting a continuation of the cosmic horror bits that Returnal did so well.</p>

<p>It does sound <em>very</em> similar to Returnal otherwise, which is no bad thing. If you missed that one, it was a third person shooter with roguelite and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> elements that stood out from the pack through incredibly nifty gunfeel and enemy design, and a pretty singular atmosphere of sci-fi tinged dread. It was, dare I say, cosmic horror done right.</p>
<p>That said, it could also be very punishing until you got your bearings, which I imagine put some folks off early. Saros is aiming to do things <em>a little differently</em>. I can't write "a little differently" without my internal monologue making it sound like it's written in cool guy voice with The Fonz fingers. It is actually a little different though. From the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/">PlayStation blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is permanent resources and progression making every death valuable. After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to “come back stronger” to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roguelite meta progression?! Surely no valued RPS commenters will have strong and often insightful opinions on <em>that</em> universally good design feature!</p>
<p>It took the original Returnal a couple of years to come to PC. Sony have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-have-bought-housemarque-developers-of-returnal-and-nex-machina">scooped up Housemarque since then</a>, so whether this complicates matters I'm not sure. Sony have talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-may-invest-more-in-its-efforts-to-bring-playstation-games-to-pc">focusing more on PC in the past</a>, and we've seen previously exclusive titles hit Steam with increasing frequency lately. They also finally dropped that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">pesky PSN account requirement last month</a>. Oh, and do play Housemarque's other game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nex-machina">Nex Machina</a> if you haven't, it's excellent.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>
<em>RPS founder Alec Meer wrote for Returnal and is the lead writer on Saros. </em>
