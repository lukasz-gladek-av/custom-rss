            <p>Someone ring up Slayer, because it's going to raining blood in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> soon. That being the natural way to precede the arrival of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s first paid DLC bounty pack next month and a free December update that'll bring a weird tree fight to the endgame.</p>
<p>All of this stuff will lay a pre-Christmas foundation for the arrival of a fresh vault hunter early next year. That hunter, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-has-found-his-soulmate-an-edgy-cowboy-robot-named-after-money-thats-in-borderlands-4s-first-dlc">Gearbox showed off a little while ago</a> out of contept for chronological reveals, is Randy Pitchford's magic cowboy spirit animal.</p>

<p>This latest pulling of Borderlands 4 future additions from Randall Pitchenford's hat took place at PAX Australia. The man himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w6mSoYgaiPI?t=165s">walked onto stage</a>, mentioned his magicness, and referenced Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan in the presence of a 13 year old.</p><p>In light of that, I'll point out that you find out all of the info you need about what he was revealing via a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">handy post</a> that's less Pitchfordy. First of all, Borderlands 4's first paid DLC bounty pack dubbed How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will arrive on November 20th. It'll be an extra missions, legendary gear and boss fight affair based around Outbounders leader Rush battling with a dude called Screw over the way in which some kind of sellsword holiday celebration is, er, celebrated. This DLC's also bundled in with the deluxe editions of the game, so you'll get it at no extra cost if you've already spent extra money.</p>
<p>Preceding that will be a free Halloween-themed event called Horrors of Kairos, which is set to run from October 23rd to November 6th. It'll bring new legendary loot and also add blood rain to world boss battles. Make sure you don't mistake the crimson precipitation for jam, I suppose. Also, whose blood is it? Do we assume that it belonged to folks the boss has previously slain, in which case you might end up having your own blood drop on your bonce? Is there some kind of special Halloween blood supply that the gnomes who run Borderlands 4's clouds will only uncork every Halloween, like some aged vintage?</p>
<p>I digress, on to the final set of additions for this year. A free December update's set to deliver some extra bits to keep those who've already battled through almost all of the game happy. Bloomreaper the Invincible is a mutant tree thing, and also the first in a series of invincible endgame bosses who aren't actually invincible. As with its namesake Crawmerax the Invincible, however, Bloomreaper will be very tough. In line with that, the update'll also deliver a new difficulty level for Ultimate Vault Hunter mode.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Gearbox'll also be keeping up the patches, with next week's looking very much like it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-director-warns-next-patch-will-target-overpowered-builds-relying-on-unintended-interactions">murder some overpowered builds</a>.</p>
