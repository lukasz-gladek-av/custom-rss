            <p>In case you missed it, a plucky little game no one had heard anything about whatsoever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">arrived yesterday</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yeah, I know, it's news to me too. Anyway, what's also news is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone has a voice acting cameo in Skong. Though, he's being all coy about revealing when and where you can hear his dulcet tones.</p>
<p>This came to light because of some valiant folks who've already made it to Silksong's end credits, presumably having pulled mammoth sessions last night, as our own Ollie did to provide you lot with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">some helpful early game walkthroughs</a>. Or, you know, they've gone to the extras bit of the main menu and pressed the button that rolls the credits.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Barone's name is just chilling there in a section dedicated to additional characters voices, which also features Team Cherry marketing and publishing fellow Matthew Griffin. Naturally, the question is where do folks have to go to find Barone's cameo?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape">The Verge</a>, who reached out to ConcernedApe LLC's head of operations Cole Medeiros, neither he nor Barone would just come out and say where the cameo is, despite confirming it is indeed <em>that</em> Eric Barone. Medeiros told the site that the Stardew and and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev would "rather not say which character(s) so as not to spoil any surprises for anyone".</p>
<p>I've not had a chance to join the RPS Skong hive currently reviewing/guiding/Edwining their way through Silksong yet, so I'm gonna take a big old stab in the dark as to which character Barone's voiced.</p>
<p>It's this one:</p>

Fear not, fans of spirit candy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cats-out-of-the-bag-stardew-valley-update-17-revealed-bagged-cat-content-tbc">The recent announcement of Stardew Valley 1.7 update</a> is not evidence that Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> has been banished to the realm of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> - or so sayeth Barone himself, at least. In a brief and caveat-strewn Q&amp;A, the life sim creator has gone into more depth about development on Stardew, revealing that he's not as heavily involved with it as with previous updates. As such, he's still focussing "the vast majority" of his attention on Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p>It's even possible that the latter will release before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s next update, but let's not count our Cocoa Loco Little Choc Chicks (£6.99 minus delivery costs) before they've hatched.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"Recently, I announced that there will be another major content update for Stardew Valley -- the 1.7 update," <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/">writes Barone on his blog</a>. "You might be wondering: If ConcernedApe is working on Stardew Valley 1.7, will that cause Haunted Chocolatier to take longer? The answer: Maybe a little, but not as much as you might think."
</p>
<p>

Barone goes onto explain that he's been working with a small team on Stardew Valley additions and fixes since update 1.3 - he's still "completely solo" on Haunted Chocolatier "for the time being". 
</p>
<p>
While he was "fully, personally locked-in on content development" for previous Stardew updates, Barone says that with update 1.7, "I have been trying to take more of a "creative director" role in the team, so that (at least for now) I can focus the vast majority of my attention on Haunted Chocolatier." 
</p><p>
"So far, it's been pretty good... we are working at a relaxed pace, we have a ton of ideas, and everything has been high quality," Barone continues. "Eventually, I will have to spend a little more time focused on Stardew Valley, because in order for me to maintain a full connection to the game, I need my hand to touch every piece of new content. And there are some aspects of content development which I insist on doing myself, like the music. 
</p>
<p>
"But with our "no release date" approach to the 1.7 update, it's not certain when that time will come. It might even be after Haunted Chocolatier comes out. (no guarantees though)".
</p>
<p>
Barone adds that "the reality of my life is that I have a very popular 1st game that I still want to take care of, which means that my 2nd game might take a little longer". Stardew Valley's audience is "still growing", he notes, and "it's hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved. But I hope the approach I am taking for Stardew Valley 1.7 will help keep Haunted Chocolatier on track."
</p>
<p>
Stardewman remains tight-lipped as to what update 1.7 might involve. We don't know a whole caboodle about Haunted Chocolatier, either, other than that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">more of an action-RPG than Stardew Valley</a>, and sees you staffing a chocolate shop with ghosts.</p><p>Let me laboriously do some Audience Engagement and ask: what kind of chocolate would you be <em>least</em> surprised to discover is made by ghosts? I've always found hazelnut truffles a bit sinister. I find that they mysteriously make me fatter - clear indications of paranormal activity.
