            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> voice actor Ned Luke - aka Michael de Santa - got swatted for the eighth time over Xmas. I don’t mean that somebody belted him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. I mean that somebody put in a hoax call to emergency services in a bid to have armed police sent to his house. The latest incident happened this December while Luke was streaming GTA Online with Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. YouTuber IceBladeNinja has the whole clip for you to watch below.</p><!--more-->

<p>“Swatting” is, obviously, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/first-ever-uk-swatting-sentence-passed-after-man-shot-in-face-by-armed-unit-due-to-hoax-call-13118559">very dangerous</a> in a country like the USA, where there are more guns than humans and the police are especially well-armed. It has gotten <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/ohio-gamer-pleads-guilty-swatting-caused-death">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-man-targeted-his-twitter-handle-dies-after-swatting-call-n1274747">of people</a> killed, that I know about.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the cops seem pretty relaxed in the footage, possibly because they’re aware that Luke is a frequent target of such malevolent pranking - indeed, one of them can be heard saying "you've been swatted again". If it were me, I’d be lying on the floor nonetheless with all limbs extended at 45 degree angles, but Luke just gets up with a sigh and says hello to the fuzz, then goes back to playing GTA Online for an hour and a half. I guess it’s just as well he didn’t answer the door in character for Michael.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Kotaku</a>, Luke says he was repeatedly swatted in late 2023, after his address was leaked online, and that at one point, the police ordered him to step outside his house. He's also initiated legal proceedings against some of the swatters, with one person due <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2004926105275498972">to appear in court for sentencing</a> this month - we'll keep an eye out for that, I guess. It’s not clear there’s any real motivation for Luke's repeated swatting, beyond random people being spiteful.</p>
<p>This feels like the kind of morbid present-day cultural phenomena the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> should parody, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6s-wholesome-boris-bike-docking-revealed-in-alleged-wip-rockstar-portfolio-video">Boris Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Florida Man</a>, but then again, that would only be encouraging the arseholes.

            <p>Cubey sandbox crafter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> launches into early access next Tuesday, January 13th, after a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">dicey few months</a> in which it was cancelled, bought out by the original developers, and revived like a majestic square-beaked phoenix. It’ll also have a native Linux version, allowing anyone fed up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-most-important-pc-gaming-news-stories-in-2026">Microsoft’s continued bullshit</a> to play it on a system running something that <em>isn’t</em> an increasingly bloated or prematurely abandoned Windows.</p>
<p>There are caveats, mind. In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2006774600491827296">Xitter post</a> announcing the Linux version, Hypixel co-founder and tech director Kevin Carstens – well spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/native-linux-support-for-hytale-will-be-launched-as-experimental/">Gaming on Linux</a> – stresses that it’ll be an "experimental" endeavour, potentially susceptible to bugs specific to different distributions (sub-versions) of the open-source OS. And the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which runs the Linux-based SteamOS, is in a trickier position still. Carstens explains that limited testing on a docked Deck, with the handheld aided by a mouse and keyboard, suggests it can run local singleplayer fine, though it’s "not officially recommended" as a Hytale-playing device as the game currently lacks controller support.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's easy to see this as the latest move in a campaign of expectation management on Hypixel’s part, the newly minted developer-owners having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">previously warned</a> that Hytale is "still very much unfinished and broken", as well as electing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">not to release on Steam</a> until it’s been hammered into better shape. Broadly, though, this is still good news for Linux PC owners. It remains a rarity for games to get full-blooded native ports, and even a buggy Linux version can sidestep the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">pitfalls</a> of running a Windows game on a compatibility layer, as the Steam Deck does for most of its playable catalogue.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t count the Deck out entirely, though. It’s apparently already cleared the performance hurdle – Hytale is "well playable" on it, according to Carstens – and considering that the Java version of fellow block-manipulator Minecraft can be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">tweaked and tuned</a> to run on Valve’s portable PC, despite its own lack of controller/gamepad support, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that Hytale could find a similarly custom-built solution. At the very least, Linux compatibility bodes well for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, which also runs SteamOS and adopts a PC-like box design that lends itself better to mouse and keyboard piloting. It even <em>looks</em> a little like a Hytale block.</p>

<p>Steam hardware surveys indicate <a href="https://www.club386.com/steam-hardware-survey-shows-how-linux-is-slowly-eating-into-windows-market-share/">Linux usage grew slightly in 2025</a>, amid widespread (and vocal) consumer dissatisfaction with Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">shuttering of Windows 10</a>, stuffing of Windows 11 with unwanted and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-detail-agentic-ai-plan-for-windows-11-immediately-admit-it-might-install-malware-on-your-pc">potentially dangerous AI 'features'</a>, and questionable military contracts. While I’m not aboard the boycott train just yet, the possibility of freeing myself from the Redmond monopoly is becoming more and more attractive, especially when more and more developers are taking Linux seriously as an alternative. And when it’s just not nearly as rubbish for games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-problems-we-had-with-gaming-on-linux">as it used to be</a>.</p>
<p>But what say you, reader? Should we be paying more attention to Linux, potentially outside the relatively 'big' SteamOS developments? Here’s a poll – let us know. Feed us with data, that we may all be nourished.</p>

            <p>Gerry from the River rides up to a noticeboard. Between contracts, he scans the pinned scraps for a fresh job to take on, only for his eyes to rest on one particularly peculiar bit of prose. 'There's a mysterious extra DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> in the works', this bit of paper claims. 'Oh, you mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">that anniversary patch</a> which was delayed last year?' Gerry's mutant brain asks in response. 'No, seemingly not that one,' the sentient scrap replies.</p>
<p>Gerry grumbles to himself in mild confusion. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s a decade old at this point, and while CD's love of relentlessly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">adding more stuff</a> to their games is well-documented, they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-plan-to-release-the-witcher-4-5-6-within-six-years-of-one-another-and-oh-are-those-pigs-flying">surely busy</a> focusing on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yet, the bit of paper, symbolising reporting from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">Europeanvideogamer</a> which cites claims by Polish industry whisper hearer Borys Nieśpielak, remains adamant such a thing is coming. Having initially claimed that an extra Witcher 3 DLC was in the works at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-remake">Witcher 1 Remake</a> developers Fool's Theory last summer, Nieśpielak's latest comments on the subject see him stick to his guns and point to a comment from CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">latest financial report</a> published late last year.</p>
<p>Said comment is from CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz, and came at the end of a discussion about the company's potential to achieve the upcoming moneymaking targets they've set. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results," the finance fellow said, not shedding any more light on said content.</p><p>Outside of Nieśpielak's claims and the vague financial report chat, a <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">Polish investing site</a> has reportedly cited Mateusz Chrzanowski - an analyst at investing firm <a href="https://noblesecurities.pl/">Noble Securities</a> - as having predicted "the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3" to be released in May 2026.</p>
<p>Gerry from the River thinks, scratching his white whiskers. It's all very strange. What would such a DLC even feature, assuming it's more than just a few extra bits of gear or similar stuff? A quest similar in scope to the brief mission added to the game with 2022's next-gen update, this time tying in with The Witcher 4 rather than Netflixy witchering?</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077's last few patches were pretty vehicle/transport heaving in terms of their additions, so maybe the option to take a scenic cart ride along the roads of the Northern Kingdoms if that's anything to go by? Perhaps the integration of some more popular mod - no, wait, that's it. The new mode of transport is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-3-mod-geralt-centaur-horse-man">this weird mod</a> which allows Geralt to run around as a half-man, half-horse centaur after blowing a magic horn finally being added to official Witcher canon. Then, boom, The Witcher 4 rocks up and Ciri's developed the ability to grow hooves on command, going on to have neigh problem founding the first Witcher school of the horse, much to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-a-relatively-important-plot-point-in-the-witcher-games-shouldnt-exist-at-all-so-says-the-books-author">the chagrin of Andrzej Sapkowski</a>.</p>
<p>Its secrets are stolen and animal melding magic becomes the latest problem to threaten The Continent, as mages begin taping bear claws and wolf mouths to themselves. To save the world, Ciri has to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Witcher3/comments/18s8fzg/do_ya_think_that_this_was_allusion_to_cyberpunk/">travel into Cyberpunk 2077 again</a> and have a set of mantis blades installed to teach these misbehaving magicians who's boss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Project Hadar</a> turns out to be the first game in a third CD Projekt series in which we follow a modern day half-dog Keanu Reeves as he tries to drag society away from a future of dystopian metropolises and instead towards a park-centric system of governance inspired by the game of fetch.</p>
<p>Or maybe it'll just be a couple of new swords, Gerry thinks as he gallops off to hunt another monster.</p>

            <p>
Before we begin the year’s first round-up of new PC game releases, an apology: we skipped feeding the Maw for one whole week back in December. In a deceptively carefree comment, I explained that I had too much seasonal blogmange to prepare, but this was actually a PR excuse to minimise hysteria. You see, back in November <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-skating-demon-tries-to-eat-the-moon-and-terminator-game-appropriately-rewrites-history">the Maw ate me</a>, and I have only just exited its digestive system. During past emergencies, I’ve done this by hooking onto gumlines and working my way from tonsil to tonsil. This time I forgot to bring my climbing axes, and was obliged to escape in… the other direction.
</p>
<p>
It is best not to share more. Thankfully, the Maw’s internal odours are only smellable in the 11th through 17th dimensions, though they can still be detected in Normie Spacetime – you may have noticed that all the reflections are pinstriped today. Anyway, now that I’ve properly explained the break in service, let’s gingerly dip our still-reeking fingers into the spumes of commerce. 
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 5th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Last year was all about horses. This year, perhaps, is the year of crabs. Step forward (or more likely, sideways) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833200/DuneCrawl/">Dunecrawl</a>, in which you and up to three other players roam a desert open world atop weaponised crustaceans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 6th January</h2>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4009730/Feed_the_Reactor/">Feed The Reactor</a> is an incremental clicker in which you drop different types of fuel into a cosmic vortex. Generating energy helps you level up the reactor and unpeel the narrative layers of a “strange galaxy”. An alien fishperson complains that they are always at war with Crustacea. See, crabs again.</li>
<li>Trigger-happy Satisfactory players and the mayoral kind of Helldiver might appreciate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture</a>, an early access game from the Green Hell devs in which you build outposts on planets and defend them against swarms of… crablike monsters?!?</li>
<li>There are 19 bosses in the fetchingly ghastly pixelart metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741830/Death_Machine/">Death Machine</a> and surely at least one of them is an invertebrate with eight legs, a carapace and large pincers.</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 7th January</h2>
<ul><li>Our next two offerings come from the worryingly crab-agnostic Julian. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/">Oddcore</a> - a deranged and fizzy FPS theme park of backroom spaces and dysfunctional corpo messaging. Seems lovely. No obvious crab presence though. Stop resisting progress, Julian.</li>
<li>Now this is more like it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">EvoCreo</a> is a creature collector with old school console (specifically, I’m thinking Game Boy Advance) graphics and turn-based combat. There are over 170 critters or Creos to bosh and bag. If one of the Creos isn’t a crab, I am going to call the Pokémon Company and complain that ilmfinity aren't ripping them off correctly.
</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 8th January</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933930/Ancient_Farm/">Ancient Farm</a> is an ancient farm simulator set in ancient Egypt. The wily bastards at A2 Softworks thought they could shirk their obligations to crabs by setting this on dry land, but then they slipped up and added rivers. Acanthothelphusa niloticus is coming for your ass, A2.</li></ul>
<h2>
Friday 9th January</h2>
<ul><li>If you were hoping for a feelgood game to close out the dingy first week of January, tough luck, you’re getting Ice-Pick Lodge’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> instead. 12 days to save the worst town bar possibly Silent Hill from a nightmare disease. Impose quarantines and roadblocks. Examine pustulating torsos. “Struggle to balance mania and apathy”. If there are crabs in this, they are the kind that live in your pubic hair. 
</li></ul>
<p>
Other vidyagame happenings this week: it’s time for another helping of hardware tradeshow CES in Las Vegas. James has set up a very large telescope on the Treehouse roof, and is combing the stalls for talk of GPU and RAM price changes, new screen formats, and novelty alarm clocks. For the most part, though, we’ll be spending this week firming up coverage plans for 2026. Like migrating Cuban red crabs, we must throw ourselves into the seas of discourse, striving to lay our writing-eggs before the tides return us to the shore.

            <p>It's a new year, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have kicked it off by revealing that the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod's second DLC is currently planned to rock up in the irradiated tube station of our lives pretty soon. This add-on's dubbed Last Orders and looks to have at least something to do with a trip to the pub.</p>
<p>To be fair, that makes perfect sense. Fallout: London's first DLC was dubbed Rabbit and Pork, so following up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">last year's meal of new quests</a> with a drink is only human.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team FOLON lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter announced Last Orders' target release window, the first quarter of 2026, in a couple of festive/new year announcements on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1455992215397732372">Fallout: London's Discord server</a>. "From 2026 onwards, things will be much less quiet," he wrote. "Expect quarterly updates and more shared content covering both Fallout: London and the future of Team FOLON Ltd.</p>
<p>"If you're here for the Last Orders DLC, we're very close, but it still needs testing and to go through the boring red tape. Our current aim is Q1 2026. Soon™. We hope to align this with another exciting update about something else..." In the earlier of the two posts, Carter added that the modders' reason for not totally committing to that early 2026 window right now is due to the fact the Rabbit and Pork DLC ended up taking longer than originally anticipated to finalise. "No promises though, not after last time," as the modder put it.</p><p>While Last Orders'll likely be surprisingly beefy if its predecessor's 30 new quests, 80 new characters, and 8000+ lines of dialogue are anything to go by, Fallout: London's third DLC remains the one I'm really keen to see arrive. Dubbed Wildcard, it's set to add in a cut questline designed to serve as the mod's version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>' Yes Man main quest path, something the modders were <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">initially forced to put on ice during development</a> due to the Russo-Ukrainian war's outbreak disrupting the life of the main modder working on it.</p>
<p>That DLC, the last of Fallout: London's currently announced add-ons, remains release dateless for now. Meanwhile, news about Last Orders has been accompanied by the arrival on Nexus Mods of fan-made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/786">Simplified Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/600">Japanese</a> translations for the massive mod, bringing down a couple more language barriers which might have prevented folks taking a trip to post-apocalyptic England thus far.</p>
<p>If Last Orders' current release plan holds fast, it looks like there'll be reason for radshrews of all tongues to consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-the-purple-haze-of-fallout-london-i-rage-mocked-by-the-violet-vistas-of-my-own-stupidity">giving Fallout: London another crack</a> at some point in the next few months.</p>
