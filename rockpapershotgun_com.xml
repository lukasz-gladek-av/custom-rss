How about that Steam Machine, 'ey? Consoles are now computers and computers are now consoles. What a topsy turvy world we're living in! I'm sure you have lots of questions, a lot of which I hope can be answered by James' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">hands-on look at the thing</a>, but you may still be wondering how you'll know what games will actually work on it. The Steam Deck has its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">fancy verified badge</a> that certifies that a game runs on the handheld, and it turns out that same badge is one that'll come in handy for the Steam Machine.
</p>
<p>
In a stunningly brief <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/563639634283728255">blog post</a> from Valve discussing its trio of hardware announcements, there's also a bit about what this all means for developers. No, don't run away, it's relevant to you too! Valve explains that its verified program will be expanded to include both the Steam Machine and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, promising more details soon. However! As they note, "if your games are already Steam Deck Verified, they'll automatically be verified on Steam Machine."
</p>
<p>
Essentially, it does sound like there will be unique verified badges for the Machine and the Frame, but any games you've hoarded for your Steam Deck thus far that are Steam Deck verified are already ready to go on that Steam Machine you've already bought in your head.
</p>
<p>
For those of you that actually are developers, Valve also says that they've launched a Steam Frame developer kit program. Apparently they're quite limited, but the company does plan to send kits out on an "ongoing basis."
</p>
<p>
So, when the next Steam sale approaches, and you notice that out of your list of 20 games, 17 of them are Deck verified, you can purchase safely knowing that they'll also be playable on Valve's sort-of-console. I'm sure this will help with your religious-scripture-length backlog.

Oh I do love a win! Today's is quite a surprising one, coming in the form of Jagex willingly removing some microtransactions from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> after more than 120,000 people voted in favour of having them permanently removed from the game. To be frank, I am genuinely unsure if I have… well, ever seen a company do this simply because everyone hated them so much.
</p>
<p>
To provide some context, Treasure Hunter is a daily activity that was introduced into the game in 2014, and essentially you can win prizes that can grant XP boosts, gold, and gameplay-skipping items. You'd only get a certain number of these for free a day, but it was also possible to buy extra keys with real money, which sucks a tremendous amount, obviously.

It's not just the Treasure Hunter microtransactions that are being removed, it's the entire system and then some. Come January 19th, 2026, the day this update will be implemented, 225 direct XP and skilling related items will also be gone from the game. According to Jagex, this is the start of what it's calling a year-long integrity roadmap, with the studio's CEO Jon Bellamy saying in a press release that they plan to tackle "some of the game's biggest friction points head-on."
</p>
<p>
January 19th will also see the arrival of a new RuneScape Ahead showcase which will go into a lot more detail about these roadmap plans, as well as other bits and bobs planned for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> across 2026.
</p>
<p>
I won't give outright kudos to Jagex for these changes, as we don't pat companies on the back for deciding they don't want to con people any more. But it is certainly a breath of fresh air at a time when just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-adding-pets-and-changing-your-invincible-banana-dogs-colour-will-require-buying-another-invincible-banana-dog">changing the skin of a virtual companion requires that you buy an entirely new companion first</a>. A hearty congrats to those that voted for the removal of these microtransactions, though. Hooray!
