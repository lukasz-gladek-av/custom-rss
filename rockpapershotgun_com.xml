            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios are cutting staff and closing their Liverpool, UK-based studio following Microsoft's cancellation of co-op smuggling game Contraband.
</p>
<p>Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">announced Contraband back in June 2021</a> in the form of a trailer replete with lockboxes, scribbly heist maps and Steely Dan music. There followed several years of almost complete silence, broken by news that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">over 500 Swedish staff had formed a union</a> in April 2024 - part of a wave of games industry labour activism in the face of widespread, "post-Covid" job-chopping.
</p>
<p>The positivity was not to last. In June 2024, Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-creators-avalanche-lay-off-50-people-and-close-their-montreal-and-new-york-studios">laid off 50 people and closed their New York and Montreal studios</a> to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company". Then, in August, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband">called time on Contraband</a>, shortly after laying off a bunch of Xbox developers and cancelling such games as Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">reboot of Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, Avalanche commented that "active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future". There's been some disagreement between Microsoft and reporters over whether the game is fully dead, or merely "on hold". I imagine it'll be on hold for a while, if they aren't any developers to work on it.
</p><p>Avalanche's <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement</a> about this week's reductions alludes to "current challenges to our business and the industry", but doesn't mention Contraband. The company propose to close their Liverpool studio, with a collective consultation process as required by UK law. "The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malm≈ë and Stockholm," the statement continues, "where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>Insert joke about London calling here, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have just released the first of the mod's planned three DLC packs. This one's called Rabbit and Pork and brings with it 30 new quests, plus a laundry list of that includes a bunch of NPCs, extra gear, and stability fixes.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">covered the other day</a>, to dive into the DLC and have the least chance of running into any bugs that could be lurking, you'll want to start a fresh run through post-apoclayptic Blighty.</p>

<p>"This major update doesn't just add new content, it reshapes parts of the game based on your feedback and fixes thousands of issues identified since launch," Team FOLON wrote in the DLC's Discord announcement. "We've poured a huge amount of effort into making this the most polished and complete experience possible."</p><p>Rabbit and Pork brings 30 new quests and minigames to the mod, along with 80 new characters for which 8000+ lines of chat have been recorded, I assume at least a third of those being in Cockney accents. Taking a quick gander at the release trailer, among the things which've stuck out to me are a mission involving a plane named after Fallout: London's protagonist, the wayfarer, and a visit to the Jack the Ripper museum.</p>
<p>As you explore, 30 new weapons and armours can be found, along with a new animal follower and a home to move into. 70 fresh random encounters and "new content for early faction introductions" round out the additions, while Team FOLON say the number of bug fixes and stability improvements number in the thousands.</p>
<p>"We‚Äôre also unveiling a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">brand-new custom launcher</a> designed alongside the Overwolf team to simplify the installation process for those who wish to use it," they add. "This one-click solution will alleviate the hassle of traditional mod installations and get players into the game faster and more reliably than ever akin to the GOG one-click installer."</p>
<p>In addition, the modders have rolled a number of key <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mods that help make the game a bit less likely to crash into this release, so the High FPS Fix, X-Cell and Buffout 4 no longer have to be grabbed seperately. Team FOLON recommend you uninstall them if you've already downloaded and installed them individually, to avoid duplication.</p><p>To round out the news, the modders have also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamfolon/team-folon-collectors-edition">launched a Kickstarter</a> for a Collector's Edition of Fallout: London. Something to consider backing if you fancy it in between mouthfuls of rabbit and pork. If you bounced off of Fallout: London the first time around due to its launch bugs, here's the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">review I wrote of it</a> for my old home.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, one of the infinite number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor studios that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">cropped up last year</a>, have been mostly quiet on whatever it is they've been cooking up since forming. They announced their existence with an evocative political manifesto, and today they revealed what's next. No, it's not a video game, but something a lot more physical, tangible, and interestingly old fashioned: a book.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply titled <a href="https://summereternal.com/anthology">Summer Eternal Anthology</a>, it's actually volume one of that planned anthology, which does run on the assumption that they manage to release another one. A press release from Summer Eternal describes it as "part cultural journal, part expedition log, part development diary," and, most unusually of all, "part physical game announcement."
</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigajadurwwllp7y737r3k3bib3pcpeenyol2hwqfzzlkax4rsx4bm" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:py672v7epr6tc6gxm7h5q7j4/app.bsky.feed.post/3m22ouv3jzk2b"><div lang="en"><p>INTRODUCING: Summer Eternal Anthology Volume One.

With the internet being the de facto place you announce a videogame these days, Summer Eternal are certainly doing something different here, more akin to magazine exclusives from days of yore. It's a bold move, and one they're hoping will support them financially, for this book is both an announcement teaser and a source of income in itself. There'll apparently be info on gameplay systems, the game's world, and how it all looks. Oh, and the game has a codename too, "Red Rooster."
</p><p>
Aside from that, you'll also find a few non-fiction essays, interviews, political thinkpieces related to the games industry, and a recap of what Summer Eternal have gone through to establish a worker-owned co-op. You'll have to wait a while for it though, as it's planned for spring 2026 earliest, summer 2026 latest.
</p>
<p>
In case you need a bit of a refresher on Summer Eternal as a studio compared to the other teams that boast of having former Disco devs on the books, this is the one co-founded by Argo Tuulik and Dora Klind≈æiƒá, both former writers at ZA/UM. You may remember that Tuulik and Klind≈æiƒá have had some legal back-and-forth with Riaz Moola, founder and owner of Longdue, a different supposed Disco successor.
</p>
<p>
Moola alleges that the pair violated a non-compete clause after they were previously employed by him, whereas Tuulik and Klind≈æiƒá claim that this particular clause covered a separate industry. People Make Games <a href="https://youtu.be/lZEAs6M1wts?si=enfye4e3OBsazepP">explored some of this particular legal battle</a> in a follow-up to their <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M?si=HafzykdWTFtfRgmb">original Disco Elysium/ ZA/UM documentary from 2023</a>, if you want a bit more depth.

Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you surround it with gunky visual metaphors for indentured servitude? Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you balance all the medulla-massaging twinkles and jingles against some gloating indications that the apparatus means you harm - drawerfuls of pink, polygonal flesh; shivery text that seems to crawl away from your eyes; a first-person camera that appears to be constantly hyperventilating; a trapdoor right beneath your feet? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">the Steam page disclaimer</a> that "CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!" Is a slot machine still a slot machine when it's a "sinister tale of addiction and escape" that also dangles the more-ish prospect of replay with different seeds or modifiers? Is a slot machine nothing more than a slot machine when it challenges you to "push your score to new heights in Endless Mode"?
</p>
<p>
Based on 20 minutes with CloverPit, I think the answer to all these questions is "no". I don't think CloverPit is a slot machine, even though it aims to be Endless, and I don't want to get it bluntly recategorised as an 18-rated experience or even removed from stores, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-junking-balatros-18-rating-pegi-will-develop-a-more-granular-rating-system-for-gambling-themes">as was the case with Balatro last year</a>. Still, I'm starting to find these ironic/satirical gambling simulators a bit, well, <em>too</em> cynical, in that I think we are perhaps trying to have our cynicism and eat it, just a smidge.
</p>
<p>
CloverPit released late last week, and there's still a demo on Steam. The basics of the game are that you're both gambling to pay off an ever-increasing debt, and slowly levelling up and optimising a slot machine by spending tokens - increasing the odds of certain symbols appearing, or how much they score, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Fail to keep up with your debts, and whoops, there goes the trapdoor. The play environment has some fun widgets: you can remind yourself of the modifiers in play by conversing with a horrible toy phone on wheels. I'm quite interested in how they've found the balance between enticing and unpleasant in the design of those chunkily retro, blood-spattered visual props.
</p><p>
There are a lot of roguelikes with nudge-wink casino themes, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck be a Landlord</a> through the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a> and various gamble-nots on Itch.io that haven't quite broken through the crust. At a glance, many have the same rough punchline: living under capitalism is a gaudy grind for a fleeting pittance beset by chronic indignity and unfairness, so why not laugh at your own helplessness. Why not revel in it?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can defeat the system from inside, but even if you can't, there's some catharsis to derive from seeing the system for what it is. Also, yanking the wrist of a one-arm bandit is Fun - even "addictive", in the words of one of CloverPit's professional reviews, but you know, addictive with a knowing smirk. Addictive in an above-it-all way.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I myself am nudging and winking towards is a proper longform accounting of comically gambling-adjacent roguelikes that queries them for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">signs of more obvious hypocrisy</a>, and perhaps chucks in some analysis of the inherently gamblery nature of the roguelite at large - a genre predicated upon but not reducible to randomisation and repetition. You'd have to weave in some thoughts about habit-forming elements in non-roguelite games - lootboxes, level-up noises, that kind of stuff. You'd have to talk about learned helplessness and defeatism as they are potentially manifest in entertainment works.</p>
<p>Ugh, now that I've smooshed together an outline, I don't want to write this, not least because I think I had much the same ideas five years ago, and either didn't follow through or wrote them up and forgot. I am spinning my wheels. Anyway, you might want to try CloverPit's demo, or watch a streamer try their luck. It's been doing well on the Steamvine - partly, I suspect, because it's solid reaction-video fare. Horror games tend to be a good fit for streamers. Still, I think I'm going to go back to playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, for the minute.
