            <p>Are you sitting down, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>? It's alright. I've just got...some news I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this. A modder's decided to put a bunch of Fortnitey emotes and dances inside you.</p>
<p>We can see the likes of dabs, the NaeNae, and even a stanky legg on the scans. They're cranking it, spanking that, and Snoop Dogging all over your internal organs too. There's nothing we could have done. That surgery which ported you from 2006 to 2025 increased the risk of this drastically, but how else were 12 year olds supposed to learn about the need to CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We could rage against the cause of these symptoms, modder CosmicBoogaloo with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/5039?tab=description">Dance and Emote Animation Pack</a>. We could curse them in the name of the divines, of the Aedra, or even the Daedra. We could subjugate ourselves before Dagon himself, calling on his lust for revolution to grant us the malign powers required to reverse this regrettable chain of events.</p>
<p>We could crusade with the fury of Pelinal Whitestrake against any and all who download the mod, and go on to press one of the keys it assigns a Fortnitey dance or emote to. We could cast their characters, mid-subtle dab or weird bottomless twerk, into the fiery pits of The Deadlands, where they'd inevitably float around going 'UGGGH', 'OOOOAGGHH', and 'NYYYYUUGGHHH'.</p>

<p>We could outlaw its 19 emotes and 20 dances, including the ability to make it rain despite the fact that this province lacks paper money and criss crosses you can dougie into a running man before movin' like Bernie. We could instruct every legion guard to stop violators of this anti-taunting legislation with deadly force. We could yell from the summit of the White-Gold Tower: 'You there in the Arena district, cease flexing those muscles and woohooing at once, or else incur the wrath of mighty Akatosh!'</p>
<p>We could do all of that, but it wouldn't matter. Those who wish to use this profane mod have likely already grabbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/UE4SS%20for%20Oblivion%20Remastered">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1172">Simple BP Mod Loader</a>. </p>
<p>The dabbage is irreversible.</p>
