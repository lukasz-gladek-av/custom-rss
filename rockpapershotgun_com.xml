            <p>Once upon a time, Alice B (RPS in peace) was frustrated that the villagers in Early Access medieval townbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foundation">Foundation</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-furious-idiot-villagers-will-not-eat-their-bread-and-now-theyre-starving">would not eat their bread</a> and were furiously starving. Then it turned out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-i-was-the-one-starving-my-foundation-villagers-all-along-my-bad">Alice was the one starving them</a>. Hoho! Pure japes.
</p>
<p>Five years later, Foundation has just hit 1.0.

<p>The 1.0 update sounds substantial, from the number of new, improved and revamped features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/690830/view/507318638682833727">in this Steam news post</a>. It includes a coat of arms editor, new types of residential housing, a less restrictive progression system, and my favourite, "new and improved walls". This is referring to the kind of walls that wrap around and fortify your village, but I like to imagine they mean just all the walls.
</p>
<p>I really don't want to undersell the size of the update. One of the other subheadings is "a completely revamped art direction." No minor final tweaks are these.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the scale of these changes, some Early Access saves will no longer be compatible with the 1.0 release. If that means you, you can still access older version of the game within Steam by heading to the game properties, hitting up the beta tab, and selecting 'early_access_1_9' in the dropdown. Mods will also need updating, and as such are not currently available immediately after the 1.0 launch.
</p><p>Apparently the developers plan to continue to support the game with new quality-of-life updates, modding features and tools and more, as well as DLC in due course. Whether any of this will allow Alice B to live down her bread shame, I do not know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> recently dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafts-beta-versions-now-offer-adorable-hot-and-cold-pig-variants">pig variants</a> into beta, giving porkly variants in cold and warm climates. The other barnyard animals were presumably breighing and neighing from the neglect, but here comes a solution: cows are getting cold cow and warm cow variants, too.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The cold climate bovine seems clearly modelled to resemble the highland cow - which I am nation-bound to call the best cow, because it is. The warm cow is a deeper shade of brown and that's fine, too.
</p>
<p>This same salvo of updates also adds a firefly bush, which grow near bodies of water and glow when night falls. You can apparently dig these up and bury them below other blocks "to make them sparkle". No word on how the fireflies feel about that. There's also an ordinary bush to be found in foresty, greenery biomes and new ambient desert sounds. 
</p>
<p>All of the above is now available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft-java-edition">Minecraft: Java Edition</a>'s snapshot beta. They'll come to Bedrock's beta later - although Bedrock players now have access to the crunchy leaf litter and decorative wildflowers that entered beta with the pig variants earlier this month.
</p><p>My son and I have recently transitioned from Bedrock to Java Edition, to give us access to more skins and mods. He's playing on the Steam Deck, which poses extra challenges in making everything run smoothly. It also means that I won't be installing any Java Edition betas anytime soon, because a lot of mods tend to lag behind even Minecraft's fully released updates.
</p>
<p>Who needs updates anyway when we've got Ollie's list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-mods">best Minecraft mods</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
