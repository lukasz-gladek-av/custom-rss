            <p>A work-in-progress version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s first big post-release patch is now testable on Steam, so you can hop in and check out the changes Funcom's making early doors before it rolls out for everyone in a few weeks.</p>
<p>A bunch of the changes the game's devs teased or confirmed during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">their recent AMA </a>and letter to players haven't found their way into the patch, or at least this early version. Though, you'll at least be able to try out PvE in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">the Deep Desert</a>, something folks have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">demanded en-masse</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside pointing folks to the freshly launch Dune: Awakening Public Test Client on Steam, where you can now test out patch 1.1.10.0, Funcom have released <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-public-test-client/">the notes</a> outlining what's in it.</p>
<p>Among the highlights is the news that "the PvE area near the shield wall has been expanded to cover row A, B, C, D and half of E within the Deep Desert." So, you'll be able to check out some Deep Desert PvE, which folks had been calling for to avoid being forced into PvP during Awakening's endgame, when you're hunting for the best gear and resources.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sleepers, we have news!</p><p>Patch 1.1.10.0 is now live on the new Public Test Client.

<p>I have noticed a few folks on the social arguing that this PvE expansion is too big an adjustment - we'll have to see what the consensus is. Outside of that, Funcom have "reduced the frequency of Harkonnen attacks on certain Atreides bases (and vice versa) in Hagga Basin", set up the main menu's play now button to filter out private servers, and made sure "sandworms now linger for a bit around spicefields that have been recently harvested from".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can now use, claim and list items straight to and from the inventory of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-get-ornithopter">Ornithopter</a> in the exchange. There are a bunch of handy minor tweaks to everything from base building to vehicles, combat and the UI. However, if you're hungry for the big PvP changes that the devs have teased, adjustments to the Landsraad, or just the ability to deposit all of your stuff at once, you'll have to keep waiting.</p>

            <p>Yesterdayâ€™s launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 laptop GPU was quiet, yet nonetheless featured a surprise: thereâ€™s also a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/rtx-5050-desktop-gpu-and-laptops/">desktop version of the RTX 5050</a>, set to release (exclusively in third-party garb â€“ thereâ€™s no Founders Edition) in "the second half" of July. Quite the turnaround for the non-laptop XX50 lineage, which was widely assumed extinguished following 2022â€™s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-review">RTX 3050</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5050 will replace the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> as the cheapest of Nvidia's current-gen desktop GPUs, starting at $249. Budget buyers will need to make do with 8GB of last-gen GDDR6 VRAM, however, as well as a lighter smattering of CUDA cores: 2,560 to the RTX 5060â€™s 3,840. Thereâ€™s obviously no desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-on-the-rtx-4050s-appeal-has-grown-but-better-laptop-gpus-loom">RTX 4050</a> to compare these specs to, though next to the RTX 3050, it does offer more memory bandwidth even if the total gigabyte count remains the same. Presumably there are also performance advantages, especially where ray tracing is concerned, that the RTX 5050 can glean from its updated Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>'Course, while the RTX 5050 might make for a decent upgrade for current 3050 owners â€“ especially those interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> and frame generation â€“ its $249 price tag does keep it nervily close to the $300 RTX 5060. Which, even with its driver issues, really isnâ€™t a bad 1080p card itself, so weâ€™ll have to see what the 5050 can do to coexist with its more core-rich, wider-bandwidth big brother.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll admit, thereâ€™s a not-small part of me that hopes it can. We can raise eyebrows at the specifications and make "Fnar fnar new GTX 1030" jokes until our typing fingers are worn down to stumps, but there genuinely are vast numbers of PC players who are happy with below-max quality 1080p yet canâ€™t reliably stretch to mid-rangers like the XX60 series. People, in other words, who havenâ€™t been adequately served by the GPU market in years. Arguably since even before the RTX 3050, what with that GPU launching during the dark times of COVID-compounded shortages and price gouging.</p>
<p>Will the RTX 5050 fill that gap? I wonâ€™t know until Iâ€™ve tested one out. But Iâ€™d rather it ends up as a failed attempt, than a repeat of the RTX 40 series' failing to try at all.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-desktop-grade-nvidia-rtx-5050-after-all-and-its-out-next-month]]></content:encoded>
