            <p>The rough beast that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has cracked its shell and slouched towards the wincing light of day. They've released it, I mean. No verdict from us yet: our reviewer is still picking their way among the exploding motorbikes and mocking spectres of deceased Nicaraguan terrorists. But I can at least tell you with some confidence that if you're a fan of pausing games or mid-mission checkpoints, you might want to give it a miss.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">Eurogamer</a>, neither pausing, nor mission checkpoints, nor playing the game offline are allowed in the new Blops, thanks in part to its heavy focus on four player co-op play. You cannot look away from Blops anymore: it has become the Eye of Sauron, transfixing you from across the coffee table as it zooms to flaming close-up. Your time belongs to the cod! It sleeps with the fishes. Damn, I could see a mafia-themed Call of Duty set in Mordor, actually. It doesn't sound like this would be wholly out of synch with the endgame, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-basically-gun-speed-dating-and-its-endgame-is-a-big-fight-in-map-soup">entangles maps from Blopses gone by</a>. Collage Of Duty, they definitely aren't calling it.</p>
<p>This isn't the first Call Of Duty campaign to be always-online. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-missed-that-the-black-ops-6-campaign-is-always-online-but-fortunately-its-not-too-late-to-throw-a-wobbly">Black Ops 6 went there too</a>, and that game sold like hot yellowcake uranium, so clearly a significant proportion of you aren't fussed. Still, no mission checkpoints?</p>
<p>There are other and more pressing reasons to no-sell the new Call Of Duty. It's being published by Microsoft, who like buying studios for billions and then laying loads of people off, and who continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">do business</a> (despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">individual divestments</a>) with armies participating in what the UN has formally termed a genocide. We did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">a big report</a> on protests against the company's Israeli military connections earlier in the year.</p>
