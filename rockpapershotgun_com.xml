Right, anybody fancy a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> update? Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/deep-field-games">Deep Field Games</a> did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one. As you can probably guess by the title of the update, there's a bit of a chill coming, specifically in a new area called the Residence Sector. This new locale has "something" going on that's making it a bit too cold for anyone to hang out in, though the mystery behind it is something you'll likely have to play to discover.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Then there's the new upgrade system that'll come with this update. Once you reach a certain tier you'll be able to build a new station that'll let you improve your weapons, armour, "and a few other item types", which sounds like it'll make certain instances in the game a little less stressful. It also seems like you'll be able to reset your character, and the room you do it in definitely doesn't look cold and unwelcoming.
</p>
<p>
One big thing that will be changing is base assaults, because as Deep Field Games put it, they "kinda stink." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543352686106378315?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing the update explains that while portal storms are generally working as intended, there are "several cases, mostly non-Pest related assaults, where they will simply spawn inside your base or in the same spot over and over." As a result of this, some big changes have been made to how bases are detected, and Deep Field Games are hoping that assaults should feel "a lot more unique and varied."
</p>
<p>
On the smaller end of new additions in the update, and possibly my favourite of everything that's coming with it, is the fact that bins can be used as bins. Got something you don't want? Just chuck it in there! Gotta love it when a game has tiny little functions like this.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when this update will arrive just yet, so we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled in the meantime.

You know, I've always loved me a sky island in a video game. Can't really tell you why, I just think they're neat! So right from the get go I was pretty easily won over by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a>, another one of those open world survival crafting type games. It's a genre I'm not easily won over by, I don't care for building things all that much, but the pull of the open air is pretty alluring to me. And I won't even have very long to see if I'll bounce off of its craftiness or not, because developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bossa-studios">Bossa Studios</a> announced today that Lost Skies is releasing into early access later this month on April 18th.

Being one of those kinds of games, there's the usual kinds of things you can expect in terms of building things, though the main thing you'll be building is your skyship. It looks pretty intricate too, lots of different parts you can attach and wiggle around. You can then take your ship out on large scale dogfights, which look a bit intimidating to be honest, but I'm sure a seasoned enough crew will be fine.

Speaking of your crew, you can play with up to five friends (or enemies, I suppose, that just doesn't sound very fun) as you explore the game's first region, the Outskirts. Future updates will apparently expand this area, as well as add in more places to explore, alongside general bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and a few additional features.
</p>
<p>
One thing I quite like is the game's Island Creator, which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/">already download separately</a>. This is exactly what it sounds like, you can build and design your own islands, and in the main game you'll be able to download islands other people have made. Honestly this looks like enough of a game in its own right, kudos to Bossa Studios for fitting something like this in.
</p>
<p>
If you're not an early access person, Bossa Studios said they are currently planning to release it into 1.0 sometime this year, but otherwise, you can check it out April 18th.
