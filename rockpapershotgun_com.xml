            <p>"Attacking is the most consistent element of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s gameplay," says director Junya Ishizaki in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/elden-ring-nightreign-interview-reimagined-game-design-anchored-by-in-depth-combat">new PlayStation blog</a>, explaining the choice to have players revive each other by hitting wounded mates with swords - a famously crucial tenet of the hippocratic oath. "We tested to see if it would work for resuscitation, and we discovered a wide variety of tactics depending on range, frequency, and probability, so we formally implemented it. We also found it quite amusing (laughs)."</p>

<p>Crux of FromSoft right there, I reckon: expert awareness over when to trim the fat, absolute lack of self-consciousness over being goofy as hell while doing it. Nightreign is set for release at the end of the month, 30th May, but despite us being in the midst of hypetown, the PlayStation interviewer shattered my expectations for a promotional blog by actually positing a potential negative about the game. A FromSoft game, no less! Your bravery has not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>"After playing the network test, while I enjoyed building my characters, I also felt like the strategy aspect became a little repetitive. Can we expect more unpredictability that encourages players to be more tactical, in the final product?" they ask.</p>
<p>"We’re also pursuing that approach," replies Ishizaki. "The same strategy won’t always work when fighting the bosses. Your initial strategy may be effective for a while, but the bosses will gradually evolve and your tactics will no longer be viable, forcing you to rethink your approach."</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Ishizaki means by "evolve" here - it's one of those vague marketing words developers like to use. It could be a reference to the second, more powerful phases FromSoft bosses traditionally have when you've beaten them up a bit, stat modifiers, or simply that different bosses act differently. I'd love it to be an Arkham Mr. Freeze situation, obviously, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>"In the final version of the game, you’ll be able to determine the weakness of each boss before heading out," Ishizaki continues. "So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run. Taking advantage of their susceptibility will give you an edge in the fights. We intentionally designed the game so that you’ll need to adapt and evolve your strategies along with the changes that happen in the game."</p>
<p>There's that evolve word again, but this all broadly sounds within the spirit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> to me. Ishizaki goes on to talk about some tweaks following the recent network tests, such as more player guidance. He also chats a bit about designing the playable characters as fantasy archetypes for common builds. "A character like a  ‘macho wizard’ may exist if there were a hundred variations, but it’s a bit too eccentric when we only have a few playable characters". Here's a D&amp;D 5e homebrew wiki page <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Wizard_(5e_Class)">for a Muscle Wizard</a>, in case you're as disappointed by this news as I am.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, 8th May, is a day of compound darkness, for it sees the release of (at least) two games with "midnight" in the title: Midnight Special from Scared Stupid Inc, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from Moonhood. A coincidence? Absolutely not. This is clearly an occult configuration of daunting power. It's also an opportunity to briefly compare two video game aesthetics, each comparably dense, tasty and insidious.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Midnight Walk is from them wot did animal fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fe">Fe</a>, which I appreciated but did not much enjoy, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>. It casts you as a cindery explorer, The Burnt One, who must help a chibi lantern bro called Potboy through a beautifully unpleasant world of gouged and shrunken clay surfaces and twitchy, stop-motion-style creatures. "Survive and outsmart the many monsters eager to devour your little friend's flame as you experience five tales of fire and darkness, featuring an incredible cast of odd characters," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">the Steam page</a> comments.

<p>
It's a first-person "dark adventure" with an emphasis on puzzling and using your noodle, but it does feature guns - hunky plasticene blunderbusses that wouldn't seem out of place in Doom, except that you appear to be very small in The Midnight Walk, small enough to sit on Doomguy's knuckle, wield a matchstick like a torch, or shelter beneath the pages of a dropped book. The world is perhaps more of a hive: you'll meet dreadful insects with hinged facemasks. I find it all quite appealing, though the stop-motion craftsmanship here feels quite sheeny and varnished next to the purposefully ramshackle splendour of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a>.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Special is another keg of giblets entirely. It's a horror point-and-clicker that takes inspiration from 16-bit adventure games together with various cinematic movements and genres: "the gory thrills of giallo, the suspense of slashers, and the otherworldly charm of 70s and 80s sci-fi". The year is 1978, the place is somewhere in Maine, and you are a babysitter exploring a labyrinthine manor. It's a game of four episodes: today's early access release nets you the Pilot episode encompassing "the first half of the house", though there's currently a free Prologue demo as well.

<p>
It seems less of an enclosed dark fantasy, and more openly steeped in the material culture of various periods than The Midnight Walk. There are nods to Steamboat Willy and older Macintosh desktop displays, for example. It's also bloodier and I think, more horrible in how it couples smearier bits of pixellation with the torments of the flesh. Still, at least there are no flap-faced Burtonesque spiders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/">You can read more on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please choose one of these games for further consideration and possibly, a purchase. I advise you not to play both, for there can only be <em>one</em> midnight. What dire cosmic consequences will you unleash, if you conjure the sunset twice over and investigate these elaborate, storied and allusive visual artefacts side by side? Don't come crying to me in the comments if tomorrow never dawns.

            <p>Necromancy is a dark art, forbidden by the mages guild in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> Remastered. At least, that's what characters in the open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will tell you, before selling you a spell that lets you raise skellingtons from the dirt. You can be promoted to the head of the Mages Guild, in spite of all those corpses you keep bringing back to life. Necromancy banned? Seems like no one cares.</p>
<p>Well, one modder has fixed that. The mod, simply titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1188">"Necromancy Is Actually Banned"</a>, will see you expelled from the Mages Guild if you perform any necrotic abracadabras in sight of a fellow member. You can also get fined by the guards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Necromancy has been banned by the Mages Guild yet nobody cares if you use undead summons. This mod fixes that," reads a description for the mod on Nexus Mods. "In addition, while not illegal in the lore, optionally you can choose to have summoning undead result in a 100-gold bounty if done near a guard. This makes Necromancy feel like something you really need to hide."</p>
<p>The mod adds one other touch to make necromancy feel more like an underground act of scumbaggery. Spells that let you summon the undead can no longer be bought from Mages Guild vendors, but you'll still find them sold by other, less reputable, magic users (hello <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Shady_Sam">Shady Sam</a>, one tome of Headless Zombie, please). Or you can find them on necromancer corpses. Which I'm sure you won't reanimate - it's illegal. </p>
<p>Considering a lot of righteous quests involve hunting down necromancers and zombie-raising ill-doers, there is definitely a sense that this practice is seen as disgusting, immoral, and wrong in the Elder Scrolls world. That so few characters care if you do it near them is arguably just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">one of Oblivion's silly charms</a>, like becoming so good at crouching it renders you immediately invisible in broad daylight. But it's nice to have a mod that makes characters react in the way you might expect. </p>
<p>You will need to use another mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> to make certain changes to character dialogue work with this one, though, says the creator of the necromod "MadAborModding". </p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

"Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil," a random NPC will often tell you in Oblivion, "but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the Mages Guild has banned it." At least now, with this mod, that statement will feel a little more accurate. Modding for the Oblivion Remastered has not received any official support, but it's booming nonetheless, with nearly 2000 mods uploaded to Nexus Mods so far. Even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/some-old-mods-from-2008-still-work-in-oblivion-remastered">old mods for the original 2008 game still work</a>.
