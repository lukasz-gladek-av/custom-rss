            <p>Floating amid the scrap belts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>, some news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> is now owned by developers Blackbird Interactive, with the studio having bought control of the ship-stripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> from publishers Saber Interactive. They're not having a rest after cracking open that bubbly either, writing that "multiple Hardspace projects" are in development.</p>
<p>Blackbird revealed all of this via a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718">Steam post</a>, writing that they've "reached an agreement with Focus Entertainment, our publishing partner, to reacquire full ownership of the Hardspace: Shipbreaker intellectual property". So, as you might expect, doing plenty of Hardspacey things is going to be a big part of the studio's plans going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To that end, they revealed here that "multiple Hardspace projects are already in development". "We're not ready to share any specifics yet, but rest assured we have paid close attention to your feedback and are laser-focused on ensuring this next generation of Hardspace expands on the original game in all the right ways," Blackbird added.</p>
<p>In the run up to releasing these new games, the studio aim to "grow the Hardspace community", urging folks to join the series' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FYEcBqgHa">Discord server</a>, where breaking updates will be launched into your orbit whenever they're ready. You can also <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/">pre-register for the "LYNX Pioneer Program" via Blackbird's website</a>, if you fancy the chance to take part in early playtests and offer feedback on future Hardspace games. There's some other community stuff like contests and the chance to generally chat with devs included in that too.</p>
<p>Also, Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself will be getting a "small update" that'll mainly take care of housekeeping details to indicate the change in ownership, like revamping the privacy policies and splash screens.</p>
<p>Our Liam wrote the following about the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-review-moreish-sci-fi-work-sim-sticks-the-landing">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What a thrill, to exist on the sidelines. To look longingly out towards the stars and wonder what’s going on beyond your little corner of this expansive universe. To understand a society purely through its waste products. Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a truly marvellous thing to spend time within. I quite like being a background character, it turns out. Being the hero is overrated. If Shipbreaker has taught me anything it’s that the satisfaction of a hard day's work beats saving the universe every single time.</blockquote>
<p>There are also thoughts on it from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-and-the-joy-of-doing-a-boring-spacejob-perfectly">Alice O</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-want-to-like-hardspace-shipbreaker-but-im-very-bad-at-it-and-it-makes-me-sad">Alice B</a>, if you're keen to fill your Alice quota.</p>
