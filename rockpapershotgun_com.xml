Supergiant Games have released the latest big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> today, The Unseen Update, bringing in a number of changes so big I won't be able to tell you about them all here, but I'll pick out a few good ones. First of all, and perhaps most importantly, Narcissus finally has character art and, oh no, he's hot! I'm not going to embed any pictures of him here just in case you want to witness him in game for yourself, but here's a little <a href="https://x.com/belllmonts/status/1935026960461140303">tweet</a> for those that can't wait. Very much a "why does he have to be obsessed with himself and be attractive enough for that to be understandable" kind of vibe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, you can put the spray bottle down, I'll tell you about some gameplay additions. All of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms now have their own Hidden Aspects for you to unlock, though you'll have to find them yourself. Some new music has been added in too, including a "hot new single from a certain band…" Zero prize for guessing this is likely to be Scylla and the Sirens.
</p>
<p>
Several, optional new events have been added in for when you get close to a number of the game's characters, and there's even some new artwork for certain characters in the salt bath (and some "visual flourishes" have been added to the artwork in general). There's a new Vow of Rivals feature that makes each Guardian (i.e. boss) "more challenging in unique ways; the first Rank affects the first Guardian of both the Underworld and Surface routes; prevail against both to reveal the next Rank, and so on."
</p>
<p>
There's also just a ridiculously long list of additions and tweaks to boons, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, Hexes, enemies, and more, so you're probably going to want to read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548">full patch notes</a> if you like to dig that deep.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-unseen-update/">blog post</a> on their website, Supergiant Games also offered up some development progress. While they didn't have a release date to share, after some follow-up patches to iron out some Unseen Update kinks, the big next steps will be adding in the game's anticipated true ending. There's also plans for achievements and other finishing touches, but the big thing here is that they are gearing up for the 1.0 release at the very least. For now, just uh, drool over Narcissus or something.

Welp! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has been delayed. The writing was not only on the wall, but on the floors, the doors, the ceiling, cripes, how did it hit that one spot? A lukewarm (at best) reception mixed with a discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">wholesale lifted the work of another artist without permission</a> all led to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">reported free fall of morale at the studio</a>, so this is honestly the least surprising thing in the world. In any case, let's look at the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">post Bungie made</a> explaining their decision to delay the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear," Bungie wrote. "We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release." Worth noting here that a replacement date hasn't been set, so this seems like quite a big one.
</p>
<p>
Bungie outlined some key areas that they plan to focus on with this delay too. For one, they plan on making it more challenging and making the AI encounters more engaging. They intended to make runs feel more rewarding with "new types of loot and dynamic events," and to make combat "more tense and stratetigc."
</p>
<p>
There are a few interesting lines too. They plan on "doubling down on the Marathon Universe" with "increased visual fidelity", "more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with," and a "darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy." A lot of the complaints I've seen anecdotally have been about the presentation of the story, which has felt very unclear.
</p>
<p>
Bungie also quite vaguely wrote that they'll add in more social experiences, part of that being a better experience for solo and duos, and the addition of proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life." The solo and duos part will be welcome news to many, as being forced into trios was offputting to a lot of people. I hope that there's something akin to a hub area to hang out in too, Destiny is very much a hang out and vibe kind of game, and it's why people like the series.
</p>
<p>
The post ends with the studio saying that they'll have more to share in the fall/ autumn, including the game's new release date. It's quite clear that Bungie, and presumably Sony/ PlayStation, are afraid of a bomb, something all involved parties will be desperate to avoid. The ghost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> can still be felt, after all.
</p>
<p>
I don't expect this to be a minor delay. While Bungie didn't go into a huge amount of specifics, they outlined a lot of big changes. I'm not confident that they can all be fixed in less than a year. We'll find out in due time.
