            <p>
Gearbox and Take-Two recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">brought forward the release</a> of giggling gunslinger <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> from 23rd September to 12th September. This came a week or two after Bungie and Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">also decided</a> to release their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot on 23rd September. 
</p>
<p>
If you thought all that was evidence of publishers playing 4D chess around the currently unannounced release date of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, with Bungie and Sony making the fair assumption that Take-Two won't release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 on the same day... then you were mistaken. You should be ashamed to speculate in this fashion! Pshaw! Harrumph! Damn your eyes, sir, and damn the stalking horse you rode in on.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
So says Gearbox chieftain Randy Pitchford, who has climbed the parapets of social media to insist that the new Borderlands is only shipping early because it's super, duper good, and not because Gearbox are trying to avoid either an elevator fight with Marathon <em>or</em> the undivulged impact site of the incoming GTA 6 meteor, which will surely obliterate the sales of any game foolish enough to ship in close proximity. 
</p>
<p>

"Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">wrote</a> Pitchford. "Our decision is literally 0% about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date." 
</p>
<p>
As is the lot of many chieftains standing on parapets, Pitchford is getting a lot of heat for these assertions that Borderlands 4 is simply too darn brilliant to consign to the wastelands of late September. The Xitter replies are damning: three Dr Evil fingerquote gifs and counting, also a Pinocchio, an Anchorman, and several side-eyeing dogs. Now to see if Marathon, too, undergoes a sudden excess of confidence and brings its release date forward a few weeks. The Great Game continues.
</p>
<p>According to what we know for sure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">GTA 6 will release in fall 2025</a>. "There is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick commented in November. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Hitting the big 1-0 with dozens of compatibility fixes</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/proton">Proton</a>, the compatibility software co-developed by Valve and CodeWeavers for helping Windows games run on Linux – and, thus, the foundation for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – is getting its first full version update in nearly a year. Proton 10.0 is now available in beta form, heralding compatibility fixes and improvements in enough games that I gave up bothering to do an accurate count. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-10.0-1b">Loads, basically</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Changes in this milestone update range from the addressing of specific issues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> Enhanced, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a> to the gift of SteamOS compatibility with games that previously lacked it entirely. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> Game of the Year Edition, which are currently listed as Unsupported for the Deck on their respective Steam pages – once Proton 10.0 gets a stable branch launch, those ratings may need to be reviewed. Indeed, when I set Arkham Asylum to run using the beta, it worked perfectly, having failed to get past the launcher on Proton 9.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck fixes in 10.0 either. The patch notes also promise amendments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> – among others – crashing on Intel GPUs, so the update has Linux-based desktop users in mind as well. Incidentally, Marvel Rivals had a less productive coming-together with Proton earlier this year, the software being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-unbans-steam-deck-and-mac-players-wrongly-caught-up-in-cheater-purge">mistakenly flagged as a cheating tool</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these fixes have been included in past updates to Proton Experimental, or were beaten to the punch by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a>: an unofficial, custom build that takes advantage of Proton’s open-sourcedness to pack in even more compatibility tweaks. Even so, Valve/CodeWeaver’s beta builds are inherently more polished and bug-light than Experimental versions, and unlike Proton GE, don’t need any side jaunts into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> to get working.</p>
<p>Between that readiness of use and the current lack of timeframe on when 10.0 might get a stable release, the beta is arguably worth trying out now if you’ve suffered any of the compatibility problems it claims to have sorted out. Proton beta versions also work on the stable branch of SteamOS, so you don’t need to switch to the operating system’s beta branch as well, and installation is a cinch: just search for the Proton 10.0 beta in your Steam library, and you can download it from there as if it were a game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
