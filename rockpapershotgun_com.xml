            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invisible-inc">Invisible Inc</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dont-starve">Don't Starve</a> developers Klei Interactive have announced Away Team, a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">base-building game</a> from the same universe as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxygen-not-included">Oxygen Not Included</a>. I have yet to play Oxygen Not Included, but Klei seldom miss - their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a> remains one of my favouritest ninja shankfests - and Away Team already seems very appealing for putting a deeply inhumane emphasis on traitorous physics. Here be trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In offering a world in which "every tile is simulated", Away Team is both daring comparisons with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> and building on the volatile foundations of Oxygen Not Included, which Nate (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oxygen-not-included-review">called</a> "a machine for procedurally generating engineering problems, and due to the huge number of physical properties interacting in the simulation, they will never be the same twice".</p>
<p>In Away Team, you are a solitary Oxygen Not Included colonist, aka Duplicant, who has mistakenly pushed a big red button and rocketed off to a strange new world. Equipped with a vacuum gun, you must explore the depths and craft your own abode from all the materials you find. You will need food and oxygen. Also, a working understanding of conductivity. And a very careful aim.</p>
<p>This is a realm in which every piece of matter is subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Liquids flow and evaporate. Fires spread, given access to flammable materials. I don't remember things being so... temperamental in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> away missions, but I would have happily watched a million episodes of a show in which Captain Picard spends 29 minutes gingerly carving out acid vats, then says "oh shit" just before the credits roll.</p>
<p>Away Team has yet no release date, but it does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168390/Away_Team/">a Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
