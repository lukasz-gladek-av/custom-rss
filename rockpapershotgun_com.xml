            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/painkiller">Painkiller</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> studio People Can Fly will be co-developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears Of War: E-Day</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter-first-person">shooter</a> in the long-running series of games about large men doing large violence at large bugs from behind medium walls. This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games">pronounced horror slant</a>, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.  </p>

<p>This is good news, also, because last year was a fraught one for People Can Fly. Back in January, we learned from an email obtained by Kotaku that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">Polish studio were laying off 30 people</a>, alongside 20 people being moved from an unannounced Square Enix project named Gemini. They cancelled another project - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">a co-op action RPG named Project Dagger</a> - in April. Last December, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">parted wallets with a further 120 workers</a>, shelved one project, and downsized another. "We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," said chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski at the time.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed every People Can Fly game I've played, including Outriders - an excellent shooter, albeit one buried under a clumpy mountain of pre-peed live service cat litter. As for E-Day, it's primed to be a soft series reboot of sorts. "Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," said The Coalition studio head Mike Crump in a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/">press release</a>. "We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p><p>Gears Of War has always been an interesting series to me because it initially got my - and I imagine a lot of other people's - attention <a href="https://youtu.be/wy8LRlS1SCc">through an emotional beat in a trailer</a> that never really found its analogue in the actual games themselves. I sort of get the sense that's what E-Day is aiming for, especially if the strains of Mad World in the above teaser are any indication. I haven't kept up with the series all that closely over the years though, so I'm not sure how often they milk that song in marketing. I imagine it's probably a lot now I think about it. Either way, It's been long enough that I could absolutely go for some big man chainsaw misery. Perhaps in 2025, though no confirmation on that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
