            <p>Amazon’s colonial fantasy MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> (latterly rebranded New World: Aeternum) is no longer available for purchase as of yesterday, and will be taken offline for good from 31st January 2027, the publishers have announced. The news follows the release of the game’s final major update back in October, amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">mass layoffs at Amazon</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crucible-review">the similarly ill-fated Crucible</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-breakaway">Breakaway</a>, New World was once a key plank of Amazon’s push to become a big mover in the games industry - amplifying its existing success as a provider of software and web services, and luring yet more innocent souls into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish">the toxic swamp</a> of the Amazon Prime subscription business. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-game-studios-announce-three-games">Announced in 2016</a>, it underwent several delays amid reports of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/report-shares-more-tales-of-disfunction-at-amazon-game-studios">corporate dysfunction in Amazon's embryonic studio empire</a>, eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazons-mmo-new-world-is-out-now-but-the-servers-are-struggling">launching out of beta in 2021</a>, with a storyline conclusion landing in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-will-get-its-storyline-conclusion-in-its-next-update">2022</a>.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-review-in-progress">mildly enthused by New World at launch</a>, calling the game “a fresh, swashbuckling MMO that's still very grindy early on”. Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-worlds-crafting-is-great-because-i-had-no-choice-but-to-use-it">liked the emphasis on crafting</a>. It had over 700,000 players on Steam on release day. But then it proceeded to <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/new-world-daily-active-players-down-more-than-90-on-steam-from-record-high-in-september-2000124162">lose over 90% of its players in a matter of months</a>.</p>
<p>I never played New World myself, mostly because I try to avoid anything associated with Amazon, but it never struck me as particularly fascinating from afar – familiar combat and quest mechanics with some convoluted magic settler politics. Still, I’m sorry for any New World developers who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this latest “sunsetting”. In general, I'll take a lacklustre MMO over Jeff Bezos's desire to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-unveils-lunar-lander-mission/story?id=62941981">move humans into giant, Amazon-run space stations</a>.</p><p>The game’s live service will continue to operate before the servers are pulled, with recurring world bosses and bonus weeks. The devs will also keep an eye out for bugs and performance issues. But there will be no more content additions or server merges. You’ll be able to buy in-game currencies such as Marks of Fortune until July 20, 2026 – beware that Amazon are not offering refunds for such purchases.</p>
<p>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” the devs <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">write on their official site</a>. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community."</p>
<p>Any New World veterans reading? I’d like to read some reminiscing.</p>

            <p>I be a poor journo. Newly come from the official Ubisoft music YouTube channel. I spend my life in jeopardy.
Of a publisher suddenly turning around and saying that a sudden mass reupload of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties was in fact just a case of behind-the-scenes issues, rather than another harbinger of a remake announcement.</p>
<p>Tp be fair, it did follow many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the Black Flag remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that sure looks like it's for such a game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-black-flag-music-reupload-was-due-to-technical-issues/">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft have popped their head above deck on their music channel's community page in the hours since they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-sea-shanty-siren-song-grows-even-more-deafening-as-ubisoft-reupload-a-bunch-of-sailing-tunes">suddenly uploaded 18 Black Flag sea shanties in a one 24 hour window</a>.</p>
<p>"Hi there music lovers," wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx_qiROkA8vcnQk_a-1BH_gW4gTLnDetS0">Ubi's instrument-wielders</a>. "We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music." It's a statement which neatly dances around mentioning Black Flag by name or getting into the specifics of why the technical gremlins affecting these specific decade or so old tracks have seemingly been discovered now of all times, with that heavily-reported remake looking very much to be on its way to port.</p>
<p>To be fair, maybe someone at Ubisoft just woke up one day really wanting to blast 17th century maritime ditties for the first time in ages and found something was getting in their way.</p>
<p>The Black Flag remake, or Resynced if the PEGI rating has its name correct, is reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to sail this March</a>. Until then, all we can do is sit on the beach and keep our telescopes trained for sails on the horizon.</p>

            <p>I think we all <em>want</em> it to be true that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>’ infamously limp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">PC performance</a> can be blamed upon, as was reported yesterday, an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-might-stand-to-be-improved-by-limiting-dlc-checks-but-thats-not-necessarily-a-silver-bullet">overzealous DLC checking process</a> gumming up what might overwise be a perfectly fine-running beastfight game. Partly because it just sounds funny. Willing but frustrated graphics elves running about, harangued to distraction by a hairstyle add-on overseer nagging for licenses, like a Daily Telegraph reader demanding to know why you aren’t wearing a poppy on November 3rd.</p>
<p>The best part? All evidence suggests it genuinely is true – albeit only to varying degrees, and in the case of my own testing, nowhere near as drastically as in the originally discovered case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">redditor de_Tylmarande</a> found that framerates around MHW’s base camp hubs more than tripled after tricking MHW into thinking he had all the game’s cosmetic DLCs – 190 in total, and costing over £460 in the King’s sterling – installed. Separately, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">a mod limiting the checks</a> was also widely found to improve performance in those hubs, especially around the desks where a DLC-hocking cat hangs out. Capcom themselves then <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">announced</a>, with suspicious timing, an upcoming patch containing performance improvements.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what happens when you legitimately do have the full cosmetic catalogue in your account, so fired up the RPS Test Rig and took some framerate recordings on a 'clean' install, free of add-ons. I then went about dropping nearly half a grand on fluffy pendants and bird outfits, by which I mean I added them all through our Steam press account at the expense of nobody in particular.</p>
<figure>

<p>Subsequent retests indicated, at best, FPS improvements that remain dependent on the hardware producing them. With the popular RTX 4060, running at 1080p/Ultra with some help from Quality DLSS, a pre-DLC average of 66fps around camp only rose to 67fps after the shopping spree. However, the much more powerful RTX 5080, at 4K/Ultra (also with DLSS Quality), got a more substantial rise of 67fps to 73fps. Still miles off a tripling, but enough to escape any likely margin of error.</p><p>Both GPUs also saw slight improvements to 0.1% framerates, which basically means their lowest framerates didn’t fall as low. Before DLC, the RTX 4060’s 0.1% value was 42fps, which climbed to 45fps afterwards. The RTX 5080’s low of 27fps also ticked up to 33fps. Since one of Monster Hunter Wilds’ biggest performance annoyances is its stuttering, even small gains like this can translate into visibly smoother running.</p>
<p>Since the bug appears location-based, worsening in severity the closer you get to that DLC vendor, I didn’t see any meaningful boosts to average framerates out in the field. As such, and in case this wasn’t apparent already, Rock Paper Shotgun Dot Com does not recommend the purchasing of nearly 200 trinkets in an attempt to make MHW go faster. Still, the base camp results do back up the theory that something is amiss; I’ll have another go after Capcom’s patch arrives on January 27th, and see if this most unusual of transactional bugs gets squished.</p>

Capcom have released a new 13 minute <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay showcase, with commentary from director Koshi Nakanishi. About 20% of it is Leon Kennedy kicking zombies in the noggin, doing Wickian dodge-shoots, or chopping torsos with a chainsaw or hatchet (the latter a subweapon that needs periodic resharpening). Another 20% consists of new, stealth-oriented character Grace creeping through ornate chambers in first person; being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-sitting-in-a-hot-sauna">"cold bath" to Leon's "hot sauna"</a>, she doesn’t have serious fighting skills, but she does have a ‘pinch hitter’ handcannon for those times when skulking behind tableware won’t cut the mustard. There’s talk of a new crafting system, whereby Grace turns zombie blood into a vaccine to stop corpses reanimating.

A solid third of the video consists of preorder collectables, GeForce Now promotion, and a much-hyped collaboration with Porsche on the design of Leon’s car. This last bit feels like two marketing teams conspiring to justify each other’s pay rises, and is about as compelling to me as putting go-faster stripes on a jar of mayonnaise. I am, however, quite intrigued by a fleeting mention that Resi 9’s garden-variety shamblers have memories. As Nakanishi puts it, “this time there are zombies that retain characteristics from when they were alive”.

We catch glimpses of this in the footage, mostly during Grace’s segments, which are more about observation. There’s a custodian who carries on cleaning the facilities, scrubbing mirrors in a frenzy. There’s a butcher with a cleaver who mechanically growls “next” to kitchen staff who have, I assume, long since been disassembled. Some of these mundane routines are tactical opportunities for Grace. There’s a zombie restlessly working a light switch, for example, creating pools of shadow for you to sneak through.
</p><p>
I don’t think this is Resident Evil seriously venturing into the realm of pathos, let alone embracing the prospect of a pacifist playthrough. Let’s not forget Leon and his hatchet. There are plenty of partly or fully sentient named undead characters in Resident Evils gone by, and I’m not sure many of them were ‘sympathetic’, exactly. Maybe you carry a candle for Wesker – good luck with that. Still, Requiem promises to make interactions with the rank-and-file infected a little more emotionally complex. Perhaps you will feel a pang now and then while you’re wiping the offal from your boots.
