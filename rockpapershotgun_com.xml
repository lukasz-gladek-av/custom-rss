            <p>If you've been waiting to bless one of your friends with an entire dump truck worth of games in a series they've enjoyed one entry of, then good news. Valve have made Steam's 'complete the set' bundles giftable, with prices adjusting to match whichever bits the recipient might already own - so you're not in danger of hurling someone their second copy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> on one storefront.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The steamywatchers over at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3mctvj67hwf27">SteamDB</a> were  the first to spot that this sort of bundle gifting's now allowed. I've given it a quick test that involved momentarily holding the nearly £120 Fallout series bundle over the heads of several Steam friends.</p>
<p>You'll be glad to hear that the price changed in relation to the games in the bundle they already owned, just as happens if you go to buy one of these bundles for your own account. For one friend, I'd be playing somewhere in the region of £87 for the bits required to totally drown them in rads, while another would set me back only £71. That is, of course still wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much to pay to make sure someone owns both Fallout Tactics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s extra fishing gear, but hey, maybe next time the sale rolls around.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a handy feature for Steam to offer. Not being able to dump all of the Yakuza/Like A Dragons on your mum at Christmas, alongside an email linking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">this article</a> ain't right. Now, to wait a full year for the opportunity to do it.</p><p>In other recent Steam-related news, Valve have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-no-longer-earn-steam-points-from-community-awards-as-valve-try-to-kill-off-clownface-farming">revamped their community award emojis</a> in an effort to stop people deliberately writing anger-inducing and clown sticker-attracting posts in order to earn Steam points they can spend on fancy profile backgrounds. I'm sure it'll work and I'll soon be able to read a discussion thread or review section without the risk of rolling my eyes so hard they plop out onto my desk.</p>

            <p>Integrity. Inteh-gritty. In-teh-grih-teh. That's the word of the day when it comes to 2026 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>, or at least it will be if the plans Jagex have just laid out work as intended. To be fair, pushing the big button that finally gets rid of those Treasure Hunter microtransactions <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thanks-to-a-massive-community-vote-jagex-are-removing-runescapes-notorious-treasure-hunter-microtransactions">folks vocally disliked</a> is a good start.</p>

<p>That's exactly what the RuneScape makers have done to kick off the opening section of the 2026 roadmap they talk through in the video above and <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-roadmap-that-changes-runescape-forever">this post</a>. The gist of what they've dubbed the game's "Road to Restoration" is that they're hoping to make sure that RuneScape's put firmly back on track and set up for a bright future as it rings its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Hence the ditching of the Treasure Hunter microtransactions, with their items set to be driven into extinction in the long-run to boot. "Over the course of 2026, players will have the opportunity to use up any existing stockpiles, with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before these items are ultimately made obsolete," Jagex wrote.</p><p>Along with Treasure's removal, the winter update which has just gone live delivers a few other bits. There's a retooled user interface designed to work back in some classic RuneScape furniture like a circular minimap and the option to toggle cosmetics like wings into an invisible form if they bother you. plus, there's been a worldspace update focusing on free-to-play locales like Lumbridge, Draynor, and Varrock.</p>
<p>Moving forward through the rest of the year, regular larger additions like the two-part Havenhythe expansion, player-owned housing, and player avatars will be packaged with more revamping of existing features. For example, spring promises a combat update that'll aim to modernise the three base fighting styles by adding the likes of a basic attack and retooling abilities which are no longer fit for purpose, while three rounds of general balancing tweaks are penned in across the year. The RuneMetrics stat-tracking system is also set to drop the Pro part of its price of entry, instead being offered to all paid RuneScape members.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like a number of steps in the right direction, albeit with the caveat of Jagex needing to do all of this re-integritising because they'd jumped so far into the integrityless microtransaction waters to start with.</p>
