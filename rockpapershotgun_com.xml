            <p>Reader, I must apologise for the intolerably wholesome nature of RPS of late. My last couple of reviews were of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">a laidback farming sim</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/routine-review">showcase of nostalgic hardware</a>. Glancing down the news feed, I note with outrage that Oisin has recently been writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/match-delightfully-silly-hand-drawn-dogs-in-dogpile-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-take-on-suika-game">Very Good Doggos</a> (being thrown into pits), while Mark has been spilling ink over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">that least offensive of politicians, Keir Starmer</a>. Time to consign Starmer, the doggos, and those fetching Macintosh-me-dos to the waste bin along with my lingering fondness for Dreamcast-era platformers. Let's cleanse our palates of sugar with a post about stinking murderous zealots. For you see, there is now a demo available for Band Of Crusaders, the new tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Polish developers Virtual Alchemy and publishers NCSoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
These aren't the crusaders your great-great-etc grandparents hopefully neither joined nor had to run away from back in the 12th century. They live in a very Witchery France that is being consumed from within by many-armed abominations, towering arch-demons, sigil-ridden cultists and... bandits. 
</p>
<p>
I did get a chuckle out of <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kxu4xg5fx3gi6dwjlgfws5hw/bafkreianzgimybybt7reciurxievyfirm3ltldyada3hpnlelzobqirty4@jpeg">this image</a>'s casual equivocation of the likes of Beelzebub with ordinary human thieves. We all remember that line from Revelations, right? "And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. Also there were some guys in hoods who stole my favourite cow. The crowned beast I can live with tbh, but I'm in the cheesemaking trade and I really needed that cow."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. You stroll around a real-time overworld in tabletop figurine form, steadily consuming resources and periodically entering your campsite to re-equip your hairy devil-dingers, level them up, and send them off to the infirmary as needed. There are quests with fairly extravagant historical fantasy writing. These take you between cities with trading facilities and a range of smaller locations, such as monasteries. While sallying forth to the latter, you will likely encounter another, opposing figurine, plunging you into a separately loading smaller real-time battlefield, where men in metal hats bellow and belabour each other with clubs and greatswords. Or sickles and pitchforks if that's all you can afford.
</p>

<p>
Thing I like: the impression of a world steadily succumbing to a demon blight. Cities have cult activity bars; I imagine you'll have a hard time buying more grain and furnace parts if the major hubs are totally overrun. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">Kingdoms mode in Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, with your party striving to prop up farflung settlements. Thing I'm indifferent on: the real-time combat seems fine, with much seemingly depending on choice of weapon: a sword won't bust up plate armour like a hammer. The weapon categories accompany a pinwheel of unlockables that skew towards roles such as tanking, DPS, etcetera. It's sturdy enough, but nothing mindblowing.
</p><p>
Things I dislike: the repetitive combat barks and the fact that all the French-accented English voice staff sound like hastily recruited exchange students. Also, I don't get the sense that this is particularly mindful of the mayhem associated with real-life Crusades; based on 30 minutes, anyway, it seems pretty free and lemon-squeezy with the "deus vult" stuff that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">has proven popular among the latter-day alt-righteous</a>. The choice of otherworldly opponents can naturally be read as dodging the association with religious pogroms and persecution.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because I could really go for a horror tactics game that investigates the ugliness of the crusader worldview, and/or leans into the garishness a la Red Hook's work. Perhaps that's where the full version of Band Of Crusaders will take us? It's not impossible. I'm not sure all of my Brothers in Fiend-Bashing are the saintly sort. My hooded advisor gives off a certain brimstone vibe. I don't like the way he looks at my cows. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526570/Band_of_Crusaders/">Steam</a>.

            <p>Publishers and studios who want to show off their games during the main show at a Keighleyfest usually have to pay a not small chunk of change for the privilege. According to a fresh report from Kotaku which aims to deliver the latest figures for a couple of different trailer lengths at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a>, those handing over the cash are now looking at paying seven figures for a three-minute showing of their game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">Kotaku</a> cite two sources familiar with 2025's edition of the winter Geoffs who say that three minute trailers at this year's show go for over $1 million. Saving two minutes off that time and going for a 60-second trailer instead can reportedly still set you back up to $450,000.</p>
<p>To compare these against previous rates, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a> wrote in June 2024 that trailer prices for the main show of that year's Summer Game Fest were as follows: $250,000 for a minute, $350,000 for a minute and 30 seconds, $450,000 for two minutes, and $550,000 for two and a half minutes. 2023's summer Geoffs were reported to have run the same pricing tiers.</p>
<p>So, having a presence at the front and centre of these sorts of showcases often remains costly. Though, <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku</a> did report having heard from that certain smaller game makers may get free airtime. These are called "earned editorial placements". They're not just for the little guys - Kotaku suggest that big reveals from major publishers like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft may also qualify. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-costs-of-exhibiting-at-a-video-game-convention-1">As ever with shows like these</a>, companies may also pay to run a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Kotaku's latest piece outlines the costs a nominated developer can face simply getting devs to the show, if they wish to bring more than the two people who're reportedly offered complimentary attendance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> devs Sandfall Interactive have paid for a number of extra tickets at around $300 each this year, it's claimed. Meanwhile, a freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year, but is no longer under contract with the studio, expressed frustration at the Geoffs' organisers only selling general admission tickets after announcement of the nominations, while apparently neglecting to keep any reserved for developers who can prove they worked on nominated games.</p><p>These sorts of stories continue to fuel debate as to whether the Geoffs do a good enough job of celebrating developers and acknowledging the serious issues an industry decimated by layoffs faces, alongside all of the advertising. Just yesterday, the United Videogame Workers-CWA union hosted their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3m7olyr5u2k2w">inaugural "avarice awards"</a> on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/UVW_CWA">Twitch</a>, a protest parody of the Game Awards which dished out plaudits like "Most Corporate Speak/Tactless Layoff Announcement", "Worst Crunch Culture", and "Most Studios Closed". Tencent and Microsoft tied for first place in that last one.</p>
<p>The latest edition of the winter Geoffs kick off later today, and we'll have plenty of words to deliver to you about the things that're announced.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a> 2 launched from early access in September 2024, its premium edition and content pass promised something no other game in the series had delivered: a singleplayer campaign.</p>
<p>The Times of War DLC would for the first time give you an authored story and set of missions for each faction. Originally announced for release in "Fall 2025", there are players of the series who have waited nearly 20 years for this, and they're still waiting because there's no sign of the DLC yet. Nor Harbinger, the expansion bringing a fourth playable race to Sins of a Solar Empire 2.</p>
<p>"They're definitely still on the road map," development lead Brian Clair tells me, "but we've shifted them around a bit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Clair and I spoke ahead of Sins of a Solar Empire 2's 1.5 update, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2s-ai-will-now-only-hate-you-if-you-give-it-a-good-reason">overhauls the AI of NPC factions and adds a suite of diplomacy tools</a>. However, it doesn't bring Harbinger or Times of War. "They're both high up on the road map," Clair says. "We've promised this stuff to people who bought the premium edition with the content pass, so we have a duty to deliver."</p><p>The team had "originally planned to do the campaign first," Clair explains, but Stardock will instead work on Harbinger next. "The reason for that is we want to have the fourth faction in the campaign, and it would be really hard to have them in the campaign before we actually had the assets made," Clair says. "It just made logical sense to swap it." Clair says Harbinger is set for release in late 2026, with Times of War now due in 2027.</p>
<p>That's a hefty delay and one that leaves players who have paid money for a DLC potentially waiting three years for its release. Though, signs of Stardock's progress toward the campaign are trickling down into Sins 2. In the Paths to Power DLC, released in March this year, Stardock added scenarios. These mission-driven maps gave players objectives and special victory conditions, something that hadn't appeared in any previous game in the series. "That was actually the foundation for the campaign," Clair says. "We're going to need to use all those systems to make the campaign happen."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Stardock Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While that may be the first step in building a campaign, there is still a long way to go. Even now, adding a new scenario is a fiddly business. "You fire up VS code, and you're hand writing out the JSON to bring this together," Clair says. "As a developer, I can do it, but it's really going to slow it down." It's much worse for modders. Next year, along with the push to complete Harbinger, Stardock plans "to build a tool to streamline [scenario creation] and not just for us, but so modders can use it too."</p><p>Then, with Times of War, Stardock wants to share the tools it makes to build its campaign, so modders can tell more complex stories than those possible in single scenarios. "What they're going to be getting when we tackle the campaign in full is the ability to bring all those together into a coherent whole and add in more to it, cinematics, custom victory conditions depending on your story path, that kind of thing," Clair says.</p>
<p>Sins has an active modding scene, twisting its real-time space operas into different shapes. Some original, some, er, <a href="https://mod.io/g/sins2/m/sta4-core#description">more Star Trek adjacent</a>. So, while such a long delay is frustrating, the prospect of modders getting their hands on the tools to create their own campaigns alongside all their current tools is an exciting one. Now if only someone were to mod in a Tribble faction, then I could allow my excitement to reach fever pitch.</p>
