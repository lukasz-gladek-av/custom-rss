            <p>
I hope none of you are allergic to shellfish, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shrimp-game">Shrimp Game</a> is exactly what it sounds like: a game about shrimp! And yet that is a complete bastardisation of what it is, for you do not simply play as a shrimp, you are piloting a shrimp, or SHRIMP (Submersible Hydrodynamic Research Integrated Marine Platforms), and you must survive a hellish underwater landscape filled with sea creatures that strive to see your life ended and "Lovecraftian bosses."
</p>
<p>
There is a hint of games like Armored Core to be found here, more so in movement mechanics. You don't pick out parts for your shrimp, but you do pilot it as if it were a mech, zooming around the seascape, shooting at other fishes and the like with your abilities. These abilities are based on elements like fire and earth, or light and dark, and you can even mix and match them to a certain degree. You will also find, amazingly, that you can play the game's campaign in six-player co-op, or you can try out its PvP modes like "Shrimp Royale, Shrimp Tag, and Capture the Turtle!"
</p>
<p>
Shrimp Game currently has a demo on Steam that I spent a bit of time with after spotting it in The Virtual Moose's most recent <a href="https://virtualmoose.org/2025/11/08/indie-game-roundup-november-8-2025/">indie game round-up</a> - just in the campaign mode, though its online mode is available too - and it is as frenetic as it is wacky. Enemy attacks approach you at all angles, you need to be constantly aware of your surroundings otherwise you'll end up sleeping with the fishes, literally and figuratively.
</p>
<p>
Its world is tantalizingly weird and mysterious too, as silly as it might be to feel this way about something called Shrimp Game, I really vibed with its salty hellscape. I want to learn about why this world exists in the way it does. I want to understand why I have to pilot the shrimp.
</p>
<p>
When can I do this? Well, sometime in 2026, as it doesn't have a more specific release date beyond that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824880/SHRIMP_GAME/">wishlist the game on Steam</a> (and try out the demo) right now.

Do you think there are people out there that feel as passionately as sports fans do when someone gets added to their team that might make them better, but with video game developers? Probably not, or at least only on a personal level, but for that hypothetical group of people that exists, a new trade (is that how you refer to sports doers, I really don't know) has taken place between the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and CD Projekt Red.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced on his personal Bwitter account earlier today that "<a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342">Things are happening!</a>" those things being that he now works for CD Projekt Red as a senior quest designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-loss-is-the-witcher-4s-gain-as-cd-projekt-red-picks-up-the-lead-gameplay-designer-behind-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-action-rpg/">GamesRadar</a>). While I can't tell you the exact missions Kolmann worked on in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a handy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolmann/overlay/1738234374263/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAA-hQ1MBs2pvuw9SYLFGUiET729k6q5A4Fw">LinkedIn post</a> tells us that he designed and wrote 11 of them, and also designed the game's crime system alongside the stealth and perception systems of NPCs.
</p>
<p>
A clue into the kind of work he might be doing on The Witcher 4? Literally no way of knowing! But he does have some specific skills, so Ciri getting up to some stealthy stuff feels possible at least.
</p>
<p>
As it currently stands, we… don't actually know all that much about The Witcher 4. Here's some things we do know: it's "more console-first" though it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-console-first-development-still-push-pcs">still be able to melt your PC</a>, it'll be made in Unreal Engine 5 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">even got a fancy tech demo</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't be out before 2027</a>, and will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">apparently explore sexism more directly</a> with Ciri at the helm. Considering it only properly started development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">at the end of last year</a>, we're probably a ways out from getting any kind of gameplay trailer. I'm sure you can just play The Witcher 4 for the umpteenth time while you wait.
