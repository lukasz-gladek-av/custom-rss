Ah, live service games. You put out a new feature, everybody complains about one thing or another, you say something like "we've heard your feedback" and change it the next time around. This, almost word for word, is exactly what's happened with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' and its impending second Expedition, the details of which have been outlined in a handy blog post from developer Embark.
</p>
<p>
Expeditions, for the uninitiated, is essentially the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> take on prestiging, essentially resetting yourself back to the beginning, with a few bonuses to make that reset less of a full-on one. That feedback that Embark have heard is related to how much it costs to set off on an Expedition. Those that chose to go through with the first Expedition needed five million coins from their stash value in order to do it, but now all you'll need is three million, and you'll still get five skill points as your reward.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, those that couldn't scrounge up the moolah to Expedition the first time around, there'll be a skill point catch up system allowing you to reclaim any you missed. "The catch up Skill Points will be heavily discounted, making the total Coins needed to reach max Skill Points less for each Expedition," the aforementioned <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">blog post</a> explains. "Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your Skill Points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time."
</p>
<p>
Those going on their first Expedition will also get the Patchwork outfit, while those on their second will get an evolved version of it with four additional toggles and colour options. Your stash spaces will also increase up to 24, and you can get up to five skill points. All of that is permanent, while some of the consecutive buffs include a 10% XP boost, a 12% scrappy materials boost, and a 70% repair value increase. Whether any of this is worth it or not still, that's up to you, but at least it's a bit cheaper now! Oh, and you'll be able to sign up to this expedition from February 25th, and will kick off March 1st. Happy Arc Raiding!
