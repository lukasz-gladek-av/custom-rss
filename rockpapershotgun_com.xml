            <p>The only sound that greets you upon booting up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eclipsium">Eclipsium</a> is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the<em> real</em> game here was it trying to freak me out. "It’s fine", I decided. "It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. "If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon."</p>
<p>So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/">demo if you’re curious</a> and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.</p>

<p>The first thing I really honed in on with Eclipsium is its use of the first person perspective, and specifically the hands. Your right hand is permanently held out, palm facing forward, as if to clamber through darkness or prepare to bop a potentially aggressive dog on the nose with the heel. Your fingers move slightly as you look about, and there’s an extra layer of unnerving presence in the hand posture being very similar to the one I use for my ergonomic mouse. One idle animation has you briefly flex it into the claw. It all contributes one of the most effective and unique horror game tricks I’ve seen in a hot minute. There’s an utter vulnerability to at once being reminded your character has a physical body, and is also completely lacking a shotgun.</p><p>You start the game in a cabin, and as you explore, your hand will automatically stretch out at interactable objects. A globe. The shrieking plant. A key. The cabin is lit warmly in warped orange hues, and utterly depressing classical music plays. I unlock the door, step out into the woods, and turn around to ascertain the dimensions of the cabin. It is now dark, the music has stopped, and all the furnishings are gone. You’re trying to horror me up, aren’t you, Eclipsium? You’re trying to rustle my shirt buttons, and it’s absolutely working.</p>

<p>The midnight woods are lit by a bright red blood sky, and I get lost quite quickly, finding a strange mushroom in the woods that makes my vision go even more fuzzy than it already was. As is customary, I stare at my hands for a bit until the effects fade. The woods eventually offer up their greatest bounty: an axe, which I use to chop down a tree to make a bridge across a ravine. This breaks the axe. As I cross the tree, I think back to all the good times I had with the axe. A truly wonderful four seconds, it was. Now I am axe-less, and the woods are very threatening.</p>
<p>I will not tell what lay in the cave I found at the end of that path, but I will say that Eclipsium’s atmosphere is so thick and frightening you could cut it with, well, a deceptively sturdy axe. Here are some solid oak Steam facts:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Explore over a dozen vivid and surreal environments</li>
<li>Multiple carefully crafted full-motion video cutscenes</li>
<li>Intuitive and atmospheric puzzles</li>
<li>Painstakingly created hand animations</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>They did not lie about the hand animations, I’ll tell you that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up <a href="https://wintesm.tumblr.com/post/120149267193/an-old-2013-ish-hexafusion-of-vivi-from-final">this lovely bit of art</a> featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2819920/OOLO/">this link</a> to it’s free demo.</p>
<p>(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound <em>better</em>.)</p>

<p>Oolo is, I gather, the name of your purple wizard. The Steam page promises a sort of homage to isometric adventures of yore, and this moony yore-gazing is immediately apparent in a couple of nice ways. Firstly, the goal of the demo is to find a glowy green trinket named the ‘earth key’. Love that. Love not needing to worry about absent love ones or societal threats and just setting out to find a bloody lovely shiny key.</p>

<p>The second is the music, starting with a few plaintive key plucks before growing into some rushy, synthy brass that evokes two dudes with opposite vocal ranges shouting the word ‘adventure!’ at you really fast in either ear, layered over with some hobbity strings. Adventure it is!</p><p>The music gets ever lovelier as you start to explore, ambling your way through one isometric room at a time. You hop around, with a deeply satisfying thud when you fall off high ledges, and solve a few jumping puzzles. These feel a little tricky with the viewpoint, but the game lets you tilt rooms and switch between movement control schemes for precision. Soon, you collect a pair of gauntlets that let you push blocks. It’s all very classic Zelda in its flourishes, with hints of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> through the multiple paths and ever-expanding map.</p>
<p>I manage to die after falling on to some spikes after a bit, upon which the game informs me that “the world flame” has burnt out. Nothing’s ever simple is it? I knew it couldn’t just be a key! Still, world-saving labour or not, I’m quite smitten by Oolo, which is clearly a labour of love. Here are some touted features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Explore a vast world with over 400 interconnected rooms!</li>
<li>Venture through dark forests, subterranean crypts, deadly swamps, and more.</li>
<li>Find new artifacts that change the way you move and interact with the world.</li>
<li>Move blocks, ride enemies, and jump your way to exciting new areas.</li>
<li>Non-violent fun for the entire family!</li>
<li>Scour the land for the six elemental keys that will unlock the portal to the World Flame.</li>
<li>Secret areas and hidden powers await the heartiest adventurers.</li>
<li>Discover memories of keepers who rekindled the flame in generations past to give you hints for your journey!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would argue that Oolo falling on those spikes <em>suggests</em> violence, but only if you think about too hard. Otherwise, a fine entry in the pantheon of yellow-eyed conjurers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
