Reburn's posh-looking near-future shooter La Quimera now has a release date - April 25th 2025. Which is mighty soon for an FPS project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">we first heard about this very February</a>, though nothing to be alarmed by - it's been in development since around 2020.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Reburn are a rebrand of Metro studio 4A Games Ukraine - they're not to be confused with 4A Games in Malta, who are still working on the Metro series. La Quimera doesn't look much like Metro. I compared it to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in our announcement post, and the below trailer's worth of exosuit punching and heatvision railgunnery is doing nothing to dissipate that characterisation.

La Quimera is set "in and around the fictional Latin American mega-city of Nuevo Caracas". You and up to two of your friends play members of a PMC group "caught up in a vast conflict between rival factions and shadowy corporations, as mystical events increasingly blur the line between reality and illusion". (OK, the last part is perhaps more Black Ops 3 than Advanced Warfare.)</p>
<p>Care of a mysterious benefactor, you've got a slick mecha-onesie with the power to go invisible, and a bunch of guns that look like mating stealth bombers. The game's world and narrative feature writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn - who, now that I think of it, has also contributed his likeness to Hideo Kojima's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games. One suspects that Refn might be trying to Do A Vin Diesel and reinvent himself as a video game guy.
</p>

Reburn remain based in Kyiv, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-air-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2025-04-06/">struck just today by Russian missiles</a> in the course of Russia's three-year-old assault on its smaller neighbour. "As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry," CEO Dmytro Lymar comments in a statement.

If you'd like to try those exosuits on for size, the developers are running a closed 24 hour Steam beta for La Quimera, starting April 12th at 7am PT, 3pm BST or 4pm CEST. It'll support co-op. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam</a>.
