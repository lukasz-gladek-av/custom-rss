            <p>
There is perhaps no better setting than some woods or a forest that just sucks ass. Just a confusing, scary, maybe sometimes enchanting mess of nature that is impossible to navigate. Today's latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> just so happens to present such a visage, with towering, beautiful trees, and yet again a wonderful sense of scale.
</p>
<p>
This new update is, appropriately, called Roots! I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the meaning there. Aside from the big old trees, there's also new nasties like spiders and giant beetles that will ruin your pilgrimage to the top, and, by the looks of the update's trailer, a fungal zombie infection that takes over your compatriots' bodies. Genuinely conceptually horrifying stuff for a game so cutesy. I like it!

<p>
The Roots biome comes with 11 new badges to earn too, and some biome-specific items too, like Shroomberries that have random effects, a couple of types of fungi, and some other, secret items. There's also some new items to be found across all biomes, like the rescue claw (does what it says on the tin), the checkpoint flag (does what it says on the tin), and the Book of Bones (does what it says on the tin?).
</p><p>
You'll also find that cooking has been overhauled. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/809085268448511599?l=english">Steam post</a> about the update, "a lot more non-food items will now Actually Do Something when cooked," for one. Once cooked poisonous berries will be safe to eat, whereas poisonous mushrooms won't be. And cooked "usable but non-food items such as bandages will no longer grant Extra Stamina."
</p>
<p>
There are a few bug fixes too, and apparently the divorce court has permitted Bing Bong to visit his kids on weekends, which is a strange sentence to have written as a part of my job, but hey ho, I've got bills to pay. The Roots update is available right now, so have at ye.

            <p>
Throughout my time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, I mostly didn't actually miss the first game's not-so-titular Knight. I do love that bug, it's just Hornet made for quite a compelling protagonist (even if I think that the game has a number of issues that go further than just it being potentially unfairly hard). I doubt this will be a universal feeling however, which is where this handy mod where you can once again play as the Knight, but in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, comes into play.
</p>
<p>
The mod, which was originally shared on Github by user <a href="https://github.com/MCXGK3/KnightInSilkSong">MCXGK3</a>, but made available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/745">Nexus Mods</a> if that's your modhub of choice, does what it says on the tin frankly! The description is equally simple: "This is a Mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong. It allows you to control the knight in the game." What else could you possibly need to know? 
</p>
<p>
Well, it's not just an aesthetic change. The mod also brings back the Knight's entire moveset, and you can even equip it with the original game's various charms. It seems quite comprehensive honestly, just keep in mind that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> was not designed around the Knight's playstyle, so that might act as a hindrance.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the mod does have "some things" that can prevent you from getting to Act 3, "or even completing the game," so do take that into consideration too. There's also some bugs - like, the kind that make the game run bad, not the ones you'll be befriending or killing - meaning this mod might be one you want to miss if you want a smooth experience, or if you're playing for the first time. Still sounds better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">all those horny Hornet mods</a>.
