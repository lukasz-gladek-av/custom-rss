I like playing a game where I get to defend myself from/ take down the likes of ghouls, ghosts, demons and other such and much paranormal, supernatural beasties, but how about a game where you're the one doing the haunting? Ghost Keeper! Is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, puzzley game where you "lead your fearsome minions against the living" by attempting to scare them off, and just launched in early access today.
</p>
<p>
On the offset, Ghost Keeper almost looks like a Sims expansion, or perhaps incredibly dedicated mod, what with its top down view, exaggerated character animations, and semi-real but still kind of goofy in a fun way vibe. Taking place in a Victorian setting, with six locations to choose from as part of this early access launch, you control the likes of ghosts and various monsters, with the express goal of scaring off a group of humans called the Brotherhood who appear to be legally distinct Ghostbusters.

This might include some spectral floating plates, luring people in with a cute demonic kitty, or just giving them a tap on the shoulder to freak 'em out. Interestingly, the game is actually a story-driven one, though the early access release only offers a part of that right now. Upon beating what's currently available you do get access to a sandbox mode to play around with, though!
</p><p>
According to the game's Steam page, the plan is for it to be in early access for about a year, but right now a majority of the mechanics are already available. There are also plans for more creatures, abilities, areas and more in future updates. Also worth noting that as more updates roll out, the price will be gradually increased, so perhaps it's worth getting on the ground floor now if you're interested. You can check out, or wishlist, the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">here</a>.

            <p>An Assassin's Creed level designer has claimed that Ubisoft have put him on unpaid disciplinary leave for speaking out publicly against the company’s recently introduced requirement that staff return to the office full-time.</p>
<p>The level designer in question is David Michaud-Cromp, team lead for level design on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> (which is cited on his LinkedIn with its older “Codename Red” working title). He started at Ubisoft Montreal in 2012, working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, and also has credits on the best-selling Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>.</p>
<p>The backstory: last week, Ubisoft announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelling a load of games</a> and laying off staff in the course of transforming themselves into the New Hotness with funding from Tencent. They also announced that they would no longer allow hybrid or remote working, with staff receiving a yearly allowance of work from home days, instead. An executive commented that “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.” Unionised Ubisoft developers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">not convinced</a>.</p>
<p>Michaud-Cromp offered his own thoughts on the RTO policy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420149620619509761/">a LinkedIn post from 23rd January</a>. "Last week, So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they "believe in collaboration"... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…" he wrote.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D6Tml2ZTCo">a Youtube video</a> from Damon Cassidy, which argues that RTO policies are better understood as “a way to maintain oversight and reinforce traditional hierarchies”, while propping up office real estate prices.</p>
<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, Ubisoft haven’t reacted well to his taking a public stance on RTO, though I’m not sure which specific comments he’s referring to. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-share-7422041590346661889-7e3C/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">a LinkedIn post from yesterday</a>, he writes that: “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty,” the post continues.</p>
<p>“I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>I’ve asked Ubisoft for a statement. I've seen a couple other Ubisoft developers speaking up about the RTO policy and wider cutbacks - in the circumstances, it's probably best not to name them. In other news, Ubisoft are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposing up to 200 layoffs</a> at Ubisoft Paris, even as unionised workers ready themselves for another strike.</p>
