            <p>Microsoft have cancelled their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot and closed its development studio The Initiative in the course of this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">scything sacrifices to their actually rather healthy bottom line</a>. In a statement, head of Xbox Matt Booty also confirmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">the cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>, alongside "several unannounced projects". </p> <!--more-->
<p>Booty says this "reflects a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape." For context, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">announced net income of $25.8 billion</a> for their most recent financial quarter, with the Xbox division also posting year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>In an email to staff announcing the wider layoffs, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer echoed Booty in styling them a question of "[making] choices now for continued success in future years", and having "the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities." A reported 9,100 people have been kicked to the curb across Microsoft's operations, but as far as I know, no senior leadership salaries are being "disciplined".</p>
<p>While depressing, the cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> perhaps isn't surprising, given how long it had been in development, and Rare's reported difficulties settling on a direction for the game. The Perfect Dark reboot was also a troubled project. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-making-a-new-perfect-dark">Announced in 2020</a>, it was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-in-early-development-and-years-from-release-report-claims">"in the earliest stages"</a> of development in 2023, according to one report. But then came a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">June 2024 trailer</a> that brought a smile even to Graham Smith's careworn visage. I thought it seemed promising, too, albeit not much like the campy original for N64.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all those affected, and to all those who don't yet know whether they're affected. In other layoff news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">taken the axe to a new MMO from Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios</a>. There are probably more cancellations to be announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success]]></content:encoded>
