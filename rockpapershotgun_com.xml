            <p>Integrity. Inteh-gritty. In-teh-grih-teh. That's the word of the day when it comes to 2026 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>, or at least it will be if the plans Jagex have just laid out work as intended. To be fair, pushing the big button that finally gets rid of those Treasure Hunter microtransactions <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thanks-to-a-massive-community-vote-jagex-are-removing-runescapes-notorious-treasure-hunter-microtransactions">folks vocally disliked</a> is a good start.</p>

<p>That's exactly what the RuneScape makers have done to kick off the opening section of the 2026 roadmap they talk through in the video above and <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-roadmap-that-changes-runescape-forever">this post</a>. The gist of what they've dubbed the game's "Road to Restoration" is that they're hoping to make sure that RuneScape's put firmly back on track and set up for a bright future as it rings its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Hence the ditching of the Treasure Hunter microtransactions, with their items set to be driven into extinction in the long-run to boot. "Over the course of 2026, players will have the opportunity to use up any existing stockpiles, with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before these items are ultimately made obsolete," Jagex wrote.</p><p>Along with Treasure's removal, the winter update which has just gone live delivers a few other bits. There's a retooled user interface designed to work back in some classic RuneScape furniture like a circular minimap and the option to toggle cosmetics like wings into an invisible form if they bother you. plus, there's been a worldspace update focusing on free-to-play locales like Lumbridge, Draynor, and Varrock.</p>
<p>Moving forward through the rest of the year, regular larger additions like the two-part Havenhythe expansion, player-owned housing, and player avatars will be packaged with more revamping of existing features. For example, spring promises a combat update that'll aim to modernise the three base fighting styles by adding the likes of a basic attack and retooling abilities which are no longer fit for purpose, while three rounds of general balancing tweaks are penned in across the year. The RuneMetrics stat-tracking system is also set to drop the Pro part of its price of entry, instead being offered to all paid RuneScape members.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like a number of steps in the right direction, albeit with the caveat of Jagex needing to do all of this re-integritising because they'd jumped so far into the integrityless microtransaction waters to start with.</p>

            <p>The winter abates, the days begin to lengthen, the snowdrops creep forth from their burrows, and the raiders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> carry on raiding Arcs. Developers Embark have also done another round of interviews, in which they discuss plans for ARC Raiders updates in 2026, and in particular, address the question of whether to implement a player-trading menu and/or some kind of auction house feature. Right now, you can only officially barter with NPC merchants. 
</p>
<p>Briefly, the developers are concerned that such features would sabotage how players themselves organically assign value and significance to particular items. They worry it would encourage us to see everything as currency – an argument that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">echoes thoughts to RPS</a> from the launch period last year. They’re keen to maintain the enchantment of encountering another wanderer in the waste, and trading items by dropping them on the floor. They sort of don’t want it to feel too much like an “extraction” game, in effect. Ideally, all of that stuff needs to happen in the world itself.
</p>
<p>"We're not building an auction house or anything like that,” design lead Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-had-an-auction-house-style-trade-system-at-one-point-but-embark-removed-it-because-it-ruined-loot-it-turned-the-game-into-just-being-about-coins/">Gamesradar</a> in an interview. “Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.”
</p>
<p>As an example of this “social facilitation”, the devs are looking at letting you actually hold out an object to another player, rather than chucking it at their feet (and daring them to let their guard down a fraction while they push the button to pick it up).
</p><p>Watkins had more to say on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/2026-plans-embark-interview">PCGamesN</a>, describing player-trading as a “very tricky aspect” of games like ARC. "You can see it in other games that have like a more traditional auction house, especially once [in-game] currency becomes involved, I think we [would] diminish one of the central aspects of our game, which is caring about the items you find and what [their] use cases are,” he said, “rather than it being: 'I'm going to go into the world to maximize profit, take all that money out, and then just buy the things I need.'
</p>
<p>"I think any avenue we go down in terms of player trading has to keep that in mind," Watkins went on. "It can't undercut what one of the primary loops of the game is, which is caring about exploring the world, finding the things you need to find, and then caring about getting those things out, rather than, you know, hoarding 3,000 Lance's Mixtapes to sell so you can then buy all your guns on the trading market."
</p>
<p>Watkins does feel that Embark can do a lot more with the current NPC trading system, which obviously allows the developers to maintain direct control over the game’s economy. And if auction houses are off the menu, it’s very possible Embark will expand the off-map side of the game by turning the secret human citadel of Speranza into an actual walkable hub area. 
</p>
<p>"For me, personally, I love the vibe and aesthetic of a walkable hub, but I would want to preserve the menuing so that you can do it quickly and efficiently, rather than [having to] run to Celeste and then run to my [raider's room], and then 'Oops, I forgot this thing at Shani’,” Watkins told PCGamesN. “But there's also, of course, an immersion factor to that. So yeah, it's something we have discussed, and we'll continue to discuss, and I think there's definitely a good appetite on the team for it as well. It's more about when the right moment to open that door is."</p><p>All this aside, Embark are looking at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raider-devs-want-future-expeditions-to-be-less-about-fat-stacks-and-fomo">creating more varied ARC Raiders expeditions in future</a>. I quite like the idea of a proper trading animation, though I do worry about the possibility of an accompanying sucker punch mechanic. Sike! Perhaps if they foster enough bonhomie at the level of the animations, players could host their own impromptu auctions out in the wilderness.</p>
