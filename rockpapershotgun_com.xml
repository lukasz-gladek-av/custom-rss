            <p>Toys! Small toys shaped like things I know from videogames! With rules so I can make them fight each other! Again!  <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">The Witcher: No Man's Land</a> is a miniatures skirmish game set (I assume since Letho is still palling around with Nilfgaard) somewhere around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings</a>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">starter set</a> out later this year with Geralt, Letho, a Griffin, a Striga, and some mates. It uses some of the same models from Cyberpunk publisher R. Talsarion's Witcher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, so you can <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/collections/witcher">peruse or pick up a few of these already</a>. I would recommend waiting if you're tempted, though. Starter sets generally come with a chunky discount over buying models individually, and you'll get the extra bits like cards that you need to play the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For the blissfully uninitiated, skirmish games are effectively very small tabletop wargames. You only need a handful of models instead of dozens, and this focus usually means that the rules are more characterful and snappy. Personal faves include <a href="https://ttcombat.com/collections/carnevale">Carnevale</a> (Lovecraftian Venice with drunk Pulcinellas riding ostriches) and <a href="https://shop.moonstonethegame.com/">Moonstone</a> (Brian Froud-ian folklore weirdos and fairyfolk).</p>
<p>On the subject of snappiness, The Witcher: No Man's Land has one of my favourite miniature games rules, namely counterattacks. If you've ever had fun with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, know that the 40K tabletop equivalent here is waiting for whoever rolled the highest number to shoot at you for 45 minutes before you get to do anything (I'm simplifying, but that's the gist). In No Man's Land, you've got a reaction system where you can counter wounds your opponent inflicts with your own attacks and abilities, or just run off.</p>

<p>I also just really like these models, especially that elfy alchemist. Lotsa character. Slightly goofy and exaggerated. but not too much.</p>
<p>It also sounds like there's both co-op and PvPvE options with the monsters, which feels nicely thematic. The game controls the creatures, so you might get a rampaging griffon interrupting your duels, things like that. No exact release date or price on this yet, but you can sign up on the website to stay up to date. Monster Fight Club also make some Cyberpunk skirmishers that reviewed quite well. I'm oddly charmed by <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/products/combat-zone">the miniature Arasaka crate in this one</a>, for some reason.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ease-the-witcher-4-wait-with-tiny-plastic-geralt-in-a-new-skirmish-miniatures-game]]></content:encoded>
