            <p>Sponge away the dross and ephemera of my life and you're left with a series of moments in which I wonder: is <em>now</em> the right time to get into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-heroes">Legend of Heroes</a>? I've been planning to play Nihon Falcom's 17-part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series ever since a respected peer gently suggested that my enthusiasm for Final Fantasy and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> marked me out as a Basic Bitch, and that if I ever want to experience a <em>real</em> role-playing game, I should give LoH a go.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I am held back by a number of things: 1) the Legend Of Heroes games are mega-normous, possibly 2) because they're meandering and overstuffed, for all their quality, and 3) nobody I've spoken to can agree on which I should start with. I did have a breakthrough recently, coming to the conclusion that I should get the ball rolling with The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, the sixth game from 2004 - it's the one I see most often in GOAT threads, and the first in a distinct subseries. But now Nihon Falcom have ruined everything by plotting to remake it. Titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</a>, the remake will launch on 19th September (as revealed in Famitsu, via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19">Gematsu</a>). Here's the most recent trailer.

<p>
If you're familiar with Trails In The Sky, the key differences here are: new HD visuals, new voiceovers, and "the choice of traditional turn-based combat or all-new, real-time action combat", as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/">the Steam page</a>. Great: not only do I now have to decide whether to play the original game or the remake first, I also now have to pick between old and new flavours of battling. Why do you vex me, Nihon Falcom.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I consistently hear about the Trails games is that the NPC and world writing are absolutely excellent: generous to the point of exhausting, with every NPC worth returning to. If you've played it, please do not leave a comment expounding upon these or any other virtues. It will only add to my choice paralysis. I've read that anger freezes into depression if left unexpressed. Is there a point where FOMO metamorphs into a full-on midlife crisis?

            <p>
One of the programmers behind the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> has praised Rockstar for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gets-a-second-trailer-but-theres-still-no-date-for-a-pc-version">delaying </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s initial release to May next year, observing (not in so many words) that the developers could have rushed out an early release consisting of a city's worth of T-posing NPCs and whitebox freeways, and people would still have paid top dollar for the game. 
</p>

<p>
Posting on social media, DMA Design founder (and former Lemmings developer) Mike Dailly also suggested that the Miami-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s latest trailer is a bump in animation quality over the announcement video from 2023. I know, I know: video game looks better as it gets closer to release - more at eleven. Still, I have a certain amount of nerdy interest in how, exactly, GTA 6's animations may have come along.</p>
<p>Let's rattle through those trailers again. Here's the one from 2023.
</p>

<p>
Dailly had this to say on <a href="https://x.com/mdf200/status/1731946221030252614">Xitter</a> of the announcement trailer. "Looks pretty, but the animations...bloody hell guys. Can't you animate things properly? No one moves like that!" Ooft, paging the burn ward! Flash forward to this month, and Dailly's open-ended concerns appear to have been addressed by the second trailer, below. 
</p>

<a aria-label="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
"Now that's more like it," Dailly wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj2dmckgs2v">Bluesky</a> yesterday. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better... Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it."
</p>
<p>
I am not a computer wizard equipped to conjure sweaty screenfuls of buttock from the sexless insides of a PS5 using the power of maths, but I'll be honest, I don't see an enormous gulf between trailers, beyond the differing presentation and music choice.</p>
<p>Well, I think the bit in the first one where Lucia waves her arms around while standing up in the roofless car looks a bit... impressionistic, like she's trying to conduct an invisible orchestra. But come now, Mike, I don't think it's fair to body-shame an ex-con fresh out of jail because she looks a bit unsteady while sticking her arms out of a moving vehicle. She's trying to blow off some steam, Mike! Besides, perhaps there <em>is</em> an invisible orchestra in the game.</p>
<p>Here are some other arbitrary micro-comparisons: Trailer 1 has flappier bottoms. Trailer 2 has more impetuous playful shoving. Trailer 1 has more heartfelt soul brother handshakes. Trailer 2 has... no crocodiles. Perhaps that crocodile walk cycle can serve as a critical yardstick once GTA 6 releases on console next year (PC release date, as ever, to follow). In the meantime, I welcome your mealy-minded feats of frame analysis.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/polar-star">Polar Star</a> is, basically, rock paper pistol, but with a few dab-handed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> twists that make it instantly compelling.  You're a saloon dwelling varmint sat at a table with nothing but your six shooter and a glass of whiskey for company, and you're accosted by a chain of ne'er-do-wells. Perhaps there's a bounty on your head. Perhaps it's their whiskey you're drinking. It's not clear, but it seems nefarious. You know what ne'er-do-wells are like.</p>

<p>You have three options: drink, prepare, or shoot. Shoot once successfully - while your opponent is drinking - and you win. But if you shoot and fail, you have to use up your other options before you can shoot again. Prepare counters shoots, and drink counters prepare, preventing your opponent from shooting the next round. But, if your opponent also drinks, <em>you</em> can't shoot next round, and if you both shoot at the same time, you both lose. Or, just you lose really. I assume the game doesn't care.</p>
<p>So, simple enough, but then it throws cards into the mix. One reveals what your opponent is going to do next, one resurrects you both the next time you die, and so on. I had to play the tutorial three times to fully grasp that the game wasn't completely chance-based - it doesn't explain itself perfectly - but I went on a nice journey of realising just how neat Polar Star is during those three attempts. The demo is a bit limited, but it does feature an endless mode with card modifiers unlocked.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is how stylish the game is. Low poly smokiness with neon flourishes and nicotine hues, and some southern-fried electronic OST bangers. You can grab the <a href="https://guntlett.itch.io/polar-star-demo">demo here on Itch</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3628980/Polar_Star_Demo/">Steam</a>.

            <p>Last month, Blizzard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-big-collab-is-berserk-yeah-ok-that-ones-pretty-good-i-guess">announced the first of their planned collaboration events</a>/themed cosmetic greed-jamborees for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Kicking things off is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> - Kentaro Miura's dark fantasy manga about a large man swinging a large sword at demons, full of panels that are very good at conveying thrilling duels with a bunch of slash marks and captions that say 'snick' a lot. I'm no superfan, but I do own a few books, and the original anime is one of my favourites - even if its <a href="https://youtu.be/9TRemrRaPjc">brilliant theme song</a> lied to me re: having zero problems in life as long as I'm wearing my glasses.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The cosmetics - four armour sets, a mount, and a pet - are now out, alongside their prices. In brief, buying the whole lot individually (there's no bundle discount or similar available) will set you back 16,500 of Diablo 4's gamerbux, named platinum. To cover that, your best option is the 18,500 platinum bundle. The price? $149.99 US, or £125.99. Cheers <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/diablo-4s-berserk-crossover-dlc-costs-an-insane-usd150">Push Square</a>.</p>
<p>Now, far be it from me to tell you what your money's worth. But (just picking a random example out of the infinite other potential uses for that small fortune) if you popped over to <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/berserk-multi-volume-books">Dark Horse Publishing's website right now</a>, you could pick up the first four deluxe hardbacks of the actual manga for £107. You'd have a few quid leftover too. Perhaps you could buy a very large sippy cup and several gallons of your favourite reading beverage. Yum! Tastes better than a fake fucking horse, anyway. Or, shell out about eight extra quid for volume 5, and you've got the entire Golden Age arc - Guts's origin story, effectively.</p>
<p>Horrific, honestly. Apropos of nothing, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 workers across Activision Blizzard</a> and Xbox early last year. <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/26/video-gamemaker-activision-blizzard-laying-off-400-workers-in-irvine-la/">Activision Blizzard later laid off a further 400</a>. Was this my fault? Please, Blizzard, stop. I'll buy more horses, I promise. I'd ask how the C-suite sleep at night but I already know the answer: without a single dream in their heads that doesn't involve Smaugish wealth hoarding.</p>
<p>If you're new to Berserk, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-guide-to-loving-berserk-the-manga-inspiration-for-the-souls-games">Giada Zavarise's guide to loving it</a>. In other 'everything is Ready Player One now and I want to go take a nap on some train tracks' news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Destiny 2 is doing a Star Wars crossover</a>. Why, if I was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">staffer who got laid off</a> after working hard on establishing the series' expansive lore only for Bungie to squat a fat log on my creative legacy, I'd sure be plum miffed right about now! Sweating, wiping my brow, can't work out whether to press the button that reads 'preserving my sci-fi universe's atmosphere' or the one labelled 'tauntaun reference'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
