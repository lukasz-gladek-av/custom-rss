            <p>A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647">trademark</a>, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1ST</a>, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as "audio, video and multimedia production" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it.</p>
<p>The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-announces-the-result-of-the-share-issue/">acted on Remedy's behalf</a> numerous times in the recent past, including <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-listing/">advising on the company's stock exchange listing</a> and <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-remedys-contract-negotiation-with-annapurna/">helping negotiate</a> the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>'s development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">partnership deal from last year</a>, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction.</p><p>Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.</p>
