            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s next Enhanced boss is Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow, developers From Software have confirmed. You’ll be able to get your teeth into him from June 26th at 4pm Central European Summer Time, 7am Pacific Daylight Time, or 11pm Japan Standard Time.</p>
<p>These timezone distinctions are meaningless, of course, because there is only one timezone in which Fulghor operates, and that timezone is Butt Kicking Time. He’s one of the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s harder scraps, and he’ll be all the worse for being Enhanced.</p><!--more-->
<p>From and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">released the first Enhanced Nightreign boss</a> - aka, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Everdark Sovereign</a> – earlier this month. They got the ball rolling with a hulked-up version of Gaping Jaw, who is an absolute pushover next to Fulghor - third easiest in the game, according to our recommended <a elden-ring-nightreign-main-boss-order"="" href"https:="" www.rockpapershotgun.com="">Elden Ring Nightreign boss play order</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to defeat the base edition of each boss before you can take a pop at the Everdark variety. Beat an Everdark Sovereign before they're taken out of rotation, and you’ll earn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens to spend on special relics. Whether this is worth the terrible tingling sensation of repeated defeat is a question only you, a Gamer, can answer. </p>
<p>Fulghor, then. According to our intrepid guides wrangler John Schutt, you’re best off duelling him with a lightning weapon and some kind of status effect capacity. You’ll want to keep a dispersed formation because Fulghor’s swings cover a lot of ground. But you’ll also want to be close enough to stagger him when he threatens to do his spear-slamming routine. Read more in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-beat-fulghor">Elden Ring: Nightreign - how to beat Fulghor guide</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how the New &amp; Improved Fulghor differs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">past reporting</a> has pointed to a third combat phase. “Third time’s the charm,” I hoot and holler to myself, as I am impaled from below by golden spears. Who's next for Everdarkening? Sentient Pest, apparently. Ah, that's not so bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment]]></content:encoded>
