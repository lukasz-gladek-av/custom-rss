            <p>TallBoys and Critical Reflex have announced an open public playtest for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/militsioner">Militsioner</a>, the immersive sim in which you try to escape a town that swelters in the shadow of an extremely large, temperamental policeman. It would be nice to think the premise has gotten less relevant since we first covered the game in 2021, but I suspect that if you are currently living in, say, Los Angeles, you will find much to relate to. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest has yet to kick off, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041689326?l=english">sign up already on Steam</a>. It'll run for two weeks, and will contain "a fraction of the game with most of the mechanics", which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>- Lonely and needy giant with his wishes, attachments and emotions. Learn how to keep his mood in check or to hide when things go south.</p>
<p>- The town's district, packed with a variety of NPCs, items and secrets. All is systematic, interactable and changing based on the time of day</p>
<p>- Flood creeping in from below - when the giant feels bad, the whole town is submerged in water.</p>
<p>- Gifts to build relationships - most items can be gifted, resulting in unique reactions and outcomes.</p>
<p>- Stealth to hide from the giant's wrath - avoid the light and choose the right time to go for illegal options.</p>
<p>- Evading the giant's hand - hide under awnings and pipelines and wait for the right moment to run for it. The hand might not get everywhere, but it's faster than it looks.</p>
<p>- Complete player freedom. Almost every problem has multiple solutions. There are no wrong ways to play the game.</p></blockquote>
<p>The devs caution that this is a test build and as such, subject to change. In particular, you may notice some missing textures. If you're wondering how Militsioner has come along since we covered it last, they also posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1373530/view/535478173041690500?l=english">progress report</a> earlier this month. Amongst other recent changes, the giant now has an inventory (meaning you can pick his titanic pockets) and the ability to take a day off, which improves his mood and may cause new routes to appear. Townsfolk will now report you for breaking and entering, but you can also persuade them to be your alibi if you're under suspicion.</p>
<p>I've been coming and going with imsims, lately. I think the genre needs some kind of shot in the arm. Perhaps by "shot in the arm" I really mean "King Kopper".

            <p>A bunch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> coverage has surfaced from the internet's soup pot like the bones of that beloved pet hamster you thought had escaped through the scullery. Quickly now, before your darling children see, let's sift through the remains in search of News. Well now! It turns out they're keeping the jokes to a relative minimum in this one. So says Taylor Clark, Borderlands 4's lead writer, in a chat about the game's lush dystopian setting.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's been interesting, perhaps a little depressing to see the Borderlands school of humour degrade over the years from a moderate strength into a definite weakness. Ah, I remember how much we used to love Claptrap. I remember how delighted we all were by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3ehmPeLtdQ">the Wimoweh trailer</a>. I was, anyway. This was back in 2012, when I still enjoyed video games. </p>
<p>Specific hits and misses aside, I guess the basic problem is that you can only do this vein of post-post-ironic, meme-shot chucklefuckery once or twice before it becomes nauseating. There are seven Borderlands games, including spin-offs. I think that is probably four too many - if you've played the second, I'd skip straight to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales From The Borderlands</a>. </p>
<p>Gearbox are, among other things, trying to level the tone out with Borderlands 4, which launches for PC on 12th September, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/eventcomments/603033240727512637?snr=1_5_9_">will not cost $80</a>, despite or possibly thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">much commentary to that effect from Gearboss Randy Pitchford</a>.</p>
<p>"Of course, we were aware of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-3-review">the feedback that Borderlands 3 got</a>, and we took all the valid criticism on board," Clark <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/gearbox-talks-borderlands-4-exploration-fixing-the-meme-humor-and-entering-the-series-simpsons-era/">said of the humour</a> in an interview with VGC. "We're creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet we're on. Pandora was like the Wild West, this new planet is a totalitarian world, so having everybody making jokes every minute wouldn't feel totally right."</p>
<p>That last sentence is, well, it's sort of a Pandora's box, isn't it. Many thoughts, all of them massively obnoxious. On the one hand, <a href="https://lithub.com/is-humor-the-best-antidote-to-tyranny/">humour may be the best antidote to tyranny</a>, on the other, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/24/boris-johnson-plays-clown-hes-really-just-power-hungry-nihilist/">clowns can make great demagogues</a>. It's hard to comment without knowing more about Borderlands 4's idea of totalitarianism. I guess I need to play it now.</p>
<p>There's also the problem of this being Borderlands' "Simpson's era", in Clark's words, although I think he's actually referring to the "Simpsons did it" joke from South Park.</p>
<p>"We're in the writers' room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, 'We did that in Borderlands'," he told the site. "We're always trying not to repeat ourselves; that's why our villains are so different. We're always trying to keep it fresh."</p>
<p>If you never played any of the older Borderlands, 1) I'd be sincerely interested to get your impressions of the 2009 game, and 2) Borderlands 4 is going to be a "fresh start", continuing the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> "with a very different kind of villain than we've had before". According to Clark: "You don't need to have played all the old games to understand it, but you have something that rewards people who are coming from Borderlands 3 and also people who want to jump in, with no experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
