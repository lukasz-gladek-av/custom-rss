            <p>February 1st, 2021. Until yesterday, that was the last time Ubisoft had posted anything on the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman</a> Tweeter account. That outstanding streak has been broken because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platforming series</a> has turned 30, promting the publisher to reaffirm that a team of devs is still busy working on Rayman's future, with news to come, er, not very soon.</p>
<p>Before you shout at me for writing about a games company posting that, yes, they still plan to make video games in the future, this is also a chance to highlight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGyqe1t_JU&amp;t=2s">Rayman Alive 2025</a>, a pretty hefty community showcase of fan projects helping to keep the aged limbless being's legacy alive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an appearance at the end of that fan-run event, Rayman producer Loic Gounon and composer Christophe Heral did all the thanking you'd expect, while also providing that brief update on Raymond Man's status. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman," Gounon reaffirmed. "Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>Heral then whipped out a rather delightful banjo and delivered some sweet tuneage while Rayman stood on a plant leaf next to him, blankly staring into the void. Ubisoft added that the likes of exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes dev interviews will be put out in the coming months.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>ðŸ‘Š ðŸŽ‰Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy ðŸŽ‚ðŸ¥³</p><p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p></div>â€” Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Anyway, this served as the climax of Rayman Alive 2025, which is organised by <a href="https://x.com/VnheardVoices">Vnheard</a>, creator of unofficial Raymanimated series <a href="https://x.com/Rayman_SL">Rayman: Scepter of Leptys</a>. There were cameos from a whole host of Rayfan projects throught the showcase, including Rayman: Origins mod <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/617018">Ales Origins</a>, fan comic <a href="https://x.com/clairiphi/status/1962604349277843650">Rayman Nightmarish</a>, and <a href="https://raymanbeatbox.tonocatmeow.com/">Rayman Legends Beatbox</a>, the latter of which you can fire up in your browser and have Rayman shred some fat bass guitar riffs as you work.</p>
<p>There's a full list of featured projects in the description, and as ever with these sorts of community showcases, there's a chance you'll find something you dig in there. Hey, given how long it might be until Ubisoft do a Rayman tweet again, the Rayfans'll need it.</p>
