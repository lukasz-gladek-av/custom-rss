            <p>
Which sounds like the more intense experience to you, dear reader - "Butterfly's Guidance" or "Awakened Puppet"? No, this isn't me workshopping titles for my latest range of exotic fragrances. I'm referring to the new easier difficulty modes Neowiz will add to Pinnochio-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> alongside the game's Overture DLC this summer.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty modes will arrive in a free Lies Of P update. The standard difficulty will be "Legendary Stalker", which honestly I think is a bit of a letdown, after "Butterfly's Guidance" and "Awakened Puppet". It barely sounds like an exotic fragrance at all. Possibly you could peddle it as some kind of feline musk.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-is-getting-difficulty-options-to-make-the-soulslike-more-accessible/">VGC</a>, game director Jiwon Choi explained that "we wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game," adding that the new modes are based partly on player feedback. "[By] making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players," he said. "This broadens the base."
</p>
<p>
This would be an obvious time to rekindle the debate about difficulty, accessibility, and the toxicity of "git gud" culture. Let me extend an avuncular arm and say: come now, friends, that debate is surely over. I think everybody agrees that giving players options that reflect their needs or preferences is fundamentally a good thing, and that there is no reason such options can't be consistent with, say, an atmosphere of abiding menace or a sense of gruelling challenge - after all, most video games and certainly, all mainstream commercial video games assist and guide players in myriad, subtle ways, even when you're playing on Mega-Bastard difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Instead, let's argue about appropriate difficulty mode naming. I have a feeling I've ranted somewhere about this before? Call me Johnny Obfuscation but I like it when developers clown around a bit with their nomenclature. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>'s European Extreme, for example, or Ready To Rhombus in <a href="http://adventuresofsquare.com/">The Adventures Of Square</a>. European Extreme is definitely some kind of abrasive cologne: it conjures up visions of dyed chest hair and revolting suede. Ready To Rhombus, meanwhile, sounds like a whimsical hemp-based aftershave with a handwritten label, sold exclusively in Camden Town.
</p>
<p>
Difficulty settings aside, Lies Of P is also getting a couple of new bossfight modes. In Battle Memories, you can replay bosses through five difficulty tiers. In Death March, you must fell as many bosses as possible with limited health and items. Again, it's all coming this summer.

            <p>Borderlands boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">submitted an-all timer entry into the pantheon of neoliberal thirst tweets</a> earlier this week, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">telling a player concerned</a> about a potential $80 asking price for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> that "if you're a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen", before telling an anecdote about how, when he were a lad, he used to lick the fleas from unwashed goats for quarters to play Bubble Bobble, or something.</p>
<p>This went down about as well as you'd expect, prompting Pitchford to yesterday follow-up with a clip of him on a panel talking about a potential price increase in, wait for it, much more sober and considered terms. So, in the interest of not only reporting on Pitchford when he says something incredibly stupid (although, lets be real, only because it's related, I'm still muckraking here) <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">here's the clip</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about the game's price, Pitchford says he doesn't know. "It's an interesting time, right? We've got a competitive marketplace. We want people to buy it so we've got the resources to make more. The people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. We want everyone who buys and plays a Gearbox game to feel certain they got the better end of the bargain."</p>
<p>"Game budgets are increasing," he continues. "There's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget (of 3)". Then he veers off to talk about his philosophy of entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>There's surely debates to be had about some of the points Pitchford raises although, crucially, none of it puts the onus on "fans" to be "real" enough to go lick fleas from goats for pennies. Why didn't you just say all this in the first place, Pitchford? I understand Twitter is where nuance goes to die, but don't tell me that you're above long threads now. Also, no, having a character in Borderlands 4 reference your original tweet to reframe your idiot posting as a charming foible will not absolve you of this. Although it would at least be refreshingly recent as far as Borderlands references go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3231480/Dreamspring/">The Steam trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreamspring">Dreamspring</a> contains: shooting spiders with a revolver. Hanging out near a green ocean. Fighting green skeletons. Most curiously, it features an armoured knight convulsing on a bed as if being shocked, from the inside, by some sort of magical electricity disease. Did this knight eat an entire pack of bad batteries? Do batteries even exist in this world, described as "a realm in ruins…beneath a twilight sky". It's a damn hell ass bum mystery, and mystery is exactly what I want from a game that lists both Morrowind and King's Field as influences.</p>

<p>"As a spellsword gunslinger," - truly, the millionaire astronaut cowboy DJ of RPG classes  - "you'll explore ethereal landscapes shrouded in twilight, battle fearsome creatures, and uncover ancient secrets. Explore the dying Kingdom of Mortis and its different realms in first person action combat, in a world mixed with retro and vaporwave aesthetics".</p>
<p>Despite the FromSoft influence, Dreamspring is aiming to be "a less punishing type of Souls/Scrolls-like game," which I reckon is something that gets more important the bigger your world is. Otherwise, it looks to have most of the stuff you'd expect - branching dialogue, branching storyline, branching trees with branches branching toward an uncaring skyline, all the classics. It's in early access at the moment, with the "core loop" apparently done, and the main quest and world still being worked on.</p>
<p>There's no demo, although developer Billyfighter's previous game Necroslayer is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2563960/Necroslayer">roughly the price of Greggs' bake at the moment</a>. Will you feel good after playing it? I can't say. But you will likely feel better than after eating a Greggs' bake.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
