            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> has been through a sizeable array of changes since launch in February next year, amid some very uncivilised reactions to boat-rocking features like the new age format. The next update, Test Of Time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-big-test-of-time-update-thatll-bring-back-playing-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-is-set-to-drop-this-spring">will restore the ability to play as one civilization through the whole game</a>, while making changes to how victories are earned in the hope of creating some lategame variety.</p>
<p>All these tweaks and rejigs invite a more fundamental question. “Why didn’t they just launch it as an early access game?” I remember moaning to another journalist last year. I should have directed my moaning at executive producer Dennis Shirk, who says that Firaxis are tentatively open to the idea and, indeed, “jealous” of developers taking this approach.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That’s a snippet from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">an Ars Technica interview</a> this week in which Shirk and franchise creative director Ed Beach look back on the transition from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization VI</a> to Civilization VII, and what they might try with the hypothetical Civilization 8.</p>
<p>One of the major changes with Civilization VI was that Firaxis had access to lot more player telemetry, compared to Civilisation V, rather than monitoring the feedback on Reddit and fansites like CivFanatics. Amongst other things, they discovered that most players don’t finish a single game, which is part of the reason for Civ 7’s more broken-up, modular historical progression.
</p><p>
Based on the reaction to Civ 7, the devs are trying to get hold of that feedback earlier in development of new mechanics or systems. “It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” Beach told the site.</p>
<p>With publisher 2K’s input, the Frankenstein Group is being expanded into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">a larger and more structured playtesting program, the Firaxis Feature Workshop</a>. (I enjoy the implication that a bunch of mad scientists have gone mainstream – I’m picturing Doc Brown, Doctor Octopus and Doctor Eggman at an investor fare, explaining the nutritional benefits of formaldehyde to passing soccer moms.)
</p>
<p>
Officially embracing full early access development (not just preorder-baiting ‘advanced access’) would surely make a lot of sense for Civ, even discounting the ire aimed at Civ 7. After all, even the best 4X strategy games tend to evolve a lot throughout their shelf lives. Ars Technica popped the question, and Shirk had this to say: “It’s one of those things that you can never say never. As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.” 
</p>
<p>
Even so, I doubt it’ll ever happen, because when you present yourself as selling an unfinished game, it’s harder to charge $70 or more for it upfront. Still, perhaps the wilting fortunes of Civ 7 will persuade 2K and Take-Two Interactive to be more calculating with the game's development process.</p><p>Civ 7 set a series record for preorders, but has struggled to match its predecessors in terms of Steam concurrent users. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">Speaking in August last year</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confessed that the game had gotten off to a “slow start” with the caveat that “Civ has always been a slow burn” and “right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.” The publishers have yet to share any total sales figures.
</p>
<p>
The broader question around Civ going early access is whether “early access” really means anything, any more, inasmuch as “early access” has sort of bled into “live service". Most games of a certain scale receive a number of updates post-launch, and players have come to expect them, with a vocal minority pillorying games as “dead” if too many months go past without substantial changes. I think there’s probably a longer feature to write there – do you have any thoughts?

            <p>Everything's a show! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAhmWlS8sY">Everything's a show</a>! Everything's a show! Everything's a show! Did you know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> is a show? Well, it will be soon. One that'll carry on from the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and star characters both old and new. Baldur's Gate 3 developers Larian, though, don't seem to be directly involved outside of the show's boss asking if he can pop into their studio for a chat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a> report that this Baldur’s Gate HBO drama is set to be helmed by Craig Mazin, co-creator of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>' TV adaptation, who'll write, executive produce and showrun it. As you might expect, a bunch of executive producing chairs have also been assigned to bigwigs at Hasbro and subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, the current owners of the Baldur's Gate series/name/all of its various bits.</p>
<p>According to Deadline, the BG show won't be a relatively straightforward adaption of tales the games have already told, instead aiming to be a "continuation to the games, telling a story that takes place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3, as the characters — old and new — are dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third game".</p>
<p>The site add that the show, which isn't tied to meshing with any new Baldur's Gate games in development, "draws deeply" from BG3 and "not so much from the first two games which are not official source material". From the sounds of it, the older entries' influence might be limited to wider themes/bits which form part of all three games and are key aspects of wider DnD lore. Mazin also reportedly plans to reach out to some of Baldur's Gate 3's voice actors in the hopes of potentially getting them involved in the show.</p><p>Despite the Baldur's Gate 3 emphasis here, that game's devs Larian don't look to be directly involved in crafting the show, at least in terms of having full hands-on roles like Bethesda have with Amazon's Fallout adaptation. That arguably isn't entirely surprising, given they've moved back to working on their own games post-BG3 with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">Divinity</a>, rather than agreeing to make a Baldur's Gate 4 with Hasbro's blessing.</p>
<p>Larian boss Swen Vincke's opted to take the <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143">diplomatic approach</a> to news of the show. "The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures," he wrote, adding that to his knowledge none of Larian's writers are consulting on the show. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."</p>
<p>Larian publishing head Michael Douse, meanwhile, has opted to take a slightly less diplomatic approach. Going on a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp">retweeting spree </a>of random folks' posts about not watching the show now they've learned Larian won't be crafting it directly. He also had a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019586400476164184">wee shout at Deadline</a> for not asking Larian about the show prior to publishing their article and responded to a Geoff Keighley post about Larian not being involved in the series by writing: "except that we made it popular enough for it to be referred to as Baldur's Gate 3". Finally, he's gathered some thoughts into <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680">a thread</a> that's rather less unhinged and essentially boils down to hoping the show does the work of Baldur's Gate 3's writers justice.</p>
<p>We'll see if it does, but there's no timeline been given as of yet for when the show'll arrive.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"I think a lot of survival games are really boring," Geoff 'Zag' Keene, founder of Deep Field Games, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> adjacent co-op survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>, said in a recent interview. However, despite these strong words, please hold onto your spit take for just a moment.</p>
<p>It's not the first time Keene's said something like it and, in fact, in <a href="https://gamemakersnotebook.libsyn.com/abiotic-factor-with-geoff-zag-keene-and-henry-feltham">the episode of The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook</a>, he's responding to a question about when he said it to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/abiotic-factor-interview-survival-immersive-sim/">cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer back in 2024</a>. So, please, calmly swallow your spit take liquid of choice, so I can explain why I'm reporting on something Keene originally said two years ago.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Abiotic Factor is a survival game that throws out a lot of what you find in stalwarts of the genre. Rather than building a life on an abandoned island by cutting down trees, planting crops, and using crafting benches to expand your toolbox until you've built a somewhat secure life for yourself in a virtual wilderness, you put on the pocket-protector-fitted lab coat of a scientist having a hell of a day in an underground facility going through a containment breach.</p>
<p>If you've played through Half-Life, the set up, at least, is a lot like the beginning of Gordon Freeman's adventure in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a>. There's been an incident, everything is on fire, and it's up to you to explore the facility and try to put things right. Scavenging resources from the environment to cobble together weapons and equipment as you go.</p>

</figure>
<p>While Keene starts from the same place in the podcast, that original quote from 2024, he takes his answer in a different direction, reflecting on a game that only came out at the end of last year. Perhaps you can guess what it is…</p><p>"I find a lot of survival games very boring," Keene continued, ignoring the future RPS writers who would need to provide context for why they're writing a news article about previously said words. "I find a lot of them... just ticking off boxes, and going through the motions. They have hunger, thirst, and all this other stuff, but they don't have anything of substance."</p>
<p><em>[If you're listening along, I'll let you in on a secret. I'm actually skipping ahead in the interview a bit here, so I can create a structural coherence to his answer that will have a more dramatic payoff.]</em></p>
<p>"I find a lot of survival games are just doing mechanics, flooding content in, and it's so meaningless," Keene continued, definitely not skipping anything out in between. "It's iterations of the same thing. I play one game and I play another and it looks different but it's got the same mechanics that I just played and no story to set it apart. I'll try out a survival game on Next Fest, my timer is 10 minutes per game before I'm like 'Eh, not interested.'"</p>
<figure>

<p>While loaded up with <em>stuff</em> to do, what's missing, Keene says, is attention paid to the world. "We've all played Early Access survival game #27. [It's] in the forest with trees chopping, picking up rocks, but there's no wind or ambience in the air because it's not finished yet," Keene said. "If you're going to ship the game to the public, make sure it has some of the mood and the atmosphere. I don't know if I'm that good of a game developer, I don't think we've turned the survival genre on its head or anything, but we know how to [establish] our tone right, our mood, and the atmosphere of the game. Look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, that's like 90% of the battle, getting a place that people want to exist in."</p><p>Coming from a different place, I arrived at a similar conclusion when writing about Arc Raiders for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-good-shooter-but-its-also-where-i-go-for-a-walk-and-relax">last year's Advent Calendar</a>. Its take on a ruined Earth is somewhere I play, but often it's just a world I like to spend time in. Even with all the killer robots. There is a sometimes beautiful, sometimes mournful peace that hangs over the landscape. While there are many other extraction shooters, and several big names in the space before Arc Raiders came along, I've not found that peace playing the others. There is always a tension in the air, and, while there is a lot of fun to be had, I won't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> or Hunt: Showdown are chill games.</p>
<p>Also being interviewed was Henry Feltham, Abiotic factor's producer and narrative designer. He says how the team landed on two of the game's defining qualities: "The obvious ones we inverted. Being inside rather than outside, and being smart rather than strong. It doesn't take a lot to give the whole thing a completely different vibe."</p>
<p>I'd recommend listening to the whole interview. Not only do the developers dive into their many attempts to make the game without guns, there's also a story about DayZ creator Dean Hall pitching his game Icarus for Google Stadia while he snowboarded down a mountain.</p>
