Probably one of the most appealing parts of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is bonding with other characters, right? Building up your player character's relationships with various companions, like in games like the Persona series for example. What I wouldn't say is particularly common is you, the player, having a direct relationship with the character you're playing as. This is where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/downhill">Downhill</a> comes in, a fourth wall breaking action RPG whose main character knows you exist and controls them, all the while having to figure out a way to save the world.

"The idea of power and its abuse is what lies at the core of Downhill," Sisterhood Games, the developer of Downhill, explain in the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sisterhoodgames/downhill-a-unique-4th-wall-breaking-arpg">Kickstarter page</a>. "Each time we start a new RPG game, we take full control of a character, but what if that character had a will of their own? Moreover, what if it oftentimes clashed with your vision for your playthrough?"

A fourth wall break in an indie RPG is nothing new, that's kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>'s whole deal to a degree (a game cited as an inspiration, alongside how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> communicates to the player directly). But what sells me on Downhill is the way in which you develop a relationship with its protagonist Fade. Do you want to help her in any way you can, or do you want to fight against her? You can talk to her at any point throughout the game, various dialogue options affecting how she thinks of you.
</p>
<p>
That might mean doing something simple as asking how she is, or forcing her to fight an enemy. I wouldn't say subtlety is the name of the game here, it's clearly going to be a game where you question your role in the way games play out. I just really like the presentation of it all. There's a really unique dark fantasy aesthetic to it with some good, creepy-looking creatures to fight, and the twist on RPG dialogue options being that you're conversing with your own character is a fun one.
</p>
<p>
You can revive Fade as many times as you want too without having to load your save data, but that comes with the cost of it causing her mental distress. Obviously you can't tell everything from a game without playing it, but it certainly sounds like there's a thoughtfulness as to how commonplace mechanics can affect the characters you play as. Good stuff!
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the game is currently looking for funds on Kickstarter, so you can chuck a few quid your way if it takes your fancy. It's also available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3433000/DOWNHILL/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and there's a short demo for you to check out too if you're not convinced enough to support the fundraiser just yet.

Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.
</p>

<p>
Global community director at CD Projekt Red Marcin Momot <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">took to Jitter</a> to share that the team is "not done yet! Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.
