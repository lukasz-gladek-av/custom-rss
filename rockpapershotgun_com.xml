Back in April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical">Stray Gods: A Roleplaying Musical</a> developer Summerfall Studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-writer-teases-a-new-arcane-deckbuilder-from-his-stray-gods-studio">launched their Kickstarter for Malys</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder where you play as a "former priest turned demon-hunter" that certainly looked quite atmospheric. This is the same studio co-founded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so it's not like they came out of nowhere. However, it fell a bit short of meeting its goal, something that quite often guarantees that death of a game. Except it just launched into early access this week. Go figure!
</p>

<p>
Let's add a bit of context as to how that came to be, as explained by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> project director Liam Esler in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-one-malys-early-access">devlog post</a>. The team always had a plan on how to get to 1.0 for Malys, "but games like this live and die on their communities." With the Kickstarter failing, that changed plans, leading them to need more feedback than they'd originally intended, hence the early access release.

<p>
"The community response both to the game itself and to our team has been overwhelmingly kind, and even though Malys isnâ€™t quite where weâ€™d ideally like it to be for a public launch, we feel bringing this current version of the game to Early Access is the best step we can take", Esler explains.
</p>
<p>
One thing that he also made clear is that "this is very much a work in progress build of the game. Early Access on Steam in 2025 is nowadays games that are â€˜mostly doneâ€™, excluding adding additional content. If you donâ€™t want to play a version of the game that is in-progress, we donâ€™t recommend buying this Early Access version and instead waiting for the 1.0." A caveat was added that the price will go up after early access too, so keep that in mind depending on how much faith you have in the team.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the plan is to put out gameplay updates "about once every three weeks", which will range from planned content, adjustments based on feedback, and bugs. In terms of what's currently included, there's the first region, a "segment" of story, and a "variety of cards/ curios to choose from." A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3449690/view/525346350588493892?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the early access also lists some known bugs for you to keep in mind too.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, it sounds like Summerfall Studios are taking another big swing here after not quite managing to make contact with that Kickstarter. Good luck to them, I say, the game looks neat.

Right now, I can't really tell you much of what A Short Hike developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">adamgryu</a> is working on. He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamgryu.bsky.social/post/3ls5lvip3nc2j">shared a little look</a> at whatever is next last week, and it certainly looks adjacent to A Short Hike vibes wise - we'll come back to this one with the tiniest of details in a bit. At the very least, I can certainly tell you what he's not working on: a game called <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game">Untitled Paper RPG</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As described by adamgryu, Untitled Paper RPG is an "untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> inspired by the classic Paper Mario games. Itâ€™s got turn-based combat with quick time events and a detailed overworld to explore." This of course begs the question why I'm telling you about this game at all if it's ostensibly cancelled. Well, last week the indie dev actually shared a short one to two hour long demo of the game, essentially the entirety of what was made. Adamgryu also offered up a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo">short blog post</a> explaining the project a bit, and what led to it now being officially cancelled.

Untitled Paper RPG initially started development back in 2016, after adamgryu saw the announcement for Paper Mario Color Splash. "I was nostalgic for the old style of Paper Mario and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see?" he explains. After leaving his job in 2017, he set out to make indie games, but while working on this one in late 2018 he took a break and started on A Short Hike. "It unexpectedly did really well for me! I had planned to go back to my RPG at some point, but there was still a lot of work I could do on A Short Hike."
</p>
<p>
In the end, his reason behind "sort of" cancelling the game was a simple one: after putting out A Short Hike, he just "didnâ€™t really want to go back to this game? The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but Iâ€™ve been working on other things and donâ€™t see myself making time for this RPG in near future."
</p>
<p>
Adamgryu then listed out a few of the reasons that working on the game felt "overwhelming," including the classic issue of the scope feeling too big, not actually having a story, and having doubts over the turn-based combat system. He ultimately decided to release this demo partially because some people still ask about it, so "sharing the demo is better than nothing."
</p>
<p>
Back to that GIF of one of his upcoming games, Adamgryu also shared that this is an action adventure game he's working on. It's one of three projects he's tinkering away at, including a micro-RPG with a claymation aesthetic, and an online platforming roguelike.
</p>
<p>
It's often sad when exciting games get cancelled, but it's also rare that we in the first instance get this much insight as to why, and in the second have the ability to actually play some of it. There's a value to be found in something that's incomplete. I often think about Satoshi Kon's Opus, a manga he never finished before his death in 2010, and how it's then forced to leave so much to the imagination of the reader. What would Untitled Paper RPG have become? Perhaps a worse game than what its demo presents! So let's appreciate what we do have instead.
