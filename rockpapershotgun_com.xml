When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).

The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.

Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.

Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
