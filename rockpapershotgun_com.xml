I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to  admit that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.

I'm glad that like many games before it, it's copying Breath of the Wild's climbing so you can scale pretty much any clifface. Once you're up there you can do the video game staple that is scanning your environment to reveal the nearby area on your map, which will highlight shipwrecks or abandoned testing stations. You know, the Ubisoft effect. What actually makes that kind of interesting are the coriolis storms.

Most of the times storms in video games are just about blocking your vision, preventing you from going somewhere, maybe making it harder for you to be seen by enemies and vice versa, but Dune: Awakening's coriolis storms change the entire map every single week. Being an online survival game, obviously this is something to keep players coming back so that it feels fresh week to week, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> can execute it well it could make for an interesting time, the headaches for cartographers aside.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to jump into the game, you can't quite do that yet because it's not out until May 20th. However! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-time-to-create-a-character-and-benchmark-a-sandworm-in-dune-awakening-assuming-youre-buying-it-in-may">You can already make your character ahead of its release</a>, so you've got plenty of time to make a cooler, more sci-fiy version of yourself, or some nightmarish creation you post on social media for 11 likes.

            <p>
Remember when Nvidia announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> RTX mod way back in, crikey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-rtx-mod-brings-ray-tracing-and-dlss-to-another-valve-classic">2023</a>? Yeah, I didn't realise how long it had been either. To be perfectly honest I thought it had already come out, but apparently not, because just this week Nvidia shared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-rtx">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> is getting a demo next week on March 18th. No, the full mod still doesn't have a release date, but when do any game projects ever release quickly after they were announced?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo will specifically let you play through the Ravenholm and Nova <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prospekt">Prospekt</a> levels, and a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">really long blog post from Nvidia</a> has desperately tried to make it clear all of the ways this mod supposedly makes the original game look better. Apparently "every aspect of each level has been upgraded" and everything from weapons, to enemies, to skyboxes have all been remade.

<p>
Nvidia's blog post lets you do that thing where you can slide an image back and forth to see what it looks like with RTX on and off, and to be perfectly honest, most of the time it doesn't look better, it just looks foggier. The original game still looks incredible to this day if you ask me, there's a reason so many people still love it. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, most people aren't going to be able to play the dang thing anyway - the post notes that to "play at the level of detail shown in the screenshots and videos seen in this article, we recommend a GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card," even if there are ways to supposedly "ensure a great experience on previous-generation GPUs, too." I don't think I want to turn my PC into a jet engine for a 20 year old game, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
The base version of Half-Life 2 actually got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">pretty nice update</a> last November for its 20th anniversary, which folded Episodes One and Two into the main package, and even fixed some old bugs. Cheers for that again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a>.
