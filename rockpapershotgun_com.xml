            <p>Historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> will get new culture mechanics in its 2.0 update, developers Oxide Games and publishers Stardock have announced. As with culture features in certain Civilization games and - well, the only other specimen that comes to mind right now is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins Of A Solar Empire</a>, this will allow you to claim territory without firing a shot, by dint of being way fancier and more refined than all those yokels across the border. Should the aforesaid yokels remain unmoved by your splendour, there's also a new Agitator unit that can be sent into foreign parts to foment rebellion.</p><!--more-->
<p>Agitators aside, the Revolutions update introduces a bunch of military units specific to each civ, such as Japanese Samurai and Mongol Horse Archers, and treats leader characters to a revamp with distinct traits and abilities.</p>
<p>They've introduced more "realistic natural resource clustering" for map generation together with revised rules for trade, and boldly claim to have made the AI smarter. But returning players may be most beguiled by the hot and spicy talk of cutting down on micromanagement. They've replaced the old production queues with "smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy". Filth!</p>
<p>All of which sounds like it might go some way towards addressing Sin's criticisms in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">Ara: History Untold review</a>. "Empire-building re-envisaged as managing elaborate production chains, then re-re-envisaged as another 4X with repetitive micromanagement and weak, bland AI," was her brusque summary. It sounds like the bulk of the audience agreed, for the Revolutions update boasts of being heavily inspired by player feedback.</p><p>How does Culture work in Ara? It's a new quality of life category that generates Influence, this being a currency that can be spent on cultural traits and territory expansion, saving you the need for armed invasion. The Agitator unit is the basis for a second form of conquest that becomes available in the game's second act: ideological subversion.</p>
<p>According to Stardock CEO and Oxide co-founder Brad Wardell, these new methods of assimilation are partly designed to liven up the lategame, once the whole map has been exposed and the rival civs are fairly entrenched.</p>
<p>The update will make some technical improvements - "a sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options" plus "major engine optimizations [that] deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage". It's out 24th September, but there's a beta version available now - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338294049112358?l=english">read more on Steam</a>, where Wardell has also posted some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338927350218798?l=english">lengthy reflections</a> about the workings of strategy game AI.</p>

            <p>Hola, big Steam update alert, featuring some stuff you might already have tried in beta and a crap tonne of other stuff you might not have. Either way, it's all in the hands of the masses now, so worth being aware of. Yes, "removed a setting from music settings that wasn't hooked up to anything" is a change you need to know about, don't question me!</p>
<p>You can find the full notes for this latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500583527919651039?l=english">Steam update here</a>, and I advise you whip out your best Sunday Papers pipe and slippers when you do, because there are bullet points for days. In the meantime here's a quick rundown that you can safely consume without old man tobacco and weird indoor shoes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A couple of this update's headliners are things Valve made sure to draw attention to when they were in beta testing. Most noteworthy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order">the ability to set custom sort names for games in your library</a>, which means you can put all of the entries in series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> into the correct order, rather than the default alphabetical one that's all wrong. You can set custom artwork for games too, if you'd rather stare at a lewdly tasteful fanart header whenever you fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you'll find the wider store pages Gabe Newell and co were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/532106189043925405?l=english">shouting about mid-August</a>. Other bits which've caught my eye as not having been paraded around as much while they were in beta include the addition of an accessibility settings menu to desktop mode, with options like high contrast, reduced motion settings, and interface scale controls. I assume the last one may involve bigger fonts.</p><p>The performance monitoring bit of the Steam overlay has gotten a fair few changes, with the ability to keep track of your CPU's temperature when playing something incredibly hardware intensive like, er, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, being the main one. "On Windows this requires a kernel mode driver, and there is an option to disable if you don't want that," Valve write of this hot new feature. "The driver is only installed and running when performance monitor is visible at full CPU detail levels and only if you don't disable the driver in the in-game settings."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the fixes department Valve have dealt with "a case where Xbox and PlayStation controllers could be duplicated when Steam input is enabled". Given the wording, I assume they had to get Inspector Clouseau in to suss out the cause of that multiplying device mystery. Then, there's that removed music settings setting, which I kind of wish they'd left in place since it was apparently just chilling doing nothing. Oh, and macOS 11 has officially been put on "end of life alert" ahead of support for it being ditched on October 15th, so maybe look at switching if that's what you're running.</p>
<p>Right, now go get your Assassin's Creeds in the right order, on the double, chop chop, other phrases which mean speed up.</p>
