A little over three years since it was announced, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreamsettler">Dreamsettler</a>, the spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, has been cancelled. Yesterday, lead developer Jay Tholen shared a video simply titled "Dreamsettler is canceled", where he explained some of his reasoning behind the decision. "This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of the video.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
After noting that he "didn't want to make a video like this," the developer went on to explain that Dreamsettler is cancelled, going on to say that this means "it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."

<p>
He also noted how it was bad timing given that a Patreon to help keep the project going was only launched earlier this year. There are also plans to try to release the part of the game that do exist, including the soundtrack from returning composer The Chowder Man, in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
In a short version of events, Tholan explained that with Dreamsettler, they had a budget this time, so "we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time." In turn, there was a specific schedule to follow, and Tholen noted he has "never successfully made a game based on a design document."
</p>
<p>
He later said that he thinks he's a "hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."
</p>
<p>
In the years since announcing Dreamsettlers, Tholen did also work on Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, a boomer shooter spin-off made by the in-world Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane - former RPS staffer Liam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slayers-x-terminal-aftermath-vengance-of-the-slayer-review-a-boisterous-hypnospace-spin-off-thats-an-obnoxious-gem">reviewed it</a> and had some positive but mixed feelings on it. Co-founder John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypnospace-outlaw-review">reviewed</a> Hypnospace Outlaw back in the day too, coming away from it quite enamoured.

            <p>
Ever since Gravity Rush 2 came out eight years ago (let's not focus too hard on how much time that actually is for my mental health), I have, unfortunately, not been able to stop thinking about it. It is a game with a world full of whimsy, video game ass mechanics, and, most interestingly of all, a plot that quite directly deals with topics like class. What more can you want! And yet a sequel has never materialised. Lucky for me, just yesterday a new gravity shifting game entered the scene: Metro Gravity.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Metro Gravity isn't just a clone of Gravity Rush. Where the PlayStation game lets you control gravity at will, Metro Gravity lets you walk on almost any surface, with the option to lock in the gravity of wherever you're standing. There are abilities that let you shift gravity in particular directions, but what is essentially the power of flight isn't available to you in Metro Gravity (at least, in as much of the game as I have played).
</p>

<p>
There are more twists beyond that too. Its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> combat is rhythm-game adjacent in that enemies will attack you to the beat of whatever track is playing at any given moment (these vary from place to place, more on that in a second). A short while into the game you'll pick up the ability to parry a la Sekiro, and with that in hand the combat becomes an artful balance of dodging, blocking, and attacking at just the right moments. It's oh so delicious, if it's your kind of thing anyway.
</p>
<p>
The final spin, and perhaps the biggest, is that it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Most metroidvanias typically take the route of the second dimension rather than the third, and with the fact that Metro Gravity lets you walk on any wall, you might rightly have a fear that it becomes confusing to navigate. I haven't found that yet myself, as while it took me a moment to adjust in terms of my spatial reasoning, when you find a map of a particular area - these range in aesthetics and vibes, and consequently music, and thusly an array of music to time your attacks to - it becomes fairly simple to figure out where to go.
</p>
<p>
I quite like what I've played of Metro Gravity, I often think about how there aren't enough 3D metroidvanias in the world, and I feel quite excited to jump back into this one! The game just launched on Steam yesterday, and you can check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">here</a>.

I know this is a PC games focused outlet, but I'd like to present to you the most PS3 coded game I've seen in a long while: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chains-of-lukomoyre">Chains of Lukomoyre</a>. Now, to be clear I mean this in the most loving of ways possible. That era of video games obviously set the foundations for the rinse and repeat we see in a lot of triple-A games these days, but there was still the occasional oddity out there that just had the right vibe. And I think Chains of Lukomoyre fits that vibe quite well.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In terms of plot, the game features a Slavic folklore inspired setting in an alternate post-WW1 world where "Allied experiments shattered reality itself." I'm no fan of war, but I certainly am a fan of reality shattering experiments. You play as a soldier on a quest to find a lost love, meeting all sorts of weird creatures along the way in a story that's described as a "reimagining of Orpheus and Eurydice through the lens of war, memory, and myth." There's a giant black cat, a hut with chicken legs, a creepy nesting doll, lots of good stuff.

<p>
It's a third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> too, and while the announcement trailer does show off some gameplay, it doesn't show a huge amount of what you're doing. The thing that really makes me say "oh, it's a PS3 game" is the presence of quick-time events, a staple of the console honestly. This isn't particularly exciting because nobody really likes quick-time events, it's really the mixture of Slavic folklore and wartime aesthetics that's luring me in. I've had enough of western fairytales, it's about time other cultures get their time to shine.
</p>
<p>
In any case, as of now Chains of Lukomoyre doesn't have a release date in sight, but you can at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3746310/Chains_of_Lukomorye/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
Unfortunately, it's that time of the month again. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developer 1047 Games shared a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341958451004088321/">post on LinkedIn</a> announcing that layoffs had taken place at the company. It was described as a "small group of valued 1047 Games team members," but as is par for the course for games industry layoffs, there was no mention of how many have been laid off - though of course the usual spiel about "redirecting resources" to make the game better. You know, classic corporation speak.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Notably, co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have apparently "opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project." This is normally where I'd say something like "credit where credit is due", because Proulx's father Tom Proulx is literally the co-founder of Intuit, a huge American software company, so I don't imagine him to be particularly hard done by with this decision. And, you know, this is the same guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wore that ridiculous hat at Summer Game Fest</a>, so you'll be hearing no compliments from me.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear as to whether this means Splitgate 2 is underperforming at all at the moment. The hat thing wasn't the only controversy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> faced, as the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">launched with some pretty ridiculous prices for some of its in-game items</a>. A one-two punch of a bad PR move and extortionate prices does not a healthy community make. In any case, as always I hope everyone that's been affected by the layoffs is able to land on their feet.

            <p>
As it stands, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is not doing so hot. Across the board it's not been received entirely positively (including by our own James, you can read his review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">here</a>), not exactly the ideal launch for a live service game. All the same, it being a live service game might ultimately be its benefit thanks to the power of that mystical force called "updates." In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274">Steam post</a> shared by the FBC: Firebreak team, some planned improvements were outlined, which certainly sound like they'd make for a better experience.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First of all, the team made one thing clear: the game "will improve." Remedy explained that they've been listening to all of the feedback so far, and asked for any more that anyone might have. In terms of immediate plans for changes, the first thing they list is improving the first hour experience. They acknowledge that this is due to a "combination of things," like poor onboarding, how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> systems actually work, clarity in what to do in jobs, and there being too much of a grind for higher-tier weapons.
</p>
<p>
In terms of onboarding, Remedy plan to better communicate the "synergies between Crisis Kits and giving players much better information on what to do in the Jobs and how to be more effective in doing the work that Firebreakers must do." That means harmful conditions, like being on fire, being more readable. 
</p>
<p>
A new patch that arrived yesterday has already made it easier to access jobs, as you no longer need to play the first two clearance levels of each job, and completing the full job unlocks the next full job. The patch has also made Lost Assets and Research Samples more highlighted visually, so that it's harder to miss them. It's also rebalanced how much all of the unlockables cost too, and things like Altered Augments, Improvised Devices, and powerful weapons are easier to access. All of this was done to help with dealing with that grind.
</p>
<p>
There's a few more specifics in the Steam post you can read for yourself, and you can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920272?l=english">here</a>.
