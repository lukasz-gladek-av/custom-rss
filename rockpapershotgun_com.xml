            <p>If you've been waiting to bless one of your friends with an entire dump truck worth of games in a series they've enjoyed one entry of, then good news. Valve have made Steam's 'complete the set' bundles giftable, with prices adjusting to match whichever bits the recipient might already own - so you're not in danger of hurling someone their second copy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> on one storefront.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The steamywatchers over at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3mctvj67hwf27">SteamDB</a> were  the first to spot that this sort of bundle gifting's now allowed. I've given it a quick test that involved momentarily holding the nearly £120 Fallout series bundle over the heads of several Steam friends.</p>
<p>You'll be glad to hear that the price changed in relation to the games in the bundle they already owned, just as happens if you go to buy one of these bundles for your own account. For one friend, I'd be playing somewhere in the region of £87 for the bits required to totally drown them in rads, while another would set me back only £71. That is, of course still wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much to pay to make sure someone owns both Fallout Tactics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s extra fishing gear, but hey, maybe next time the sale rolls around.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a handy feature for Steam to offer. Not being able to dump all of the Yakuza/Like A Dragons on your mum at Christmas, alongside an email linking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">this article</a> ain't right. Now, to wait a full year for the opportunity to do it.</p><p>In other recent Steam-related news, Valve have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-no-longer-earn-steam-points-from-community-awards-as-valve-try-to-kill-off-clownface-farming">revamped their community award emojis</a> in an effort to stop people deliberately writing anger-inducing and clown sticker-attracting posts in order to earn Steam points they can spend on fancy profile backgrounds. I'm sure it'll work and I'll soon be able to read a discussion thread or review section without the risk of rolling my eyes so hard they plop out onto my desk.</p>
