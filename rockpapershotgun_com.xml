            <p>Two days before launch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has its PC <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pc-specs-and-features/">system requirements</a>. They’re generally on the higher side without teetering over into full-on tech demo lunacy – the RTX 2070 is a minimum-spec <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a>, for instance – though anyone with a smaller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> will need to make room for the looty FPS sequel’s bumper-size 100GB storage requirement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, gargantuan install sizes are kind of obnoxious (even the infamously bloated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">Call of Duty agrees</a>), and are partly caused by merely visual, high-resolution textures that we increasingly need madly expensive GPUs to even enable. Or at least, to enable without simultaneously committing framerateicide.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 100 is a very round and satisfying number. Just look at it. Way better than 112 or some garbage. I do wonder if anyone working in Gearbox’s gigabyte dieting department saw it was possible to compress it down to 99GB, potentially avoiding the shock of entering the triple digits, but left it at 100GB just because it’s vaguely <em>nicer</em>. I suspect I’d do the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s the hardware:</p>
<h3>Borderlands 4 minimum PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 / 11</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 core minimum)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580 (8GB minimum)</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100GB (SSD required)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Borderlands 4 recommended PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 / Windows 11</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100GB (SSD required)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solid state hungriness aside, it’s a bit strange seeing the Arc B580 in the recommended tier, alongside the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT – it’s a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-b580-review">good little budget card</a> but not on the same level as those two older, yet bonafide high-end GPUs. Though maybe that means Borderlands 4 performs better-than-recommended on this Nvidia/AMD kit?</p><p>Also, 2K’s post doesn’t mention it specifically, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> is supported as well. This needs a GeForce RTX 50 series card to operate at full pelt, with RTX 40 models making do with DLSS 3-style 2x frame gen.</p>
<p>I’m generally in the 'wait and see how it is' camp on Fourderlands, with its new planet and its many billions of randomly generated firearms, having previously been interested enough to mulch through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> with mates but jointly concluding it wasn’t worth our time. This new one is something of a reset, with its lead writer Taylor Clark claiming it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won’t have as many jokes</a>. Which is, at once, likely an improvement and also a weird thing to make a selling point of. B4's out on September 12th.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have announced plans to roll out a policy which will mandate that staff return to working from the office at least three days per week, with a first phase of it set to come into force as of February 2026.</p>
<p>In a memo about the move shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">The Verge</a>, Microsoft executive vice president and chief people officer Amy Coleman asserted that it's "not about reducing headcount". The mandate comes just a couple of months after the company's mass layoffs which saw about 9,000 employees let go and several games cancelled. The bloodletting hasn't stopped since that point either, with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-layoffs-continue-into-5th-consecutive-month/">The Seattle Times</a> reporting this week that Microsoft have laid off a further 42 employees, bringing the total to 15,000 since May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive — they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results," Coleman wrote in the memo about the proposed return to office. "As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together. With that in mind, we’re updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office." The Verge report that some teams at Microsoft might be expected to work from the office four or five days a week, and that some roles like consulting will be exempt.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to read that the RTO mandate reflects the company's wider plans for generative AI. Microsoft have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">shovelling billions of dollars into AI tech</a> over the course of this year, a move that definitely doesn't have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/23/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst-and-send-the-stock-market-into-freefall">the potential to end terribly</a> pretty soon. Back in July, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">spoke of the need</a> for a "messy" organisational transformation to carry out Microsoft's aims for genAI, while talking around the "incongruence" between the company's vast profits and mass layoffs.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren cites some Microsoft staff he spoke to last month as having agreed that this return to office mandate could be seen as a form of 'soft' or 'stealth' layoffs. This is something companies instituting return to office mandates have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">accused of</a> for a number of years now, with the logic being that in rescinding the option of full-time remote work, these businesses are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandates-layoffs-quit-jobs-hybrid-remote-work-office-2025-5">making an effort to push certain staff towards leaving voluntarily</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you're a worker facing a lengthy commute, a move to a different place in order to be able to go into the office while maintaining a decent work/life balance, or have a disability/condition and aren't able to secure an exception, the word 'voluntarily' might be doing some heavy lifting there. Microsoft staff will reportedly be able to apply for an exception to this mandate by September 19th.</p>
<p>Clearly aiming to get out ahead of any accusations along those lines, Coleman wrote in her memo: "Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It’s about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers’ needs."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Communication Workers of America union, which have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">helped organise several of the unions that've been formed at game studios under the Microsoft/Xbox banner in recent years</a>, for comment.</p>
<p>The proposed first phase of Microsoft's proposed return to office mandate is set to only affect staff who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington. The second and third phases set to follow with "other US locations" and then staff outside the US further down the line.</p>
<p>Aside from the job cuts, Microsoft have also recently faced protests over their links to the Israeli government, something you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">read more about in this feature from Edwin</a>.</p>

            <p>
In my experience, there are two kinds of tank in Battlefield games. There are the ones driven by other people, which are cut from solid granite yet move like ballet dancers. And then there are the ones driven by me, which are made out of candy floss and handle like shopping trolleys. Possibly, this reflects some kind of underlying "skill issue", but come now, that's speculative reporting that flies in the face of logic. <em>Clearly</em> it's a balancing issue. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> lead producer David Sirland with a little more, based on learnings during the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games%22%22">shooter</a>'s multiplayer beta.
</p>
<p>
You may have found that the tanks, helicopters, jeeps and jets on show in said Battlefield 6 beta were somewhat squishy, versus the hardiness of infantry and especially, engineers equipped with anti-tank mines and rockets. Responding to an aggrieved Xitter post (as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-producer-acknowledges-vehicles-were-underpowered-in-the-beta-but-says-its-better-than-the-alternative-rather-have-too-weak-vehicles-over-too-powerful/">PCGamer</a>), Sirland acknowledged that there's a balancing issue here, but also, suggested that developers DICE, Ripple, Motive and Criterion may have lowballed the rides to begin with, in order to set a good foundation.
</p>
<p>
"That is a balance issue wholesale, not specific to this special situation however," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1965413764414718144">wrote</a>, when one user complained about the potency of said engineers and their dastardly munitions. "And one we are actively working on. Rather have too weak vehicles over too powerful to start. Its a tricky one as players get better at using them over time as well."
</p>
<p>
I find this both funny and interesting. Funny because Battlefield 6 has made a drinking game out of slaughtering vehicles in trailers: those choppers certainly don't seem fit for much besides blowing up. And interesting because it's a quick glimpse into the ever-gripping intricacies of game balancing.</p><p>There is arguably no such thing as "good balance" inasmuch as balancing is an on-going process - developers have to keep adjusting the mixture to keep up with the ingenuity and quirks of clashing groups of players, while hazily targeting some kind of optimal all-round experience. Sirland's aside has made me consider the prospect that developers might deliberately ship a game they consider 'unbalanced' because they're trying to anticipate how player behaviour might evolve. They're trying to balance for how people will be playing in a few month's time, perhaps. A fearful gamble, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Add these insights to EA's longer, official account of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">how they're changing Battlefield 6 based on the beta playtest</a>. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-persistent-servers-and-two-vehicle-heavy-maps-are-coming-in-the-next-labs-playtest">vehicle-heavy maps coming in future Battlefield Labs playtests</a>, so we can get another sense of the curiously variable sponginess of those tanks, which assuredly has nothing to do with the steadiness of my thumbs.</p>
<p>The final game will release on October 10th. The single player story sees the US army trying to save NATO from a rogue PMC, which I think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-make-the-usa-the-villain-in-the-next-call-of-duty-or-battlefield-game">a bit daft</a> given the current US administration's foreign policies.
