            <p>You might have seen a new name around the homepage this past week: Mark Warren. It might also be that you recognise the name if you're a reader of RPS sibling site VG247, where Mark has already been plying his trade for several years. Well, we've adopted Mark here at RPS, as one might adopt a puppy if the puppy really liked mods, RPGs and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Come say hello in the comments.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Mark joined VG247 back in 2023, and since then he's written news, features and reviews that would have all sat comfortably on our own pages. He's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-sims-4-25-anniversary-house-build-existential-dread">had a breakdown about his lack of interior design skills in The Sims</a>, braved <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-tv-show-fallout-community-feature">talking to the Fallout community</a>, interviewed developers behind one of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/summer-eternal-studio-ex-disco-elysium-expectations-interview">the half-dozen Disco Elysium spiritual successors</a>, and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mlb-the-show-24-extra-seinfeld-series-we-never-knew-we-needed">built a baseball team made entirely of George Costanzas</a>. He's also, yeah, written a lot about Helldivers 2, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">posts</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">for us</a> this week alone, so you know he's not afraid to follow through on his passions.
</p>
<p>It's been an odd year for RPS, with more departures than arrivals. We continue to work to hire a new reviews editor, too. In the meantime, I'm glad that Mark is bringing his expertise to the site. Please give him a warm welcome below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s bird-bodied Guardian have a human face hidden somewhere on his feathery body? It's a question people have been thinking about, and by "people" I mean a small subset of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> obsessives who like to watch the game being picked apart 3D model by 3D model.</p>
<p>Thanks to a prolific Souls modder/dataminer, I can provide you with an answer. In their latest video, Zullie The Witch - who's previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-727">solved various Souls mysteries</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-are-modding-armored-cores-into-elden-ring-and-now-i-want-a-souls-game-where-you-play-a-giant">modded an Armored Core</a> into Elden Ring - has unmasked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s crop of nightfarers like they're Scooby-Doo villians. Most of their faces look how you'd expect, but there are a couple of noteworthy cases that I think it's worth you knowing about.</p>

<p>First of all, it's worth noting that due to the switch from custom characters to eight established archetypes, Nightreign's playable characters don't use facedata - by my understanding, this the character creator values that spit out a specfic face - in the same way Elden Ring did, though Zullie does note: "there is technically facedata in Nightreign, but it seems to be just a copy of the existing data from Elden Ring."</p>
<p>With that established, I'm gonna jump to the bit of the video that discusses the Guardian, the game's halberd-wielding Pinionfolk captain. Some folks had been wondering if his birdy visage might have mean FromSoft having to hide a human face somewhere on his model, presumably so he'd conform with the rest of the playable models. Thankfully for all of our dreams, Zullie has checked under the backs of their knees for stray mouths, and says they've not found a weird human face hiding anywhere on the Guardian.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only nightfarer they couldn't find any kind of proper face for (of the human or birdy variety) was Wylder. Removing the armour from each of his skins has just revealed a featureless "silhoutte", which Zullie notes leaves his appearance a bit of mystery, though folks have inferred that he likely looks similar to the Dutchess. Cue some commenters joking that of course the character they've dubbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4dhbq/john_nightreign/">John Nightreign</a>, similarly to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players making a meme out of the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b3pmx5/who_is_john_helldiver/">John Helldiver</a> referring to some legendary everyman figure, is faceless.</p>
<p>One asserted that this confirms that "Wylder is the true John from all Fromsoft games", which is certainly a theory.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a> and the stuff FromSoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">recently confirmed</a> is coming to it down the road.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> is currently free to keep on Steam until June 8, but its recent reviews are mostly negative due to an ongoing review bombing from players concerned about its terms of service.</p>
<p>This follows an earlier upset among Borderlands likers because of Gearbox exec and unstoppable poster of words Randy Pitchford, who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">said a rather inconsiderate thing</a> about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>’s pricing and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">said some slightly less inconsiderate things</a> about Borderlands 4’s pricing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you go to claim the game for zero pounds and zero pence ahead of the offer expiring on Sunday, you’ll notice that while the total number of reviews it’s racked up since release in 2012 have left it sitting at “very positive”. That’s in spite of the past month or so, which has seen it accrue this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/#app_reviews_hash">barrage of negative verdicts</a> that’s gotten more intense since this announcement of it going free.</p>
<p>It’s attracted 1980 thumbs downs just over the course of June 5 and June 6 as of writing, in comparison to just 280 positive reviews in the same timespan. The vast majority of these recent negative reviews cite an update to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com//eula/49520_eula_0">Take-Two's terms of service</a> on February 28 this year as their reason for unhappiness, with many accusing the publisher and 2K of pushing “spyware”.</p>
<p>This looks to be the continuation of a review bombing movement that the game’s review graph suggests really kicked into motion in May, stemming from concerns over a recent 2K change to Borderlands 2’s Ts and Cs. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">PC Gamer</a> reports that a YouTube video released by Borderlands content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@0fficalHellfire">Hellfire</a> may have been where things started.</p>
<p>Those doing the review bombing, which has also hit other games in the series like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397540/Borderlands_3/">Borderlands 3</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/vcxzvxzcvxczadsadsqw/recommended/49520/">are citing</a> the types of data the revamped EULA collects about players, as well as a clause in its “Code of Conduct” section they believe unfairly targets mods and cheats.</p>
<p>That clause reads as follows: “You will not use exploits or illegal or unauthorised means to interfere with or adversely impact any other user’s ability to use the services as intended; to gain unfair gameplay advantage; or to gain access to virtual items or other content to which you do not have valid entitlement. This includes the use of cheats or so-called ‘mod menus’, unauthorised mods, hacks, glitches, or any other technical exploits, and phishing, scamming, or social engineering.”</p>
<p>So, something that could maybe affect modders generally - not that prominent Borderlands modders <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1930688158204616891">seem concerned</a> - but sounds to me more like fairly typical EULA stuff designed specifically to discourage the use of mods or cheats online, where they could affect the experience had by other players. You know, like the checks fellow Take-Two-owned GTA Online developers Rockstar have tried to institute to stop your session being ambushed by invincible gods who fly around magically giving everyone vast sums of free money.</p>
