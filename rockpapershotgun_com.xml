            <p>Game development can be stressful, I'm sure you've heard. The director of fighting game series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken">Tekken</a> yesterday shared an anecdote about how wild that stress can get. Speaking about the release of Tekken 4 in 2001, director Katsuhiro Harada remembered it didn't perform as well as previous games. And the game's relatively weak reception (alongside a lack of support at Bandai Namco) sent his body into a spiral of ill-health from anxiety. </p>
<p>"I was under so much stress at the time that I developed a mysterious condition where all the hair on the right side of my body fell out - just the right side," said the director in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1904208862754038011">a post on Xitter</a>. "Even the hair on my arms, eyebrows, and eyelashes disappeared."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If it sounds unusual that hair loss might affect only one side of the body, it's not actually that uncommon for balding to occur on one side before the other. Conditions like <a href="https://www.bad.org.uk/pils/alopecia-areata/">alopecia areata</a> can be activated from stress and cause hair loss from eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial hair. It's basically an immune system response - your body feels under threat and goes into overdrive, attacking and inflaming even its own hair follicles. Of course, I don't know if this is what was going on with Harada's body at the time - I was in school, ignoring the maths teacher. But the developer is convinced that work pressures definitely caused the problem.</p>
<p>"Actually, there was a period - just for about a year before development on Tekken 5 began - when I left Namco due to the stress and shock. It’s not a widely known fact, though," continued Harada in the post, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-producer-katsuhiro-harada-opens-up-about-the-severe-side-effects-of-stress-he-experienced-while-developing-tekken-4/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>The developer made the comments after a random follower praised Tekken 4 for being "the most authentic and adult Tekken ever released". Praise which Harada notes is only offered with hindsight.</p>
<p>"But back then, I was absolutely bombarded with criticism," he said. "I didn’t have a single ally. Not one. That’s a well-known story inside the company.</p>
<p>"Now, in the present day, the critics have all forgotten their complaints, and only those who want to praise the game remain. That’s the only reason it's being treated like a masterpiece. For me, whether good or bad, this title remains a constant reminder and lesson to myself."</p>
<p>Years later, we're now sitting pretty on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and Harada remains the director of the series. Did you know he once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tekken-director-failed-to-get-kfcs-colonel-sanders-in-the-fighting-game-but-here-are-10-other-corporate-mascots-he-could-try">tried to convince KFC to let him put Colonel Sanders in the fighting game</a>? Anyway, the latest entry is pretty swell according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, although I'm still waiting for my favourite characters to join the party. Most recently we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annoying-little-sister-anna-williams-is-coming-to-tekken-8-in-second-season-of-dlc">seen Anna Williams appear</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-fighter-is-clive-actually">guest character Clive</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Every time Lei Wulong is left on the bench, I weep a single tear. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/canabalt">Canabalt</a> developer and Tunic publisher Adam “Atomic” Saltsman has released a free “mash-up” of Wolfenstein and the original Prince Of Persia. It runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a>, the sprinkle-covered fairy cake of game engines, and comprises 15 levels of jumping over gaps and murdering Nazis. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike in the original Prince Of Persia, each screen shows you the full level with a fog of war effect. This pleases me, because the act of moving between screens in OG POP used to fill me with terror, at least till I memorised the map. Remember the first time you felt the ground give way and fell on some spikes in Prince Of Persia? At least when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> ran out of air you got a countdown. Eesh.
</p>
<p>
You can find Prince Of Prussia – not bad as puns go, but I feel like there's an absolute banger here waiting to be discovered - on <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/prince">Itch.io</a>. There are at least 60 Nazis to slaughter. Both the PICO-8 action buttons are used for jumping. Rather than engaging in a clash of scimitars, you kill the Nazis simply by walking into them from behind once you’ve found yourself a knife. 
</p>
<p>
Saltsman has <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/">made a few things for Itch</a>, ranging from free tilesets to moderately leftfield sokobans and “bandit accountancy” games. All good stuff, but nothing rivals leaping through that window in Canabalt.

            <p>If there's one thing I know about you sickos it's that you love a good city builder. No, don't try to deny it. I have the site traffic data right here and the numbers do not lie (unless they make me look bad to people who outrank me). You people are never happier than when you're wallowing in a bathtub full of upgradeable cottages, taxation sliders and pop satisfaction metrics. It's a disgraceful habit, but I'm not here to judge - not when there's a Steam City Builder &amp; Colony Sim Fest underway.</p><!--more-->
<p>Valve's latest jumpstarting of consumerism's flagging heartbeat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_cities_settlements/?facets40307=12%3A0_2&amp;flavor=popularpurchaseddiscounted&amp;offset=48">runs from now till 31st March</a>, so there's plenty of time to look through the catalogue and its many exotic variations of "city". Town-builders? But of course there are town-builders. Pyramid-builders? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101280/The_Pyraplex/">Sure, why not</a>. Mushroom-builders? OK, I can see you've been working too hard... wait! There <em>is</em> a mushroom-builder. It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521550/Shroomchitect/">Shroomchitect</a> and it's currently roundabouts the price of two, maybe three high street sausage rolls. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In terms of discounts on well-received games, you can get Klei's banging asteroid colony builder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxygen-not-included">Oxygen Not Included</a>, coal-fired dystopia-me-do <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and cutaway 2D skyscraper management sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-highrise">Project Highrise</a> for less than a tenner each. If you're up for risking some sofa change on a relative unknown, the same or less money will get you eco-minded neighbour cultivator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blockhood">Block'hood</a>, the oddball, ramshackle <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945740/Buildings_Have_Feelings_Too/">Buildings Have Feelings Too</a>, and the mystical nomad fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-far-as-the-eye">As Far As The Eye</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you spot any gems going for the price of two, possibly three high street sausage rolls. I confess, I like building cities myself, though it's a genre I seldom find time for because my attention span has been smashed to pieces by daily newswriting. If you know of any building sims that are especially easy to resume playing after long absences, I'd appreciate a recommendation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
