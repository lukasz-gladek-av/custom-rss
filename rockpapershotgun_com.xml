            <p>
I'm not sure I've seen people swing back and forth on a game so rapidly like they have with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. It's had a few hiccoughs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">there</a>, which has made for some tough times for developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a>, at least in terms of battling the accursed "mixed" rating on Steam (and lower). In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani quite accurately noted that it's been "one heck of a roller coaster year" for Helldivers 2, and also went on to speak about what it was like clawing its way back from low ratings - all the while having to explain to Sony about summer holidays in Sweden.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As Jorjani noted, at one point in time Helldivers 2 went as low as 30% positive on Steam, which as he says, "usually that's the death knell for a game, but we came back from that." The bigger problem came after some balancing tweaks which brought it down to 19%. "I think [19%] was the lowest. Games that get 19% user score do not generally recover." 
</p>
<p>
Except, at that point, everybody was on vacation. "When I was asked to step in [as CEO], they gave me the keys to the car… and told me: ‘we're going off on vacation, because we haven't been taking much over the last few summers,'" Jorjani explains. "And I was like: ‘we're running a live service game, people can't be off for the next three months!’ But that's what happens in Sweden. We take our summer vacations very seriously."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had to explain this to SIE Studio Business Group CEO too, not exactly an easy task - "maybe the lowest point during my tenure so far" as the Arrowhead CEO put it - but a plan was formed, and reviews have swung back around to positive. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jorjani said he was "inspired" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, perhaps one of the most infamous games of the past decade when it comes to changing the rhetoric surrounding it. "The game was hyped, then bombed, and then they put the head to the grindstone and just updated the game," Jorjani noted.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Hello Games had a lot more work to do to right that spaceship, it took years to get it to where it's at now. The response to Helldivers 2 has certainly been a lot more volatile, and one could pretty easily argue that that fact speaks to where we're at with live service games: kick up enough of a fuss, and you'll more or less get what you want. In any case, fingers crossed for Arrowhead that Helldivers 2's second year goes a bit smoother.

            <p>
Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-is-in-early-development-shows-powerful-new-creative-tools">when Project Rene was first announced</a>, everyone quite fairly assumed that it would go on to become <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 5, given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> was quite old by that point. Then, last year, EA actually said no, they're not making a Sims 5, they're just going to keep making things for The Sims 4, and Project Rene will be more of a multiplayer game. While bits and pieces of the game have been shared here and there, some gameplay of Project Rene now appears to have been shared online, which looks like it very much wasn't meant to be seen by many eyes.
</p>

<p>
Now, to be clear, the game hasn't technically been labelled as a Sims game. On the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;gl=ph">Google Play Store</a> it's been listed as City Life Game with Friends. It is from EA's official account though, and your character both has one of those classic plumbobs, is referred to as a Sim, and speaks Simlish throughout the gameplay footage (which you can check out below).

<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that the leaked footage in question is obviously from quite an early build of the game. It certainly looks functional, but to be honest, it also looks a bit dull. You can see what appears to be other players walking around, and <a href="https://youtu.be/1S38bOIsuWo?si=Bfwrz0Je0QZm8Wks">other footage</a> appears to show that you have the ability to chat over text or voice, but from the various clips shared online, right now it doesn't appear like there's meaningful ways to interact with anyone else.
</p>
<p>
Another clip shows that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE&amp;ab_channel=GamingMobile">create your own cafe</a>, but it looks like more of a challenge than the usual casual approach to building, with a timer counting you down. You also seem to be playing as one, specific Sim rather than acting as a benevolent/ unkind god over all Sims, which doesn't really feel like it taps into the appeal of a series.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's clearly early days for Project Rene, I mean, City Life Game with Friends, I just can't help but wonder if this is a future <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> 2013 level disaster waiting to happen. Sims with multiplayer doesn't sound awful in concept, though the proof will be in the pudding.
