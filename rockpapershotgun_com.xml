Not the kind that swoop and screech and dive around your car in New Games Journalism articles that lean a bit too obviously on Hunter S. Thompson - bless our hearts, we've all done it - but the kind who labour at the forge and rejoice when their colleagues crumble and may even drive other workers out in order to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think I prefer the Fear and Loathing variety. Anyway, here's the trailer for Against the Storm's second DLC expansion, Nightwatchers, which will release on PC via Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store on July 31st.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The Bats despise weakness and tend to thrive where others fail, making them unique but volatile companions on an expedition into the wilderness," says a press release of the new DLC faction. "Their Manorial Court ability is used to expel a member of another species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate the rest of the workforce. They also gain resolve when other species leave the settlement." </p>
<p>While the bats may not make for great neighbours, publishers Hooded Horse and developers Eremite Games claim they'll stand you in good stead when exploring the DLC's two new biomes. The Rocky Ravine is a treeless waste where you'll find a lot of metal and stone, plus "merciless merchants who won't think twice about exploiting you for their gain". There's a new Black Market to exploit here, defined by "highly volatile prices and goods availability, all hidden from the watchful eyes of the Scorched Queen."</p>
<p>The second biome is Bamboo Flats, a place of heavy precipitation in at least two senses. "Though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of any fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to enrich the soil and help establish a flourishing settlement, provided it's well taken care of," the developers explain. "Manage its hunger, thirst, and warmth to reap rewards." OK, this sounds like the more interesting part of the DLC, actually: keep Rodan happy so that it'll shit on you regularly enough to hold starvation at bay.</p>
<p>The DLC will also include new orders, world events, rewards, and music. It will accompany the game's 1.8 update, which introduces a new Smouldering City upgrade, a legendary cornerstone and various other bits and pieces, none of them as instantly compelling as the prospect of founding a colony on birdpoop. I wonder if the bats feel happier when they're being crapped on - it seems like the kind of rough living they'd enjoy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/top-city-builder-against-the-storm-gets-a-grumpy-bat-faction-and-giant-pooping-birds-in-its-next-dlc-this-july]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Big piratey thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> will be getting custom servers as part of a paid subscription service in "early 2026", developers Rare have announced during a first-ever community direct for the game. That's far from all of the studio's plans, with wider shakeups also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This outlining of plans to make sure the good ship SOT is not only seaworthy, but can successfully broadside the many other vessels competing for its players' attention comes with some depressing and un-piratey context. It follows Rare being one of the studios affected by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> being among the number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">in-development games cancelled</a> as part of the cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the hour-ish of their community direct and accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves_2025_Edition/">Steam blog post</a>, Rare acknowledged that they've got some work to do to keep folks invested in the game. "We know we haven’t hit the mark our players were hoping for in terms of game health and performance, especially when it comes to being reactive to cheating and the game experience on PC," they wrote, "We’re also cognisant that we could be more attuned to the desires and experiences of our player base, and we’ll be working hard to remedy this in future."</p>
<p>Cue some changes to how the teams working on SOT are structured, with Rare saying it's expended the team focused on "improving the core playability and stability of the main game". Alongside this, the studio's taking a different approach to how they structure three-month seasons, with new stuff arriving every month so the players always have something fresh to do.</p>

<p>While seasons 17 and 18, both of which were teased here, are coming soon, those custom servers will be arriving early next year. They'll be deployed as part of a new subscription's "premium package", which'll also include other benefits. You'll be able to tweak the seas of your custome server to suit your every whim, spawning enemies, turning off enemies, running safer seas fleets, messing about with the devs' cinematic camera. The place oysters come from is your oyster.</p>
<p>"Although this subscription service is landing next year, we’ve taken the decision to announce it nice and early so that our Partners and creative communities can start making plans sooner rather than later," Rare wrote, "We want to build this toolset in partnership with the community, and running it as a subscription model means that we can ensure ongoing investment into and development of custom servers as a platform."</p>
<p>So, there you go. Sea of Thieves is sailing on. Hoist the mainsail.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-thieves-is-getting-paid-custom-servers-next-year-and-rare-are-switching-up-their-approach-to-seasons]]></content:encoded>

The game's latest trailer is a brief glimpse at the new breeding features, which allow you "to synthesise male and female variants, each with visible dimorphism" and have them do the ole horizontal tango "to shape the traits and markings of future generations."

<p>The intricacies of dino-bonking appear largely in line with bake-the-potato mechanics in similar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management games. You will need to construct and place a nest at a tasteful remove from visitors, with comfort levels sufficient to set the mood for the species in question. Dinosaurs have a fertility level that varies according to age, health, and how recently they've roasted the broomstick. From the looks of it, when they're up for some slophockey they'll go perch on the nest and do saucy toodle-oo noises. Then you just need to find or flash-grow an appropriate mate, and assign a boffin to officiate the Chesterfield rugby. </p>
<p>The result will be an individual with a particular combination of genes and traits, such as faster growth, greater aggression and a need for more living space. As is generally the case in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>, you may come to regret letting your terrible lizards have kids. "While fascinating for park guests to behold, introducing juveniles also brings new challenges thanks to their unique social needs, as well as changes to the wider herd dynamic," the developers caution in a press release.</p>
<p>It's hard to get much sense of the possibilities from 90-odd seconds of very restrained and managerial T-reXXX footage, but the hope, of course, is that the system will lead to sudden overpopulation punctuated by a few total genetic disasters. I want to turn my back for five minutes and discover that the triceratops have become the equivalent of parakeets in London, and that all of the young velociraptors are vegetarians. Going by the developer's prior work, I don't think it'll be quite that adventurous, but, as Geoff Goldblum likes to say, life finds a method.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-breeding-trailer-explains-the-fine-art-of-dinosaur-bonestorming]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom are fine-tuning the live service of livestock-murdering game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> by making the Arch-tempered monster hunts a permanent fixture, rather than time-limited seasonal content quests. It's a bid to address the FOMO element that has dragged the game down to an Overwhelmingly Negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam user review consensus</a>, though there are other things to blame for that, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">dodgy performance</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>One Arch-tempered munster, Rey Dau, will return on July 23rd, after the currently available event quest ends on July 16th. (If you're unfamiliar, Rey Dau is a big golden Tesla dragon.) Arch-tempered Uth Duna will debut on the same date, a week ahead of schedule. (If you've yet to have the pleasure, Uth Duna is a flouncy alligator that loves to sneeze on itself.)</p>
<p>These may not be the first permanently available Arch-tempered monsters. "We are considering making the event quests for the upcoming Arch-tempered monsters and other event quests permanently available as well," Capcom comment via <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1943582546886889868">MechaHitler.com</a>. More details are to follow.</p>
<p>Going by the responses to this announcement, I gather that the limited-time quests in Monster Hunter Wilds have been causing a lot of ruckus. Some players object that the previous major series iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak">Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</a>, did not have these stressful features, while others point out that they were present in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, the last game from the Wilds team specifically.</p>
<p>My only, rather disingenuous thought here is that it's a bit rich for so-called "hunters" to be complaining of FOMO. Hunting is supposed to be about identifying and accommodating the prey animal's schedule, isn't it? Pretty dang sure the pre-Neolithic tribes weren't out there review-bombing the skygods because the herds kept moving south for the winter. Actually, that probably explains the formation of many organised religions.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered just not telling people when Arch-tempered monsters are present in the game. Foster the element of curiosity! I'm sure that would in no way increase the quantity of hatemail they're receiving. Capcom have recently <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">put out a statement</a> addressing the harassment of staff, which has been widely interpreted as a response to the ruckus over Monster Hunter Wilds.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo]]></content:encoded>
