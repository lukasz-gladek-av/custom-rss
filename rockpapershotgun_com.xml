            <p>Now we're cooking with asbestos: Warhammer Skulls, the yearly power armoured excite-o-thon hosted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Boltgun</a> actor Rahul Kohli, returns this Thursday. It's traditionally a time of reveals and revelry, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus">Mechanicus</a> sequel a likely contender for the spotlight this year. You can watch it live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer">TwitchHam</a> at  17:00 BST/12:00 EST/9:00 PST. Here's a teasytrailyhypeyshouty in the meantime.</p>

<p>There'll also be discounts on a bunch of Warhammer licensed electronic entertainment products. There likely will not be any news on the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC, because Creative Assembly like to keep to their own inscrutable schedule. And, if certain conspiratorial corners of the internet and also <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dawn-of-war-4-linkedin-post/">The Gamer</a> are to be believed, we might also see something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Dawn Of War</a> shaped.</p>
<p>These rumours have bubbled up from LinkedIn; fetid swamplands where drowning souls beg the local alligators for a swift crunchdeath but are instead tortured with bullet pointed posts by self-styled analysts using 500 of their businessiest words to say "game sold well because fun, also no woke, share if agree" (I really need to get off LinkedIn). Specifically, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8">a post by</a> one Dominik Dolenec, whose UK based investment firm Emona Capital includes both Relic and Blackbird Interactive in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Dolenec shared a picture of himself at Nottingham's Warhammer World, thanking Owen Rees - Games Workshop's head of licensing and project lead on multiple Dawn Of War titles. "Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come,” wrote Dolenec. From The Gamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is this post suggesting Dawn of War 4, rather than a Baneblade deconstructing game from Hardspace: Shipbreaker devs Blackbird Interactive? That all comes down to Dolenec’s t-shirt, which appears in the corner of one of his photos. It appears to bear the logo of Relic Entertainment, suggesting that he’s in Nottingham on its behalf. He also confirms that we’re not seeing things in the comments and he is, in fact, emblazoned with Relic’s crest.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there's your grist, rumour millers. Do with it what you will. Me? I don't especially need another Warhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> in my life that doesn't have Skaven in it, and I'm not entirely sure I trust modern Relic to deliver a decent one even if I did. I would play it though of course, yeah. Who do you think I am, someone who hasn't bought every Killteam big box this season despite not having assembled the Vespids from the starter yet?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
