            <p>As a few of you might know, each Sunday at 4pm GMT I run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a> - a regular chat with a selection of cool industry folks about what they're reading, what they're hoping to read next, and what books they recommend. The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It's a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-nightingale-absolver-and-total-war-warhammer-writer-dan-griliopoulos"> was Dan Griliopoulos</a>, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">was Warren Spector back in November</a>, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I'd had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Hey, so if you recall I reserved the right to change my mind about anything on my “what I’m going to read next” list for your Bookshelf column," Spector emailed me last night. "Well I changed my mind completely and thought it might be fun and interesting to do an update. Feel free to ignore this, but here’s what I was thinking."</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm not going to ignore Warren Spector. I figured an update to the original post would just get buried, so here it is in full. "Is this just promotion for your bloody column, Nic?", you may ask. Au contraire, my little faithless banana bread tin. Is it promotion for <em>literature itself</em>. Cheers again to Warren.</p>
<blockquote><p>So in my recent entry in this website’s Bookshelves column I listed a bunch of books I was considering reading next. I did the logical thing and listed the books that were next to my reading chair or at the top of my Kindle library, but I reserved the right to change my mind. Good thing I did because, boy, did I change my mind!</p>
<p>I've done some interesting reading recently that I wanted to share. None of which had <em>anything</em> to do with the books I thought I was going to read. I’m not talking about <em>a</em> book, but several unrelated books that turned <em>out</em> to be related and are richer when read together than when read separately. All are exceptionally well-written. I strongly recommend each of them, but especially if you read all of them back-to-back. That’s a genuinely special experience. Or was for me anyway.</p>
<p>First, New York In The Fifties by Dan Wakefield. It's a history of the intellectual and creative history of the city from the late-Forties through the early-Sixties, mostly around Columbia University and Greenwich Village (West and East). The author was like the Zelig character in Woody Allen's movie. He knew the Columbia intellectuals, the Esquire and New Yorker writers, the Village Voice founders, the Beats, a ton of musicians, people caught up in the blacklist, C. Wright Mills, Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, Thomas Pynchon, Bob Dylan and more.</p>
<p>But then there's book number 2 -- Three Shades Of Blue by James Kaplan. It's the story of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans (with lots about Charlie Parker, too) during the SAME PERIOD in the Village and mid-town (the jazz center of NYC). You get a completely different perspective on those years. It's fascinating. The author talks about specific songs and albums, all of which are streamable. I listened to the music he was talking about as I was reading, which enriched the experience greatly.</p>
<p>And THEN there's Positively 4th Street by David Hajdu, the story of the folk scene IN THE SAME PERIOD, also in the Village. It's mostly about Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Richard and Mimi Farina. Again, a different perspective on the period.</p>
<p>Next, I'm going to read a book called The Slip by Prudence Peiffer, about the art scene in the same place, same time. I anticipate that being fascinating for its perspective, too.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I learned is that ALL of these people hung out at a bar called The White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village -- ALL OF 'EM. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall!</p>
<p>Even if you're not interested in the time, place, or (seriously) the subject matter, the ways in which the books dovetail with one another makes for a fascinating reading journey. And you might just find yourself becoming interested in things you weren't interested in before.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am very happy to work at this website for many reasons, but high among them is game developers emailing me out of the blue at 8pm to passionately talk about the books they've read so I can share it to an audience of people that I'm 96% sure will mostly definitely give a shit. It makes me want to stay curious and excited and I hope you feel the same. Thank you again to Warren, and thank you to everyone who continues to read and comment on the column every week. As much as I'm always excited to speak to a new guest, some of my favourite times have been when I haven't been able to find anyone, but you've all still kept the conversation going with some great recommendations and thoughts. It feels like a very special and rare thing for a PC Gaming site and I plan to keep it going as long as possible.</p>
<p>Also, if you're a developer with a book habit please get in contact. I need new guests for the slate and I'm very lazy.</p>
<p>If you missed it, Spector is making a new immersive sim called Thick As Thieves with Greg LoPiccolo and David McDonough. They <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for RPS</a> about the project.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Oh, and one last thing..." teased the narration for yesterday's <a href="https://youtu.be/viAEO_cMqfU">Like A Dragon Direct</a> showcase on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, before announcing that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be getting New Game+ mode as part of a free post-launch update. It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> catching some backlash for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-seemingly-locks-new-game-behind-expensive-special-editions">decision to lock the mode</a> behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.</p>
<p>Unrelated, but I've decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.</p>

<p>The very talented scallywags at RGG also showed off some more of Majima's escapades, including his 'Mad Dog' and 'Sea Dog' fighting styles, making every pirate pun imaginable in the process. I mean, you'd have to. There will of course be ship customisation and crew gathering, and I especially like the look of 'Madlantis' - a seedy den of swashbucklers stuffed with minigames. Naturally, a lot of the other environments will be familiar to anyone who explored Infinite Wealth's Hawaii. I know I'm not alone in admiring RGG's approach to asset and location reuse, freeing them up to focus on quirkier additions, and also letting you get familiar with their virtual cities over the course of several games.</p><p>I was not personally affected by the decision to charge for New Game+ last time around, because the last thing I felt like doing after finishing 70 hours of Infinite Wealth was immediately playing another 70. Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Gaiden</a> entry, so it'll run shorter than the full-fat games - supposedly around 15 hours or so. I still thought it was a stinky choice, mind. Aside from new difficulty levels that effectively just made numbers go up, it was unambitious and uninteresting as far as NG+ modes go - 'unambitious' and 'uninteresting' being two words I usually wouldn't associate with the series at all. This one's out on the 21st of February.</p></div>

            <p>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">Video Games Chronicle</a><a></a>, and sure enough, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam page</a> for the "Remastered" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - "Account for PlayStation Network required". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The requirement for a PSN account to play certain games on PC became controversial after Sony tried to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">push the requirement</a> on players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, who were so miffed they review-bombed the game on Steam. In that case, the decision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">was overturned</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Sony has applied the mandatory account linking in an irregular way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">didn't require it</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God Of War Ragnarock</a> did. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> didn't make it mandatory, but tried to sweeten the deal by giving players bonus cosmetics for linking their Steam and PSN accounts. Now it looks like Sony are confident <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II Remastered</a> is big enough to cause only annoyed tuts when it comes to this requirement. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons this mandatory account smooshing annoys folks is that it means the game will not go on sale in certain countries where PSN doesn't operate for legal or business reasons. Insider Gaming have compiled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/">a list of countries</a> which don't have PSN. In Europe alone this list includes Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Moldova, Georgia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you live in any of these PSNless places, you basically can't play the affected game. This is despite the fact that many of these games are entirely single player. </p><p>As for the reasons behind it, well. Sony's chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki recently spoke about the requirement in an investor call, and said the account linking was done "so that anybody can enjoy the game safely" (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/sony-not-giving-up-on-its-psn-requirement-on-pc">as reported by VG247</a>). But this hardly explains it. The more likely reasoning comes down to digital rights management - they want players to be online so they can check if the game is a legal copy. And this has become such a dogmatic part of their legal and technical process that it now requires cutting off entire markets. It seems a stupid strategy to exclude entire countries of possible sales just to enforce a DRM policy, but corporations are cash-huffing monsters, and do not necessarily value the sales numbers - projected or real - in some nations. </p>
<p>All in all, another example of corporate interest making things worse for everyone, thanks to the arcane legalities and unseeable arithmetic of business. For more lumps of news, please keep reading our website. I promise some of the lumps are actually good. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
