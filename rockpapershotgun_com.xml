            <p>
Crossovers! Collabs! Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled "Tides of Terraria" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as "large", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. "The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518587145533786079">Steam post</a> about the update.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, so you can thank Mario for this one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-is-getting-a-closed-technical-test-letting-a-lucky-few-try-out-its-oddball-fps-stylings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is a bit of a departure from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy's</a> usual games, given that it's a three-player multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a>. The shooty bit is nothing new, that's pretty typical of Remedy's games, even if the shooting always has something slightly off about it. It's the multiplayer angle that sets it apart, and, funnily enough, the fact that Remedy don't always make shooting feel all that great, so it's left me curious as to how it actually plays. I'm assuming some of you feel the same way, and there's some sort of good news: you can sign-up to playtest it this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, big asterisk here. Remedy notes that "due to the limited capacity of this Closed Technical Test, a sign-up does not guarantee access," meaning I would like it if you don't leave a comment blaming me for getting you all excited. That's just the way these tests go, I don't make the rules! 
</p>
<p>
You might want to get yourself signed-up soon though, the test kicks off in a couple of days on May 15th at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 4pm EEST. It'll then run until May 19th, 1:59pm PDT / 4:59pm EDT / 9:59pm BST / 11:59pm EEST, so you'll have a good few days to try it out. The test will be available on PC, of course, as well as those strange things called "consoles" I've heard so much about, like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, and you can sign-up right <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If FBC: Firebreak has somehow flown under your radar, and if it's looking a bit familiar, that's because it's a spinoff of Control (the FBC in its name standing for Federal Bureau of Control). The game is set after the events of the original Control, meaning the Bureau is still having to deal with all the Hiss and weird nonsense that goes on there. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, but in Remedy's universe. A strong concept honestly!
</p>
<p>
Not long to go until it's out either, as the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-will-release-this-june">slated for a June 17th release</a>.
