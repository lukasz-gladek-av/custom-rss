            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which soundsâ€¦ pleasant.
</p>

<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.

I was quite pleasantly surprised when it was announced last year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-is-the-sequel-to-the-shopkeeping-dungeon-crawler-out-next-year">getting a sequel</a>. In that "oh, I never would have guessed this game would get one" kind of way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, as its full name goes, doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but during today's Triple-I showcase it did get a release window, which is the next best thing I suppose. It's a vague-ish window though, sometime this summer.
</p>

That's not too far away at least, given that by my understanding of the way the Northern Hemisphere works summer is the next season. Might be a bit awkward if developer Digital Sun were based in the Southern Hemisphere, but last I checked Spain was in the Northern one, so we should be good.

The new trailer showed off a pretty nice look at the game too, which is looking quite lovely. Obviously the first game was all pixel art, whereas this one's taking the 3D approach - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enter-the-dungeon-2-gets-a-reveal-almost-a-decade-on-from-the-first-one-looks-like-more-of-the-same-but-in-3d">seems to be a bit of a trend these days</a> - and I think it's been translated very well so far.
</p>
<p>
As before you'll be exploring dungeons, fighting baddies, and most importantly grabbing loot to bring back to your shop to hopefully sell on and make a fat wad of cash. You'll apparently be able to invest in the local village so that you can eventually get better weapons and things like that. Everything looks neat if you ask me!
</p>
<p>
Again, no exact release date, but whenever Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault arrives this summer, it'll do so as an early access release.
