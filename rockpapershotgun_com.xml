            <p>
I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doloc-town">Doloc Town</a> is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently.
</p>

<p>
Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here.

<p>
Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of Steam games, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/">launch discount on Steam</a> too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.

What do people that play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> call themselves, frostpunks? Feels too obvious, but I'm going to do it anyway. Breaking news frostpunks! There's a new big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> update that's just arrived in the game, adding some pretty big additions and changes,so let's jump into them. First up, The Pit! No, it's not just some hole to chuck things in, it's a large new map with a "distinctive 'proto-crater' pit counted as mountain terrain," to be found within.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The heating system has seen a big overhaul too. Described as the "biggest systemic change since launch", this one localises heat management to individual districts. Each district can apparently have "unique" effects, as well as consequences if you're failing to keep places warm. There's a new heatmap view too so you can see how each district is doing temperature.

Serenity mode from the first game is back with this update, a good one for frostpunks that don't like stress. There's gentler weather, way more resources, shorter whiteouts, and the fervour system is completely gone, meaning no conflict between factions and very few protests.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new challenges in-game too, all of which apparently introduce a "unique quest and storyline. Multiple Tales can be combined in a single playthrough. Complete a Tale to unlock a unique Monument Hub to “decorate” your city, but be careful: failure results in game over!"
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has received a few other tweaks to smooth things over as well, like a rebalanced prologue, improved tutorials, city visuals showing a denser population, alongside other changes. Modding tools are out of beta now, adding in features like a search bar, improved loading times, and tutorials.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/11-bit-studios">11 bit studios</a> go into a lot more detail about the minutiae changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498320947205373969?l=english">Steam post</a>, if you're looking for all the nitty gritty bits. There they also promised that alongside future DLC, they are "committed" to releasing more free big updates for Frostpunk 2, all while they work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-isnt-a-threequel-or-a-spin-off-but-a-remake-of-the-original">recently announced Frostpunk 1886</a>.
