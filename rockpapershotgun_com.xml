            <p>Open world crime blockbuster <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed until next year, say Rockstar, telling fans that they "need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve". It's not the biggest surprise - delays happen. But it's a slightly embarrassing announcement given that Strauss Zelnick, big boss of publisher Take-Two, has twice publicly reassured investors that the game would release on time in autumn this year. The announcement comes with some sense of relief, however, as Rockstar have now set a firm date in Spring.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026," say the studio in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a post on their website</a>. "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team."</p>
<p>It's the first time the developers have set a concrete day for the game's release. Previously they had only revealed a broad release window sometime this autumn - a vagueness that was causing some consternation in the industry, as various big games played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-launching-early-has-literally-0-to-do-with-gta-6s-release-date-marathon-or-anything-save-confidence-says-gearbox-boss">release date chicken</a> in an effort to avoid the ultraviolent giant. At least now other studios may breathe easy and make solid plans for their own games to release this autumn and winter. </p>
<p>Delays are normal in the industry, and the result is often a more polished game. We already knew as far back as March last year that Rockstar was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports"> considering a long delay as a "fallback plan"</a>, thanks to a report by Kotaku. So this was always a possibility. Jason Schreier of Bloomberg claims <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">it was inevitable</a>, according to his own sources at Rockstar.</p>

<p>Yet the delay is notable for being at odds with the publisher's past statements. Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, made various confident nods to money folks in shareholder conference calls, intimating that the game's upcoming release wouldn't slip. The boss was supposedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">"highly confident"</a> about the game's previous release window, according to his words in a meeting in 2024. Earlier this year, in another money-minded call, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">repeated those reassurances</a>. Later, Zelnick said that the company was staying quiet on an exact release date <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-other-game-devs-but-rockstar-is-still-keeping-quiet-about-a-release-date-in-the-name-of-maintaining-anticipation">to build "anticipation"</a>.</p><p>

"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI," said Zelnick in <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reiterates-expectations">a statement released today</a> by Take-Two. "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence... we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.‚Äù 

</p><p>Uh-huh. Anyway, there's still no PC release date for the game, sorry to say. And we only really have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-put-gta-6-trailer-live-early-after-leaks-across-social-media-confirms-2025-release-date">that one trailer</a> to go off so far. That might change this summer, as we in the press traipse slowly toward the territory of the Summer Games Fest, where we will be hacking down game announcement after game announcement with a machete of words in a dense jungle of trailers. The moment we spot a big video from Rockstar, we'll send word.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Survival hellscape <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> has added a tropical jungle biome to its procedurally generated maps, the biggest change to the landscape of the game in nine years. It'll appear close to where new players spawn and hides a number of threats and fun. Poisonous snakes will skitter through the undergrowth and riverside crocs will chew your face given the chance. There are ruins and temples hidden among the trees, housing some basic loot. And you can swing from vines, perhaps inspiring a whole new life in the canopy. Probably for the best, considering there are now tigers and panthers stalking the ground below.</p>

<p>Developers Facepunch detailed all the changes in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/498319683381887523">update post on Steam</a>. Maps are still procedurally generated (they've been this way since the nudist murder sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-new-version-review">moved to Unity 5 in 2016</a>) but until now maps have been basically a mix of arctic, temperate, and desert biomes. So this does seem a significant new addition to the deadly dog-eat-dog dangerzone. </p>
<p>To help out with that, there are two new weapons: a boomerang that returns to the player, and a blowpipe "for those who enjoy causing problems quietly." It can be loaded up with different types of dart ammo, including an "incapacitate" dart that slows its victims and obscures their vision for a time. Or a "radiation" dart that simply stacks radioactive ill-health onto your foe. Hideous behaviour, and not one bit surprising for Rust. The new wildlife sounds equally brutal. </p>

<p>"The tiger may be the deadliest animal you'll ever encounter [in] Rust," say the devs. "It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes."</p>
<p>To make sure that enemy's AI doesn't feel "unfair and bullshit," the animal will have a set of cues that you have to watch and listen for while roaming the fern-ridden floor. "It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals."</p>
<p>The overgrown temples (an ancient ziggurat, for example) will hide some mysteries, we're told. And slightly less weathered ruins will contain "low-tier supplies and maybe even a few surprises tucked away". The place is also a botanist's delight, from the sounds of things.</p>
<p>"The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage," they say. "This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as [a] variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from." </p>

<p>There's a bunch of other stuff accompanying the update (here's the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/jungle-update">full patch notes</a>), including beefing up of servers, and a DLC pack with an Aztec-flavoured AK-47. If only Moctezuma had had one of these... </p>
<p>I'm not going back to Rust, even with all this lush-looking leaf rendering. I haven't visited its randogen den of misdeeds in over a decade, when I chronicled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-diary">a nine-life misadventure</a> with its chaotic players. But even I can see the game has changed a huge amount since then, adding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-adds-boasts">boats</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-next-dlc-pack-adds-pools-tubes-and-water-guns">water pistols</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-has-submarines-spearguns-and-sharks-now">submarines</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-new-instruments-dlc-lets-you-shred-the-shovel-bass">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-now-has-npcs-who-can-give-you-missions">NPC quest-givers</a>, and even - oh my god - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-is-finally-adding-backpacks-to-kick-off-its-second-decade">backpacks</a>. No wonder it remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. If you're made of sturdier stuff than I, this could be a good time to go camping. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
