            <p>Reader, I must apologise for the intolerably wholesome nature of RPS of late. My last couple of reviews were of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">a laidback farming sim</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/routine-review">showcase of nostalgic hardware</a>. Glancing down the news feed, I note with outrage that Oisin has recently been writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/match-delightfully-silly-hand-drawn-dogs-in-dogpile-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-take-on-suika-game">Very Good Doggos</a> (being thrown into pits), while Mark has been spilling ink over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">that least offensive of politicians, Keir Starmer</a>. Time to consign Starmer, the doggos, and those fetching Macintosh-me-dos to the waste bin along with my lingering fondness for Dreamcast-era platformers. Let's cleanse our palates of sugar with a post about stinking murderous zealots. For you see, there is now a demo available for Band Of Crusaders, the new tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Polish developers Virtual Alchemy and publishers NCSoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
These aren't the crusaders your great-great-etc grandparents hopefully neither joined nor had to run away from back in the 12th century. They live in a very Witchery France that is being consumed from within by many-armed abominations, towering arch-demons, sigil-ridden cultists and... bandits. 
</p>
<p>
I did get a chuckle out of <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kxu4xg5fx3gi6dwjlgfws5hw/bafkreianzgimybybt7reciurxievyfirm3ltldyada3hpnlelzobqirty4@jpeg">this image</a>'s casual equivocation of the likes of Beelzebub with ordinary human thieves. We all remember that line from Revelations, right? "And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. Also there were some guys in hoods who stole my favourite cow. The crowned beast I can live with tbh, but I'm in the cheesemaking trade and I really needed that cow."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. You stroll around a real-time overworld in tabletop figurine form, steadily consuming resources and periodically entering your campsite to re-equip your hairy devil-dingers, level them up, and send them off to the infirmary as needed. There are quests with fairly extravagant historical fantasy writing. These take you between cities with trading facilities and a range of smaller locations, such as monasteries. While sallying forth to the latter, you will likely encounter another, opposing figurine, plunging you into a separately loading smaller real-time battlefield, where men in metal hats bellow and belabour each other with clubs and greatswords. Or sickles and pitchforks if that's all you can afford.

Thing I like: the impression of a world steadily succumbing to a demon blight. Cities have cult activity bars; I imagine you'll have a hard time buying more grain and furnace parts if the major hubs are totally overrun. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">Kingdoms mode in Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, with your party striving to prop up farflung settlements. Thing I'm indifferent on: the real-time combat seems fine, with much seemingly depending on choice of weapon: a sword won't bust up plate armour like a hammer. The weapon categories accompany a pinwheel of unlockables that skew towards roles such as tanking, DPS, etcetera. It's sturdy enough, but nothing mindblowing.
</p><p>
Things I dislike: the repetitive combat barks and the fact that all the French-accented English voice staff sound like hastily recruited exchange students. Also, I don't get the sense that this is particularly mindful of the mayhem associated with real-life Crusades; based on 30 minutes, anyway, it seems pretty free and lemon-squeezy with the "deus vult" stuff that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">has proven popular among the latter-day alt-righteous</a>. The choice of otherworldly opponents can naturally be read as dodging the association with religious pogroms and persecution.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because I could really go for a horror tactics game that investigates the ugliness of the crusader worldview, and/or leans into the garishness a la Red Hook's work. Perhaps that's where the full version of Band Of Crusaders will take us? It's not impossible. I'm not sure all of my Brothers in Fiend-Bashing are the saintly sort. My hooded advisor gives off a certain brimstone vibe. I don't like the way he looks at my cows. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526570/Band_of_Crusaders/">Steam</a>.
