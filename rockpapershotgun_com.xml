            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-platformer-paperklay-is-a-little-bit-banjo-a-little-bit-littlebigplanet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> Paperklay has perhaps the least appealing protagonists I've seen in a game recently. I hate avian buddy duo "Chick &amp; Nugget" and all their works, beginning with the ghastly 3am pun that appears to have spawned them.</p>
<p>Look at that ampersand, dangling in the middle like a chunk of gristle. What an absolute crime against typography. And chickens. And platform game levels made of paper and card - you'd never put an <em>actual</em> chicken nugget on dioramas like these, the grease would ruin it. I also mistrust Chick's beady black eyes, and I can't abide the fact that Nugget is wearing a fragment of eggshell for pants. That's like a human child using a placenta as a necktie! Argh!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Anyway, none of that matters, because Paperklay looks to be an absorbing arts-and-crafty experience with large, transforming environments. It's got music from Banjo-Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee composer Grant Kirkhope and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> composer Steven Melin. Banjo is definitely the right parallel here. Trailer, away!</p>

<p>The game launches on 27th May, and still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350720/PaperKlay/">has a demo on Steam</a>. You can expect a familiar buffet of platforming moves - double-jumping, dashing, gliding and sprinting - plus platform puzzles that involve folding, unfolding and variously messing with the layout. There are solutions that, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, rotate the entire landmass you're traversing, exposing new routes. Developer Kevin Andersson has been working on the thing for a tidy three years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhyKev">documenting the development on his Youtube channel</a>. The latest press release estimates that the full game will last five to six hours.</p>
<p>Aside from upsetting me with its puns, Paperklay also reminds me that a lot of games now trade on fancy, tactile recreations of physical materials. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumino-city">Lumino City</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hirogami">Hirogami</a>, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from just this morning.</p>
<p>All these gameworlds are exquisitely made - every object creased and cut and stamped and embroidered to perfection by the unseen hands of godly artisans. I think there's an opportunity here for an arts-and-crafts experience in which the world has been sellotaped and glued together by people with no artistic talent whatsoever. At school, I once tried to make a papier-mache sculpture of a majestic valley. When I came back the next morning, it had shucked off its wire support and curled in on itself like a dead cockroach. Give me a platform level set inside that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
