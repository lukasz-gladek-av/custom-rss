            <p>Oh, hello there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> The logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> with a name that's real awkward to stick midway through a sentence has surprise-released today, August 7th, right off the back of an appearance in a Nintendo Indie World showcase.</p>
<p>When we woke up this morning, all we knew was that this game about telling people where to stick their bottoms would be coming out in August - a vague window previously announced during June's Whole Direct. Now, it be here.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," devs Ausiàs Dalmau Roig and Sergi Pérez Crespo wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035120/view/545616987916599655?l=english">Steam post</a>. In doing so, making official the release they'd revealed with a fresh trailer in Nintyland. "Over the past two years, we have worked hard to bring you Is This Seat Taken? We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from the name, the game's all about pleasing little shape-people -  who each have different wants and demands - by seating them in the appropriate spots, with the infinite whims and limited chairs in each scene forming the challenges you'll bang your head against. Well, relatively. It looks pretty chill.</p>

<p>If you want a taste of what it offers before dropping your hard earned cash, the demo our Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-stress-free-logic-puzzles-of-is-this-seat-taken-make-for-my-favourite-demo-in-ages">played earlier this year</a> is still free to grab on Is This Seat Taken?'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">Steam page</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>"I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head," the Reuben wrote of his time with said demo, "The world's first Seatlike? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed."</p>
<p>So, there you go. It's like the video game version of a nun's robe that's secretly concealing a strap-on. Or maybe that's not quite what he meant there. You can see why when I ask Is This Seat Taken?, the answer's often a look of disdain, can't you?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-seat-taken-i-hope-not-because-the-sitting-themed-logic-puzzler-is-out-now]]></content:encoded>
