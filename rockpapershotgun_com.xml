            <p>Did you know that the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid 3</a> on PS2 had a reworked Zone of the Enders 3 prototype hidden in it? I didn't. The secret minigame in question is "Guy Savage", a barebones hack-and-slasher featuring hook swords, bestial transformations and zombie coppers. It's framed as a dream of Naked Snake's - triggered by a combination of torture and an unhelpful reference to Dracula from radio contact Para-Medic during a codec conversation before saving. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The original Guy Savage was directed by long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> writer Shuyo Murata. The dreamy minigame returns in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, an Unreal Engine remake which launches next week. It's a lot glossier this time, however, because the new version has been contracted out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> studio PlatinumGames. They've gone to town on the visuals, trading the old jailhouse backdrop for a moonlit graveyard, though the spinning and gouging looks pretty much as before. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1LIylZ8VaM">a video of the PS2 version</a>, and here's some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m0fnaLwXgw">footage of the updated one</a> from Gamespot.
</p>
<p>Learning about Guy Savage gives me the heebie jeebies, somehow. Delta Snake Eater is Konami's latest bid to show that Metal Gear Solid has a future after Hideo Kojima, but it's also a fawning tribute to the guy, a careful recreation of every eccentric flourish that took root under his eye, whether it truly came from Kojima or no.
</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult">attempted to articulate last August</a>, Delta Snake Eater feels stranger than the average blockbuster remake project because Kojima has built up a brand for bespoke designer's asides - brilliant or silly titbits born of Kojima's own proudly brandished fan obsessions, that create a feeling of closeness to the auteur, even if they were executed by one of his underlings.</p><p>Konami have extracted all those wonky fossilised organs and sent them off to be rehydrated and plumped up, then pushed them back into the game's body while grafting on new skin. In the case of the Guy Savage, the fossilised organ is also the aborted stub of <em>another</em> game, the Zone of the Enders threequel Konami cancelled in 2013. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-3s-remake-includes-a-mini-game-made-by-platinum/">Apparently</a>, Kojima wanted the minigame to be Gradius initially, but decided an original game would be better.
</p>
<p>It's just weird! Video games are weird! They are the ultimate haunted houses. This is probably the only thing I've discovered about Delta Snake Eater that seriously interests me. We'll hopefully have a review ourselves before the remake's release next week, on 28th August.</p>

            <p>I did not expect to meet Mozart in Shovel Game, nor did I expect him to ask me to mine a pyramid of shit, with the helpful advice that I start at the top to avoid any floating shitbricks. Mozart is probably the least interesting thing about Shovel Game, actually.</p>
<p>It's a shortform first-person oddity with Minecraft-style destructible voxels (yes I know Minecraft doesn't really use voxels) and a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">AHL_5am</a>. The idea is to tunnel through "a sequence of strange and unfamiliar spaces". Here's a trailer.

<p>Only certain blocks can be mined, and you'll want to dig with caution, because the catacombs are full of groaning, wailing sprites that look like Zordon from Power Rangers. It's as if somebody had cracked the glass on his energy tube, freeing the galactic wizard's blobby visage to wander the Earth in pain. Enemies kill you on contact and I've yet to discover any weapons, just my trusty shovel and an 8-ball - purpose unknown.
</p><p>It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3869670/Shovel_Game/">Steam</a>, but you can find <a href="https://lukewasthefish.itch.io/shovel-game">a demo on Itch.io</a>. Expect plenty of aggravation: there's a labyrinth full of oozy blue phantoms that requires fast footwork. Also a kind of cosmic chapel full of what appear to be flattened babies. The developer is Luke Vincent, who created it for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-002/entries">"shovelware horror" gamejam</a>, ho ho.</p>
<p>Bonus game mention: leafing through the submissions page for that jam, I discover a new work from Mike Klubnika, architect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-mike-klubnika">S.p.l.i.t.</a>, which Nic had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/split-review">eloquent emotions about</a>. Co-developed with James Dornan, Klubnika's jam game is called <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it">Crank It</a> and is about being stuck behind a set of gadgets in a cavernous hallway, trying to spot horrible creatures. Got to say, this sounds far worse than shit pyramid Mozart.</p>
