I really quite like how simple a title <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratopia">Ratopia</a> has. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategic</a> survival city builder, where you have to build a nice place for rats to live. Ratopia! It gets straight to the heart of it, and it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2244130/view/538852710067208196?l=english">just received its 1.0 release today</a> after an early access period of 18 months. The game has had a lengthy development time too, starting way back in 2020, and in a Steam post discussing the 1.0 release, developers Cassel Games left a nice and lengthy list covering everything that's been added across its early access release.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That includes things like a diplomacy system, character customisation, even a disease system, which does make me sad, but rats are generally known for being carriers of all sorts. In terms of gameplay, there's definitely a bit of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> vibe to it given that your rats walk around 2D landscapes, digging at squares to build settlements. All the rats apparently have their "own wealth and unique characteristics", though, I have to say, developing capitalism but for rats doesn't seem very utopic.

<p>
This 1.0 update also adds in a new leader perk system, which offers, you guessed it, perks for your leader rat. That can be for things like recovering health at certain times of day, or to help you cultivate plants. Those that like to tweak their challenge to suit them have some new options to tweak things like choosing which kinds of enemies invade, changing the season order, or just outright turning crime off. There's the utopia I'm looking for!
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more than that too, and Cassel Games did say that they plan to release more updates in the future too, as well as Steam Deck improvements. It's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244130/Ratopia/">currently 20% off</a>, which technically is just keeping it at it's early access price more or less, so you've got until May 14th to get it slightly cheaper than you will pass that point. Oh, and there's a demo too! Lots of options for you.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> has fallen from grace a touch, it seems. The dress-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> arrived on Steam last week, almost five months since it launched on the Epic Games Store, but it did so with quite a few caveats. For starters, the game's latest update 1.5 arrived around the same time, leading to a plethora of issues with the game, quite notably frequent crashes. Then there's also been a large number of Chinese players expressing their frustration with some of the changes on the game's Steam forusm, namely the increase in cost of banners. This has led to the game hitting a Mixed rating on Steam, so the game's dev has come out with a big ole apology literally asking for "one more chance."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The apology was shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikkiofficial/comments/1karmi3/apology_letter_regarding_version_15_gaming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">official Infinity Nikki subreddit</a>, where the devs admitted to falling "short of expectations. Following the version update, we received a lot of feedback regarding game experience issues, primarily concerning the DIY Workshop, co-op feature, and overall game performance, including issues such as login failures, crashes, and resolution problems."
</p>
<p>
However, on that point of the cost of banners, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/papergames">Papergames</a> didn't seem quite so willing to make a change. You see, some new five-star outfits now cost 11 pieces, where they'd either been nine or ten before, making the odds to pull them a lot harder. 
</p>
<p>
Papergames tried to justify this by saying they "introduced highly dynamic special effects for the pieces and special aurora effects for the hair" with these new banners, apologising for the "lack of prior communication regarding this adjustment," and promising that the number of pieces in five-star outfits is guaranteed not to exceed 11. A noticeable lack of saying "yeah we're not going to make them cost that much anymore" for my liking.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Papergames have been a touch shaken by this response given that they also asked everyone to "Please give us one more chance - to let Nikki's starlight continue to shine for us all, and to keep the warmth in our hearts forever burning bright." At least they're keeping their copy consistent.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release date remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xbox-stop-trying-to-make-silksong-happen-its-not-going-to-happen">shitpost</a>, beyond that it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-release-date-confirmed-for-2025">fall in 2025</a>, but we do at least now know that you'll be able to play it in September, as long as you go to one particular museum in Melbourne, Australia. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The museum in question is the National Museum of Screen Culture, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a>. A playable version of Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> will apparently be on display there from September 18th, together with materials from the game's development. Will the exhibited version be the finished version, and if so, can we assume that Silksong will be on sale before then? Reader, your guess is as good as mine. Team Cherry do love to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed-because-its-gotten-quite-big">lead their fans a merry dance</a>. There are gods and oceans more knowable than Team Cherry. There are fairy queens less fey. Mind you, it doesn't help that people keep coming up with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">conspiracy theories about cake</a>.
</p>
<p>
Silksong will form part of an exhibition called Game Worlds, which features levels from 30 games including World Of Warcraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neopets">Neopets</a>. Co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell have this to say: "From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"

They've also shared the above sheet of the aforesaid hundreds of sprite animations. I'm pretty sure my body isn't capable of that many sprites. I risk putting my hip out if I go over 30. Anyway, I wonder how many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> players are even now booking airline tickets. Perhaps the secret agenda here is to get more gamers into museums?
