            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch has arrived ahead of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">slightly delayed Redacted Regiment warbond</a> also making its sneaky debut today, January 22nd. In line with that warbond's stealthy shushness, this patch has seen Arrowhead add in new commando missions designed to reward those who know when to crouch-walk. They've also revealed that the slim build that's been in beta for a little while is finally ready to take the reigns from the standard version and its very chunky install size.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731129453?l=english">patch notes</a> describe the new commando missions as follows: "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> are going deep behind enemy lines where their normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option. Reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time." As such, knowing when to kill quietly or co-ordinate a rush with other players will be key.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to test out some tuning up of suppressed guns, which should now be "more valuable in stealth gameplay and attract less attention from enemies", as a result of firing noise radius tweaks. As part of that, foes like the devastator, berserker, spewer, charger, impaler, and observer have been made a bit more chill about bullets landing vaguely in their vicinity, so non-hits are less likely to instantly draw their ire.</p>
<p>Outside of the sneaky stuff, the slim build of Helldivers 2 which Arrowhead have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">beta testing as part of efforts to cut the 154GB game down to just 23GB</a> in terms of install size will no longer be in beta at some point soon.</p><p>"We are ready to make the slim PC build default for all players," The studio wrote. "We’ll keep the larger version online for a short time to ensure a smooth transition for everyone; so you’ll continue to have the option to switch back should you wish. Once this transition has been completed we’ll look to sunset the large build permanently in the near future." As of writing, no exact date for the initial switch appears to have been given, but it sounds like it'll be ASAP.</p>
<p>Rounding out this first drop of new Helldivers 2 stuff for 2026 was a promise that there's "much more to come in February and beyond", as you'd hope. For now, in the spirit of these sneaky missions, Arrowhead aren't giving too much away.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s efforts to break ground while Gittin’ Back To When Battlefield Was Gud continue with the announcement of two forthcoming maps in the EA shooter’s second season, which begins 17th February. One of the maps is Contaminated, a brand new field of battle that is comparable in scale to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>’s St Quentin Scar and Arras in Battlefield 5. The other is a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>’s Golmud Railway – a big, grassy vehicular affair, based on China’s actually existing Golmud-Lhasa railway line.
</p>
<p>
“In this next session, we’ll be testing content on one of Season 2’s new maps: Contaminated,” explains <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">an EA social post</a>. “We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries. We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.
</p>
<p>
“While we’re saving full details on the new map for a later time,” it continues, “we can share that in terms of size, Contaminated falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley, and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar (Battlefield 1) or Arras (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>).”
</p>
<p>
As for Golmud Railway, EA’s goal is “to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems”. It’ll be the biggest Battlefield 6 map ever. EA will release it first in Battlefield Labs so that they can “test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time”.
</p><p>
Speaking of those wily airplanes, the devs are also testing out changes to vehicle handling in the run-up to Season 2. This includes tweaks to the AH-6 Little Bird, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD_Helicopters_MH-6_Little_Bird">Killer Egg</a>, which looks much like how an egg might look if you mounted cannons on it and parked a bunch of screaming jarheads on each side. The fan favourite chopper appears in the game's singleplayer, and can be spawned in Battlefield Portal, but is not formally part of BF6 multiplayer right now. The devs are considering “how it fits within the broader vehicle ecosystem and how it performs across different combat scenarios”.
</p>
<p>
They’re also doing some initial testing on “Aircraft Radar, an important part of the aircraft gameplay experience and a system we’re actively evaluating as part of future air combat improvements”. As I understand it, this is a feature that extends your radar range so you can better track aircraft, which tend to be pretty fast. Unless I’m piloting them, in which case they tend to explode on the runway.
</p>
<p>
“In parallel, we’ll be exploring a tuning package focused on rocket and vehicle interactions, including early adjustments to weapons such as RPGs and TOW launchers, as well as vehicle handling considerations when countering rockets,” the devs continue. There’s some talk of testing improvements “to hit registration and overall combat consistency”, to avoid “scenarios where players may be eliminated after reaching cover, often referred to as ‘death behind cover’ or desync-related behavior.”
</p>
<p>
Last and maybe, possibly not least, the devs are doing more testing around solo play in the battle royale mode. They want to understand “where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences”. They note that there will never be a “single permanent configuration” for the game’s Plunkbat equivalent. It shall shift and alter like wind through the grasses of Golmund Railway when some absolute plonker crashlands a Killer Egg on take-off.
