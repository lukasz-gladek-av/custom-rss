            <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> Unlimited, a community project that aims to make Ubisoft racer The Crew playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, have announced a release date.</p>
<p>If you need a bit of a refresher, Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">take The Crew's servers offline</a> in March 2024 rendered it totally unplayable even for those who own a physical copy, due to its online-only nature. That's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">served as the spark</a> for the Stop Killing Games campaign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">we've reported on</a> as its organisers have petitioned lawmakers across the world to ensure companies are required by law to put concrete end-of-life plans in place, when they decide to switch a game's servers off. It also set a group of Crewers off on a quest to make the game playable again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For a year or so, The Crew Unlimited's devs have been working towards that goal. They've now announced a release date for their creation, which comprises of a server emulator designed to stand in for those Ubisoft took offline. As per an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1412163460955115520">Discord</a> from project lead whammy4, it'll come out on September 15th, 2025, and be distributed for free to minimise the chances of the publisher directing their lawyers to intervene.</p>
<p>"We were trying everything we could, anything to preserve the game," reads The Crew Unlimited's freshly published <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">website</a>. "We eventually came to the conclusion that writing a server emulator for The Crew was the best and only solution. This would allow us to effectively implement both an Offline Mode and an Online Mode back into the game, Offline Mode simply being a local server running on your computer while playing the game. Your local server, your local savegames, your game. No one will ever be able to take this away from you now."</p><p>The Crew Unlimited'll be grabbable from that same site once it's live, and you'll need to have owned The Crew on PC before to access it, as the devs won't be illegally distributing game files. You know, because that'd almost definitely result in Ubisoft's lawyers coming down like a ton of bricks. Though, the project's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ</a> does see them admit that they've got no way on their end of telling a legit copy from a pirated copy, so they'll have to let all players in regardless, which sounds far from ideal.</p>
<p>In a Discord discussion linked in the FAQ, the devs have made some notes about what works in terms of re-downloading your old The Crew save files. I'd say players may well be in for a tricky time getting things up and running. The devs say you'll need to start from scratch unless you only want to play offline, and have already used a tool they developed to dump your save prior to the game's shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they also hint that their online server may harbour a few additions or changes. That said, the group insist tweaks outside of any new stuff would be limited to "technical improvements and careful rebalancing", and that they'd "never change the core experience of the game".</p>
<p>All in all, even though the project's been public info for around a year now, with whammy4 having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIo4l-BpK8s">posted videos of them driving around in it</a> to YouTube, it's maybe worth waiting to see how the release plays out before you give it a go.</p>

            <p>The lead designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> has announced that he's making something like Left 4 Dead again - a four-player co-op shooter that "expands on the co-op-formula in ways I've wanted to explore for a long time".
</p>
<p>Whatever they end up calling it, the game is in development at Bad Robot Games, a studio founded by the film and TV outfit behind Lost, Cloverfield and Westworld. So the project has both expertise and funding to spare, in theory. There is little else to tell, right now, but you can sign up for a playtest if all this has you combing the rooftops for Smokers and scrabbling around for your shotgun.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Former Turtle Rock creative director Mike Booth announced the project in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/">a Reddit post this week</a>. "If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead aside, Booth has credits on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-condition-zero">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>. He worked for Valve after they acquired Turtle Rock in 2008, then left in 2012 to join Blizzard and work on something unannounced. Then he went to Facebook to work on multiplayer virtual reality mcGuffins for the Oculus Rift. Most recently, he joined the board of directors for Resolution, creators of tabletop RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>. Here's hoping the new Left 4 Deadlike isn't some kind of VR exclusive, or otherwise tainted by exposure to Mark Zuckerberg's skullfucking metaverse meanderings.
</p><p>"We're still in the early stages of development, but we're opening up playtests to a limited number of players," Booth added in the Reddit post. "If you're interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we'd love to have you involved." You can sign up for a playtest <a href="https://www.badrobotgames.com/invite">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm always keen to play anything Left 4 Deadlike, but I have been burned before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> was not the unofficial Left 4 Dead 3 its title format implied, partly because it tried to make Left 4 Dead's spontaneously 'AI-directed', playable B-movie gambit work within a clunky latter-day progression system.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">had fun with Back 4 Blood</a>, admittedly, calling it "peak early-00s cheese". And there have been other, recent quatrofoil co-operational bangalongs that pull off something like the old L4D vibe, such as Fatshark's various first-person Warhammer games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a> from 10 Chambers, and dwarven asteroid miner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.
</p>
<p>(Side note to Rock Paper Shotgun's automatic keyword linking system: why do you link some game titles, and not others? Why do you vex and torment me so? I will never unravel your heathen wiles and mocking parlor tricks.)</p>
<p>As for the possibility of an actual Left 4 Dead 3 - those magic words <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files">appear in relatively recent Valve documentation</a>, but I've seen little evidence that such a project is in active development. Right now, the Steam company appear focussed on perennial chart topper Counter-Strike 2 and the upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock. As for Booth's old joint Turtle Rock, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-2-appears-to-be-a-thing-which-is-a-shame-because-id-rather-play-a-new-evolve">appear to be making Back 4 Blood 2</a>, which displeases me inasmuch as I'd rather they make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been a little while since we got another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> tease that makes folks wonder whether CD Projekt are about to u-turn on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">adding more stuff to it</a> yet again. Here one is, though, and it invites us 2025 dwellers to help out a president who isn't elected in-universe until 2065.</p>
<p>Is it evidence that the NUSA have invented time travel tech that also allows Cyberpunk characters to migrate into our own reality? Is it just a way to spice up some promo for something like a livestream or minor reveal? I mean, almost definitely the latter, but the former's a lot more fun to consider.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, the tease. NUSA president Rosalind Myers, the one from Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty expansion, needs "brave netrunners" to help her nation overcome a "mounting cybersecurity threat". The plea's dated September 4th, 2025, which is in the future, but not quite far enough into the future to match up with Myers' in-game presidential term. That kicks off in 2065, which is why she's still in power by the time V meets her in 2077.</p>
<p>What's president Roz doing teasing things dated about 40 years before she takes office, that're also happening in a different universe? Are Arasaka about to take over the official Witcher socials to post their own messages to us, inciting a seven hundredth corporate Twitter war? Are Kang Tao about to reveal they're behind the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">mysterious Project Hadar</a>? As I say, probably not. If this is anything, the netrunner "recruitment test" aspect seems to hint at an ARG of some sort being in the offing.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Naturally, some fans have immediately gone off the deep end with extra expansion theories. If that's you, it's maybe worth bearing in mind that CD Projekt senior community manager Amelia Korzycka has responded to one user on the tweeter asking what the tease is with <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965">the following message</a>: "All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch."
 </p>
<p>"'The' DLC? Instead of 'a' DLC?Y ou're gonna dive people crazy, you know that right? Me included," another user replied to Korzycka. "Is there an expansion DLC in the works?" The community manager, I assume after a deep sigh, has simply <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962759935608938808">responded to this query</a> with a "No."</p>
<p>Given that, I'd very much temper your expectations. It'd be foolish to totally rule out CD Projekt adding yet more stuff to Cyberpunk given the past few years, though. Here's hoping they at least explain Myers' ability to move through time and space.</p>
<p>Has it required her to fork over a bit of her brain space to Neo from The Matrix doing his best dickhead rock singer impression? Will Cyberpunk 2 be about stopping Roz and/or Idris Elba's Solomon Reed from going back in time to kill one of V's ancestors while dressed in leather and speaking like the most Austrian cyborg you've ever met? We need answers.</p>
