            <p>How long do you tend to spend creating a character in a video game? The correct answer is three hours. Four hours if it's a Bethesda game, because creating a character in a Bethesda game is like rewinding the Raiders Of The Lost Ark face-melting scene while shooting at your TV with Homer Simpson's Make-Up Gun. It takes patience to extract beauty or even just plain inoffensiveness from the Creation Engine's sticky coils.</p>
<p>Hang on, why am I being mean to Bethesda? I should be directing my snide remarks at Capcom. It turns out the scalliwags want you to pay a small fee to edit your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> character's voice, face and body structure more than once - so if you're buying today, you might want to spend a few more hours perfecting that Hunter physique at start-up.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes care of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/">VGC</a>, who've spotted a Monster Hunter Wilds - Character Edit Voucher: Three-Voucher Pack <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648">on Steam</a>, currently priced at £5.49, €6.99 or $6.99. Each voucher lets you "redo your character creation and debut a new look". The base game includes access to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/?curator_clanid=4777282">one of these vouchers for free</a>. There's a similar DLC voucher pack for your Palico, a catlike helper that accompanies you through the wastes.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of nickel-and-diming I wouldn't call this abysmal, because I seldom feel the need to fundamentally redesign my character more than once. My current Monster Hunter Wilds character looks like an ailing prog rock musician, and I'm confident that's a vibe that'll carry me to the credits. Besides which, you can still give your Hunter a <em>cosmetic</em> makeover without handing over your lunch money to Capcom: the base game lets you "edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher".</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit cheeky. A reminder that somewhere above the artwork you're enjoying sit a bunch of salivating men in bow ties and tophats, holding comically oversized knives and forks.</p>
<p>Capcom have form for this kind of thing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/critically-acclaimed-dragons-dogma-2-hits-mostly-negative-on-steam-after-players-raze-it-for-microtransactions">garlanded</a> with 21 pieces of DLC at launch, offering optional paid access to items used for fast travel, self-revival and hiring allies. It's more thematically appropriate to Monster Hunter, perhaps, in that Monster Hunter is a game about carving things up into sellable commodities and raw materials. Wilds has been on sale for a few hours and already has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/">40 items of DLC</a> - I'd say they're flogging every part of the pig except the squeal, but there's probably a Squeal Voucher in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Kislev campaign on release was one of the best storified strategy game times I've had in years, launch issues be thrice-damned, triple cooked, and three times a lady. But the Slavic bulwark against stinky, angry, tricksy and horny invaders has lost some lustre since. The details in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/67">Creative Assembly's latest blog</a> are still a work in progress, but give a solid idea of how Kislev as a faction are changing in a patch due mid-March.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Creative Assembly said a while back that they'd be tweaking the pricing structure for the Shadows Of Change DLC to bring it in line with the a la carte factions from other recent expansions. The Kislev-Cathay-Tzeentch expansion was beefed up post-release with new units, and now it's getting some more love: joining Kislev, Now It's Ursunal are toys for Kairos Fateweaver, and suprise new units for Cathay and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ogre">Ogre</a> Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The biggest news here is that they've axed the supporter race between Katarin and Assputin completely. You'll instead "curry favour with the Orthodoxy to improve your common line troops, strengthen your economy and improve your invocations. And support the Ice court in order to improve your elite infantry, spellcasting and hero usage."</p>
<p>This isn't a race, but there'll apparently be consequences ("unrest") if you focus too much on one side over the other. I'm torn over this. I'm up for regular buffs and army theming all day long, but it sounds like there's already a single correct way to play baked in to the system, with perhaps just a little leeway to make choices if you don't want to suffer penalties. I'd say I'd withhold judgement but the judgement has clearly already wriggled out from  my grasp and made itself known, in print no less.</p>
<p>Also dead is the ubiquitous province control system, replaced with an updated version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. "It acts much like Control, but can be spent on local invocations to temporarily boost the local province, or to empower an army temporarily".</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kislev-rework-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>The tech tree is getting an overhaul ("no longer locked behind owning the Kislev capitals"!) as is the Attamans system. They're getting their own unique skill trees, plus the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Atamans now enable a new feature for settlements, tentatively called “Garrison Sally Attack” where you can command settlements managed by them to engage enemies within a limited distance, as if the settlements themselves were armies. Of course, the capital of the province is lead by the Ataman himself, who takes the field with the garrison during this attack."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exciting because it a) just sounds very useful and b) opens up the possibility of Wood Elf tree settlements being able to uproot themselves and branch batter invaders somewhere down the line.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kairos-rework-1.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For fate-weaving failbird Kairos, there's a whole pick n' mix lore system:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The core promise of the fragments of sorcery feature was versatility to build your own composite lore. And the design quickly narrowed in on a true “any combination you want” feature that completely did away with the idea of an ancillary slot, and moved the decision making to its own tab of the character detail panel."</p></blockquote>
<p>Do pop over to the blog for some more detailed visuals, but it basically looks like you'll be able to slot in what spells you want and switch between heads to access more than usual. It's a touch vague at the moment though.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two new units: grenadiers for Cathay and Gnoblar slingers for the Ogre Kingdoms. The grenadiers are vulnerable but powerful bomb hurlers with a debuff stun grenade, and the slingers look like Skavenslave slingers but less perfect, beautiful, graceful, and valiant.</p>
<p>I do enjoy all the work in progress art for its transparency in revealing that videogames look mostly awful for 95% of their development. I once played a grey box version of a game where all the characters in cutscenes had their faces replaced by real time clips of the actors doing mocap. Deeply disconcerting stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>AMD have finally confirmed pricing, dating, and specs-ing for their first RDNA 4 graphics cards. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ces-2025-announcements-include-what-will-probably-be-yet-another-worlds-fastest-cpu">Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT</a> will be out on March 6th, and start from $549 and $599 respectively. While these are still relatively fat stacks o' cash, AMD say they’ll compete with Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">RTX 5070</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review">RTX 5070 Ti</a> – and considering the latter is supposed to start at $749, with most models currently going for above $800, that could make for a tasty undercutting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5070 hasn’t launched yet and its $549 MSRP is dead even with that of the RX 9070, though the Radeon does have an edge in the VRAM department, with 16GB to the GeForce’s 12GB. The RX 9070 XT shares this spec, while upping boost clock speeds from 2.54GHz to 2.97GHz and adding a few more RDNA Compute Units (64 to 56 on the RX 9070). Its RT Accelerator count also comes in at 64 to the RX 9070’s 56, so expect superior ray tracing performance as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the absence of reliable benchmarks, we can’t say for now which will be best for that crucial GPU workload of Making Numbers Go Bigger. Still, I’d argue that Nvidia and AMD haven’t so much been competing on framerates these last few years as they have on those secondary technologies: DLSS, FSR, frame generation and so on. And here, the Radeon versions have been hopelessly outmatched, be it on visual quality, general performance, or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">breadth of support among games</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are, in some ways, most RTX-like than any Radeon GPU has been for ages. By embracing a similar flavour of AI and machine learning, they’ll be the first (and, for a while, only) cards to support FSR 4, which itself is abandoning the GPU-agnostic rule of previous versions by basing its upscaling and anti-aliasing on that very same robot brain tech. In other words, FSR is becoming much more DLSS-y. This won’t extend to copying the Multi Frame Generation component of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, but FSR 4’s standard 2x frame gen is supposedly much sharper than stabler than that of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>, while the upscaling component aims to make drastic improvements to image quality. FSR 4 will also have over 30 compatible games at launch, dozens more than FSR 3 did, and rising to 75 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Given DLSS 4 has only just launched, I think it’s probably fine if FSR 4 simply plays catch-up to DLSS on picture quality, rather than surpassing it – and for $200 less, the RX 9070 XT could be one compelling card if it can simultaneously match the RTX 5070 Ti’s core performance. Of course, GPUs are in high demand right now, and it would be unsurprising (if deeply unfortunate) for these RDNA 4 cards to suffer the same problem of price-hiked and under-stocked partner models that the RTX 50 series is buckling under. AMD, one suspects, will be crossing their fingers that the eBay reseller crowd already has their hands full with garages of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080s</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
