            <p>Mark’s on holiday today, which means we can’t do our usual thing of workplace-bullying him into writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> while we sit around in wingback chairs drinking Glenfiddich. But if he were here, he’d surely be thrilled to note <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/thicker-2026-plans">this PCGN interview</a> with Bethesda Game Studios creative director Jon Rush, who says he hopes the multiplayer RPG can become "thicker" in 2026. Oh my.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>More specifically, Rush explains how following the major map-widening expansions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-has-a-hellish-new-area-and-bethesda-want-you-to-nuke-it">Skyline Valley</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Burning Springs</a> – the latter also serving as a tie-in with Amazon’s mostly decent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-is-fuelling-another-steam-player-bump-as-folks-once-again-remember-they-like-fallout">Fallout TV adaptation</a> – the hope is now to build up Fallout 76’s existing spaces, adding depth as well as breadth.</p>
<p>"For this next year, I really want our gaze to shift from the outskirts to inwards - make the game thicker," he says, conjuring up mental images of a glowing and uncomfortably spicy roux. "New systems or new ways to engage with existing content, those are all very much on the menu for this year."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Bethesda Softworks / Bethesda Game Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is some pragmaticism behind the shift in update tactics, with "technical considerations" precluding an endless widening of the game’s explorable world – "we can’t just continue making the map bigger and bigger," as Rush puts it. But filling out and adding to the wasteland survival pursuits in more familiar locales has been tried before, with success. Rush points to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-latest-update-relaxes-its-building-rules-so-you-can-try-erecting-a-nuclear-bunker-in-mid-air">loosening of the building rules</a> for Fallout 76’s C.A.M.P. construction, which enabled more ambitious and creative settlement builds across a wider range of terrain, as an example of how such, erm, <em>thickening</em> makes for a better game.</p><p>The C.A.M.P. changes were, he says, designed to "allow people to get to engage with the world in more ways than they could before... [the updates] had a huge impact on our players, and the things that they want to do in the world."</p>
<p>While it might therefore be a good long time before Fallout 76’s vault dwellers will be exploring any truly untouched patches of irradiated dirt, it sounds like Bethesda will be providing plenty more things to do on home turf. In the meantime, why not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-tour-of-fallout-76s-burning-springs-with-our-recently-defrosted-ohioan-historian">take a tour of Burning Springs’ lovingly wrecked Ohio</a> with a gen-yoo-ayyyyyn Ohio historian? It’s what Mark would have wanted.</p>

            <p>HBO’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> TV adaptation is likely ending with its upcoming third season, according to network CEO Casey Bloys. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">Deadline</a>, that boy Bloys used his voice to address the noise that the joys of the Naughty Dog-inspired series would end with season three, saying "It certainly seems that way." Pedro Pascal’s dreams, destroyed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Bloys did add that "on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners," which in The Last of Us' case is Craig Mazin, also the creator of Chernobyl (the show, not the nuclear disaster). The same Craig Mazin who told <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">Collider</a>, during the airing of the well-received second season, that "there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season." Which might be reassuring to some, though a) Bloy’s comments are a lot more up-to-date than Mazin’s and b) if network executives truly knew how to "defer" to showrunners, we might have had more than six measly episodes of Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace.</p> <figure>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VamgprCpEGw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Still, at current rates of adaptivisation, Mazin might have a point. The Last of Us' first season was a fairly faithful creation of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">original zombies 'n' sadness game</a>, and while season two tinkered more with its take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">TLOU Part II</a>, it ultimately covered less than half of the latter's notoriously bleak story. Season three of the show could just be longer, though.</p>
<p>Plans may also have changed in light of TLOU game director Neil Druckmann, who was co-showrunning the adapatation with Mazin, <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">leaving to focus back on Naughty Dog</a>. The Sony-owned dev house is currently working on science fiction adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, though if Druckmann's return from Tinseltown was meant to help keep it on track, that maybe hasn’t panned out: reports emerged late last year that staff were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crunch-returns-to-naughty-dog-for-xmas-as-intergalactic-devs-work-overtime-on-a-demo-for-sony-claims-report">put under mandatory crunch</a> to finish an internal demo, an alleged return to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">brutal work conditions</a> that plagued development of The Last of Us Part II.</p>

            <p>
Nine years after securing $3.2 million on Kickstarter and mere weeks after launching into Steam Early Access, MMORPG Ashes Of Creation is in humongous difficulties. The game’s entire leadership team have allegedly quit “in protest” at decisions made by the board of Intrepid Studios, with creative director Steven Sharif accusing board members of “directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out”. Other staff have announced that they've been laid off, with one calling it the end of the studio.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-creation-kickstarter">Kickstarted back in 2017</a>, Ashes Of Creation finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">launched in Steam early access</a> on 11th December. It’s an ambitious concoction - a game in which players will collectively organise to “build cities” and “forge empires” amongst other realm-rewriting feats - but the early access launch version has attracted a mixed user reviewer response. 
</p>
<p>Intrepid sought to reassure the nay-sayers in <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">a blog post on 29th January</a>, listing a few problems such as cheating and performance issues, but a few players noted that this “director’s letter” was attributed to the AOC team rather than Sharif. In hindsight, some of the language in the post strikes me as rather ominous. For example:</p>
<blockquote>Game development, especially at this scale, is rarely linear. Systems evolve. Assumptions are challenged. Foundations must sometimes be reworked, so what comes next can stand strong. That process can be uncomfortable, particularly in an open development environment where you see the seams as they’re stitched. But it is also what allows us to build something ambitious, durable, and worthy of your investment.</blockquote>
<p>
Then, on Saturday January 31st, director of communications Margaret Krohn abruptly declared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that her time at Intrepid had "officially ended”, while claiming that other developers had lost their jobs. Asked whether Ashes Of Creation had been cancelled, she replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off." 
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGamesN</a>, senior environment artist Adam Anthony, QA engineer Keith McAvoy, senior character artist Jessica Jennings, and animator Brad Constantine have all announced on LinkedIn that they’ve been laid off. Anthony has referred to these events as "the closing of Intrepid Studios”.
</p>
<p>
Sharif has also given some comment on Discord, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashes-of-creations-leadership-team-quits-in-protest-as-director-accuses-board-of-decisions-he-could-not-ethically-agree-with-or-carry-out">Eurogamer</a>. "I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," he wrote in the wake of Krohn’s post. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out.</p>
<p>"As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification] Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."
</p><p>
We’ll reach out to Intrepid to ask whether Intrepid has, indeed, been closed. Best of luck to all the devs now looking for new work. Ashes Of Creation is still available on Steam, as of writing - there's a 'development update livestream' planned for Friday 13th February, but something tells me they'll change the schedule.
