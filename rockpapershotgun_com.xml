            <p>The last Minesweeperalike I wrote up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a sparkling slurry of mind-altering pop-ups and resinous AI cleavage</a>. It was David Cronenberg's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I'd put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It's Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's right, Dragonsweeper is Minesweeper but an RPG. It's a smart genre hybrid that gives the principle of tentatively clicking blank squares to reveal nearby mines a level-up system, and swaps (most of) the mines for monsters like walking skeletons, gremlins and, yes, dragons. I know, I know: giving hitherto unencumbered games a progression mechanic is cultural vandalism, but trust me, it's more charming than you might guess.</p>
<p>Uncleared tiles near the exposed play area have numbers on them. In regular Minesweeper, these indicate the number of explosives nearby, but there's a little more to it here. Part of Dragonsweeper's fun, of course, is working out how, exactly, developer Daniel Benmergui has glued all these archetypes together, so I won't say anything further. If you're stuck, though, there's a manual with a bestiary.</p>
<p>You can play Dragonsweeper in a browser <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper">right here</a>. Thanks very much to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-29">Maw</a> feeder Titus Groen for passing this on. It has swallowed up a couple of my teabreaks, though I've yet to actually clear the board. If you prefer vanilla Minesweeper, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-minesweeper">a little lookback</a> from Matthew Castle (RPS in peace).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
