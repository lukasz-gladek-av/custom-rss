I feel like every time I write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, I always have to add a caveat along the lines of, "I don't really like shootersâ€¦ but!" There often is a but, because occasionally one of 'em rolls around that feels like it just gets me, you know? This week, it's a shooter that feels like it was born to be a Flash game on Newgrounds in the mid-2000s that you'll sometimes bring up to your friends saying "man, remember that one game?" It's called Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion, and as simple as its title is, there's a lot going for it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, it's being made by Bubby Darkstar, the same developer behind 2021's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750570/Subway_Midnight/">Subway Midnight</a>, a game I'm always surprised by insofar that it doesn't have as far reaching an obsessive fan base as I thought it would get. Subway Midnight is already a visually surreal delight, but Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion really looks like it's amping up the balls to the walls zaniness factor. It apparently has over 200 NPCs to "interact and have terrible conversations with," all of which are hand-drawn, a kind of ridiculous feat for what I think might be a dev team of not much more than one.

<p>
You've also got more than 50 unique robots to take on, dozens of bosses, "a guy named 'Donnie' who's a real freak" and six levels to wade through. Gameplay wise it looks like your classic boomer shooter by way of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>, plenty of regular guns to find and use, alongside a few weirder ones. This thing just looks worth playing through if you're an animation lover alone, the colours are so vibrant and some of the designs on display feel like they were born to be turned into Twitter profile pictures (but like, when Twitter wasn't what it is now, when it was sometimes ok and not a constant hellfire).
</p>
<p>
The trailer also clearly points out that not a drop of generative AI was used to make it, a disclaimer that I wish didn't have to exist, but one I'm glad to see all the same. It's not too far away from release either - currently it's slated to be released next month, July 10th. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/?curator_clanid=4777282">here</a>.

            <p>
Despite having received a plethora of updates, bits of DLC, and expansion packs over the course of the past 11 years, there are still things that featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 3 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is yet to receive. Seriously, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has been supported for twice the length of time The Sims 3 was, and yet it's only this year that it's getting a pack that features fairies. They'll be coming in the just announced Enchanted by Nature pack, which includes a bit more than just a new supernatural designation for your Sims.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The biggest thing is the fairies though, so let's start with that. Thanks to literal Mother Nature, you'll be able to turn any of your Sims into fairies, with a couple of different paths laid out before them. You can either turn them into a Harmonious Fairy, a "benevolent winged helper who wants to aide other living things find health and balance," or a Discordant Fairy, a "flying mischief-maker that enjoys stirring up a little chaos and making everyday life harder for the Sims around them."

<p>
Fairies also come with some unique abilities like being able to nurture plants or change other Sims' moods. Sounds a bit manipulative if you ask me, but The Sims is all about the drama really isn't it? You can customise the fairy version of your Sims too, from wings, to ears, to glowing tattoos and beyond. I'd also like to point out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/maxis">Maxis</a> shared fairies can "even use their Fairy charm to deliver a special WooHoo!" They somewhat know their audience, at least.
</p>
<p>
There's a new area coming with this expansion too, Innisgreen, which looks like something out of the dreams of a 2020-era cottagecore TikToker. This one's made up of three neighbourhoods, a seaside village, a towny sort of area with shops and houses to live in, and a magical forest. There's a bevy of whimsical looking items to build up new homes with too.
</p>
<p>
It seems that your Sims can also get imbalanced when they lose control of their life a bit, which can make them learn skills a bit slower than normal. This can lead to ailments, which actually have both pros and cons, but you can fix these by making cures and elixirs on the new apothecary table. You can read all of this in more detail over in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/enchanted-by-nature-expansion-pack">blog post from EA</a>.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and you've not got long to wait for this one either, as it's currently due out next month, July 10th.
