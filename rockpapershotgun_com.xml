            <p>
I feel like all I've been seeing the past few days is people asking if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will be the game that finally brings extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> into the mainstream. No one seems to be quite sure, mostly because it isn't done or out yet. The thing is, it's not the only extraction shooter due out this year that'll put that question to the test, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one the way still too. It comes from former Battlefield devs after all, who have found success with their other shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>. And earlier today, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> announced that another playtest for Arc Raiders is on the way this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Signing up for the playtest is pretty simple on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a>, you just have to head to the game's page and request access to the beta. The test itself is running from April 30 to May 4. Not everyone will be able to try it out, I should note, it's luck of the draw, but if you're feeling lucky and you're curious as to whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream, it's worth a shot.

<p>
In a press release Embark shared that they've taken on a bunch of feedback from the last test, implementing a bunch of "tweaks and improvements." They've also added in more Arc enemies (evil robots that have taken over most of the world), as well as weapons and gear. Player progression and crafting systems are apparently "deeper" now too, and there'll be a preview of what the game's battle pass will be like.
</p>
<p>
I like the vibes of Arc Raiders a lot. Bit of a stereotypical "humans are in hiding in tiny settlements because robots have wrecked the planet" kind of premise, though it looks good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs&amp;ab_channel=ARCRaiders">in motion</a>, and I'm digging its particular flavour of a post-apocalypse setting.
</p>
<p>
That's the thing though, Marathon looks good in motion too, and based on most previews, plays good too. There's some specific complaints people are having about Marathon (namely a worrying lack of content at launch) which raises further questions as to whether it'll be the one to make a notoriously tough genre like extraction shooters popular.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can't say how things will shake out. Games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> are still trudging along quite well, maybe it doesn't need to be a massively popular genre. Guess we'll have an idea by the end of the year!

It's been a little over a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palia">Palia</a> had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today. This update is mostly focused on a new area, the titular Elderwood, and it'll be free for everyone. That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now.

You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a "new equipment system that buffs you and your party." On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a>, so, no complaints here!
</p>
<p>
The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/runescape-returns-as-an-open-world-survival-rpg-in-which-you-hunt-a-dragon-queen">just a couple of weeks ago</a>, and today developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/jagex">Jagex</a> hosted a livestream where they showed a deep-dive of the game and revealed the game's release date. Turns out, it's today! As in right now, today, as in you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">go to Steam to buy the game in early access</a> if that's something you'd be interested in.

<p>
This'll be quite a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> experience than you might be used to, though, as this spin-off from the long-running MMO is one of those open world, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, survival crafting kind of games. The Steam page makes it clear that the game is still "RuneScape at its core", as you'll have quests to venture out on, magic to use to craft homes and fight enemies, and there's even some "light RPG elements" too.

It's still a multiplayer experience too, as up to four of you can play together as you set out to slay the Dragon Queen. Oh, yeah, dragons aren't your friends unfortunately, you have to kill them, which I suppose is the traditional thing to do to the scaly creatures. Overall, it looks something akin to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, albeit with that general RuneScapey vibe.
</p>
<p>
In a press release Jagex said they're planning regular updates for the game, with a big focus on "listening closely to the community" - hence the early access release, I suppose. I'm not entirely convinced by how the game looks just yet, I think it'll need a bit more of a hook than multiplayer survival crafting game, but it's RuneScape. The genre's just a bit too saturated these days. I like the sound of there being quests rather than just self-directed play as many games of its ilk tend to be, fingers crossed Jagex leans into that a bit to help Dragonwilds stand out.
