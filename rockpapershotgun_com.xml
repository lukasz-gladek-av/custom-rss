As yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-style roguelite hybrid emerges raging from the volcanic portals of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a>, as the smaller-scale gamedev scene at large threatens to melt into a soup of RNG and deckbuilding, I want you to picture me leaning over you like Samwise Gamgee leaning over Frodo, trying through his tears to remind the Ring-bearer of life back in the Shire, before the horror of Mordor. 
</p>
<p>
"Do you remember the taste of strawberries?" Sam whispers. I do not want you to remember the taste of strawberries. I want you to remember how good it felt to sneak a ball behind the blocks in Breakout. It is the only thing that will save you now.

Ball X Pit isn't just a roguelite hybrid, but a Vampire Survive 'em up to boot. The setup is that a meteor has wiped out the city of Ballbylon (*smiles wanly at camera*) and left a massive hole full of monsters and treasure. You are a treasure-hunter, and the way you gather treasure is to proceed down a slowly scrolling shaft against a wall of block-shaped undead, shooting cannonballs that ricochet from foe and terrain alike.</p>
<p>After breaking enough monsterblocs, you get to choose from power-ups that include weirder, more powerful kinds of ball and a few shmuppy supporting acts, such as little gun-toting NPC statues. There are bosses too, some of which take things in almost a bullet hell direction, with arrows all but filling the screen.
</p>
<p>
I played the now-available Steam demo at a Devolver joint in London the week before last, in a desperate bid to claw back some precious naptime from my SGF schedule. I was dismayed by the rogueliting at first - in case I haven't sufficiently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-review">spelled it out by now</a>, I am really ready for this trend to be over. It's not that Ball X Pit in itself is badly made, it's that everytime I read the word "roguelite" in a press release, I can feel the very substance of my soul dribbling through my fingers. I'm naked in the dark, with nothing, no veil between me and the gameloop of fire.
</p>
<p>
But then I successfully snuck a ball behind the tide of four-cornered fiends, and was Samwisely suffused by recollections of shareware Breakout clones on Apple Macintosh in the 90s. Watching the ball bounce repeatedly between the blocks and backwall, racking up a high score without you having to lift a finger, is the nearest many of us will ever get to nirvana. It may not be enough for me to play/recommend the full thing, but it's enough for me to suggest that you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651790/BALL_x_PIT_Demo/">try the Ball X Pit demo yourself on Steam</a>.

            <p>Sony have confirmed the cancellation of a live service project amid mass layoffs at Sony Bend, the team behind open world zombie biker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Bloomberg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q">reported</a> that Sony Bend were doing away with about 40 people, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">the nuking of an unannounced live service game</a> earlier in the year. Amongst the people affected is former senior animator Robert Morrison, who <a href="https://x.com/RobertAnim8er/status/1932522033335906343">announced</a> his departure on Xitter. </p>
<p>The studio's social media account acknowledged the layoffs, without sharing exact numbers, adding that Sony Bend "remain committed to building the future of Bend Studio with creativity, passion, and innovation in the titles we craft."</p>
<p>Now, Sony have confirmed the departures in an email to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-announces-layoffs-following-live-service-cancellation">Eurogamer</a>. "Earlier this year, Bend Studio wrapped development on a live service concept," it reads. "After careful consideration, we chose not to move forward with it. As the team shifts focus to its next project, we've made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success." </p>
<p>"As part of this transition, a workforce reduction has taken place at the studio," the statement goes on. Again, no hard numbers. According to Bloomberg, Sony Bend now have a new game in the works.</p>
<p>All this continues Sony's on-going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">partial</a> retreat from blockbuster live service productions, which has seen them cancel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">The Last Of Us Online</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">co-op Spider-Man</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">new God Of War game</a> despite 2022-era plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch more than 10 of the things by March 2026</a>. As Brendy wrote in January, when news of the Bend project's abandonment first surfaced, Sony appear terrified by the failure of last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">shut down mere weeks into its shelf life</a> after it failed to accrue figures of sufficient bigness at launch.

</p><p>To quote Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-slams-the-games-industry-layoff-wave-saying-that-bosses-are-making-regular-devs-pay-for-their-screw-ups">an interview in April</a>: "Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?" Best of luck to all affected.</p>
