            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev team is set to grow substantially over the next couple of years, as CD Projekt ramp up development. While most of their ranks right now are on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, a game that's at least made some public cameos even if it's still sans release date, once 2027 rolls around, Cyberpunk 2 looks like it won't be too far behind.</p>
<p>This info comes from the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf">financial report</a>, covering the time running from July 1st to September 30th this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their presentation, CD Projekt interrupted some shouting about the original Cyberpunk continuing to sell well by showing off a developer headcount graph forecasting how they plan to continue "laying the foundations for Cyberpunk 2" across 2026 and 2027. These efforts follow lessons CD Projekt have said they learned from the first Cyberpunk's infamous launch, with <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/cyberpunk-2077-was-a-valuable-lesson-adam-kicinski-on-work-organi/zb3a43">understaffing around the pandemic</a> contributing to in the run up to crunch and more game-centric foibles like the RPG's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cdpr-says-its-new-boston-studio-means-cyberpunk-2-will-be-more-authentically-american/">European-style manhole covers</a> being a symptom of some struggles for a Europe-based dev team to really nail the nuances of an American dystopian city.</p>
<p>As of October 31st this year, the studio says 135 devs are working on Cyberpunk 2. The graph shows Cyberpunk 2's development is split across teams in Warsaw and Vancouver, as well as a bigger group at the newer Boston studio CD Projekt set up specially to work on the sequel. As of these financials, the 135 cited look to mainly be in Boston, with CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">noting</a> that team's around 80 people strong and mostly senior level staff.</p><p>"Having accomplished our goal of building a strong leadership team at its core, we are now shifting to hiring more mid-entry level roles to carry on with pre-production works," he explained. "We plan to expand the Boston-based Cyberpunk team as the project progresses, and double it in the next two years." So, that'd bring the team to about 160-ish people by 2027. Meanwhile, the Canada and Poland-based teams are set to grow, too, so the entire ensemble will swell to just over 300 staff in the same timespan.</p>
<p>The graph doesn't give exact numbers for these planned future headcounts and Nowakowski alluded to wanting to "shift the split" between the two sets of devs to "around 50%" in the same time, making it a bit harder to compare these numbers to the 447 devs currently working on The Witcher 4. As of writing, it looks like the 2027 headcount will fall short of that Witchery number by about 100 devs. One thing Nowakowski added is that the company still strongly believe all the investment they have made and plan to make in adding the Boston studio will "pay off in the future, bringing the next Cyberpunk experience to a new level."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that means the teams working on it will eventually come to surpass the number of people CD Projekt chucked at the original, which a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/fy-2020-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about the company's 2020 financial results I've gone back and dug up cites as having been the work of 530 developers. Cyberpunk 2077 was famously plagued with bugs at launch, so hopefully all this investment will see its sequel avoid the same fate. That might not mean lobbing more devs at it, though, especially given a lot of CD Projekt's spending has been with the goal of just being able to work on Cyberpunk and The Witcher simultaneously, rather than switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Either way, with a more deliberate build-up over these next two years, one would hope the result in a smoother road once the game really starts to gather speed. For now, Nowakowski's "happy with the progress the CP2 team has made so far", but warned "it’s for sure too early to talk about entering any next stage or phase of this project".</p><p>Numbers, eh? For now, The Witcher 4's the thing to keep an eye on release-wise as it's far further along in the pipeline, though Nowakowski has <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">tweeted</a> that it won't be popping up at this year's Game Awards following its reveal at least year's iteration.</p>

            <p>Valve have blocked card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flick-solitaire">Flick Solitaire</a> from the Russian version of Steam, after federal censorship body Roskomnadzor contacted the platform holder to order its removal for "promoting non-traditional sexualities". </p>
<p>In a letter, Valve have also reproached developers Flick Games for failing "to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be". Flick Solitaire is still available in Russia via the iOS and Android storefronts, however, despite Roskomnadzor sending similar notes to Apple and Google. As of writing, Valve appear to be the only platform who have caved to Russian state requests to censor the game.</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from the latest edition of <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, written by George E. Osborn. To start from the beginning, Flick Solitaire released on iOS and Android in June 2020. It's a free-to-play collection of Solitaire variations distinguished by the titular flick controls and some lavish decks from independent artists, which include cards with queer themes such as Amee Wilsons' Queer Chameleon Deck (pictured above) and Ollie T's Drag Deck. I can't say I'm compelled by the familiar option to grind for unlockable decks, or spend real money on in-game coins or a subscription pass, but I do think some of the designs are beautiful. </p>

<p>The game has been available in Russia since its mobile launch - it's the game's second largest market, in fact - though Flick Games demonetised it for Russian players following the Vladimir Putin government's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, to avoid generating any revenue for the aggressor.</p><p>Then, on 1st October 2025, Flick Solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">launched in Steam early access</a>. The developers say they had also demonetised the Steam version for Russian players, while noting that they can't do anything about platform features like store credit that might allow people to get around the block. For context, Steam currently doesn't allow direct purchases by Russian players, in accordance with western sanctions, so Russian buyers have to make use of workarounds such as third-party key resellers.</p>
<p>On 28th October, Flick Games say they received official notices from Roskomnadzor, advising them that they had broken a 2006 law against the promotion of "non-traditional sexualities" - the VGIM article doesn't specify, but I imagine it's referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_anti-LGBTQ_law">this infamous amendment</a> prohibiting the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors. The censor also cc'd Flick Games on emails to Apple, Google and the developers' web host, ordering the removal of Flick Solitaire from their platforms.</p>
<p>According to VGIM's report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's request. Apple acknowledged the censor's letter but assured Flick Games that it "did not affect the studio's standing with the platform", as Osborn puts it. Valve, however, added a country restriction for Flick Solitaire, without giving Flick Games the opportunity to contest or appeal the decision. Here's the text of their accompanying message to the developers, as passed on by VGIM.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Partner,</p>
<p>Your game, FLICK SOLITAIRE (3690460), was determined by Roskomnadzor to be in violation of Russian requirements for distribution. We've added a country restriction to the game so that it no longer appears in Russia.</p>
<p>We also want to remind you that you promised Valve under the Steam Distribution Agreement that your game complies with all applicable laws. Therefore, it is your responsibility to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be.</p></blockquote>
<p>VGIM say they've contacted Valve for a comment on Flick Games's account, but have yet to receive a response. I'll follow up with a request from RPS.</p>
<p>Valve have a track record for restricting access to games on Steam to appease draconian governments. In China, the platform holder operate a separate version of Steam with games licensed by regulators, though a huge number of Chinese players use the international version of Steam to get hold of unapproved releases. Individual cases of Valve bending for Chinese censors include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">the removal</a> of brilliant Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> from sale, after it was found to contain a derogatory reference to the country's president Xi Jinping. As for Steam's operations in Russia, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">boasted in October 2024</a> that they had pushed Valve to remove "over 260 materials containing illegal content", without going into specifics. </p><p>Valve have also been in the headlines lately for delisting or removing a swathe of games with sexual themes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">at the behest of international payment processing networks</a>. Here, as in the case of Flick Solitaire, the platform holder has generally avoided taking a stance on the games in question, preferring to frame it all in the technicalities of compliance with governments or financial institutions, while gesturing towards catch-all prohibitions on "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". Valve are also currently at loggerheads with Italian developers Santa Ragione over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">their refusal to publish the horror game Horses</a>, apparently in response to a scene of a young woman riding a naked slave, though this pre-dates the payment processor crackdown.</p>
<p>Queer people in Russia face enormous oppression. In December 2022, Putin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">effectively outlawed</a> public expression of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by signing a bill against "LGBT propaganda". In June 2023, Russia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-sexologists-target-homosexuality-other-disorders-under-new-rules-2023-06-29/">took steps</a> toward reinstating the idea of homosexuality being a mental illness. It's currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66200194">illegal</a> in Russia for trans people to change their legal gender or receive gender-affirming care. Same-sex marriages or civil unions are also forbidden.</p>
<p>Valve have professed support for queer developers and players on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-now-has-an-official-lgbtq-tag-hub-page">adding a LGBTQ+ store tag in 2019</a> and hosting <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/lgbtq-sale/">LGBTQ+ sales</a> among other events, but these seem like trivial shows of positive optics next to the company's on-going willingness to meet the demands of repressive regimes. I'll update this piece if Valve respond.</p>

<p>That list of changes includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-will-get-a-new-premium-currency-alongside-midnight-for-no-obvious-good-reason-at-all">a new premium currency</a> call Hearthsteel, which you'll need top use to buy a "small fraction" of the house-related bits and bobs being added in with Midnight. Why? Reasons, Blizzard have said.</p>

<p>The date was announced via a fresh trailer, in which old and evil void being Xal’atath has a mid-battle snarky line-off with Lor'themar, the ruler of Azeroth's blood elves. There'll be big void beasties who're well into demonic snarling to battle, as Xal’atath unleashes a Voidstorm that threatens to permanently knock the world's lights off if she succeeds.</p><p>You'll be fighting back, infuriated at the very idea of having to fumble around for switches whenever you leave the new digs the expansion's delivering. To be fair, 'Just go away, I'm trying to pick a carpet which matches my drapes and it's VERY STRESSFUL' sounds like as good a battlecry as any. Three different editions of the expansion will be on offer - base, heroic, and epic - with the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2">date announcement post</a> outlining the extras the latter two include via a big chart.</p>
<p>Outside of the player housing, the update includes a new allied race dubbed the Haranir, a nature-focused gang of humanoids who serve as "ancient guardians of the rootways" in their jungle homeland of Harandar. Harandar's one of four fresh or revamped areas you'll be exploring in Midnight, with the blood elves' Eversong Woods, Amani troll-filled Zul’ Aman and the Voidstorm itself. There are three paths through the main story, with the option to head to Zul'Aman, Harandar, or off on a quest to head off with Arator Windrunner and seek some relics of light all being options after kicking things off in Eversong.</p>
<p>If you're keen to delve into the expansion early, sign-ups for its beta are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/midnight">currently open</a>. Epic edition purchasers get immediate access to said beta as part of their forking over of extra cash.</p>
