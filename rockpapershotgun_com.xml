            <p>Alkahest looks very good.  Emphasis on 'looks' because both trailers released so far have been very scripted. Also, emphasis on 'good' because you get to bully goblins with your feet. It's an open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> boasting a combat sandbox full of the sort of reactive flourishes you might find in an immersive sim. Crucially for fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a> (I've seen the words "spiritual successor" floating about, although not from the devs themselves) one of those touches is a boot. Here's the boot in action:</p>

<p>You seem to have an archer mate, off screen, that you can button-tell to shoot at interactive objects and goblins. We first see this when our character slides up to a cargo lift, then gets catapulted upward when an arrow flies in from nowhere and severs the rope. They then grab a barrel mid-air, before falling back down and braining a goblin with it. I would be very surprised if this is unsynced, impromptu barrel-grabbing. There's probably a prompt that says 'grab barrel', if that. I'd also be a little shocked if the barrel hitting animation transitions into the fire throwing animation, then into the sword fighting animation, anywhere near that smoothly. Still, wishful stitching or no, someone had to animate all that, and they did a fine job.</p>
<p>As for a bit of context for what the game's like outside of combat, here's a trailer from last year:</p>

<p>Plenty of fun stuff in there. Weapon throwing. Wood kicking. Spiky wall advantage taking. Cart skitching. We shoot some oil barrels then light an arrow on fire at one point. We drink a potion then throw the bottle at a goblin, annoying him for just long enough to slip an axe into his neck. Where the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> influence becomes more apparent - and also presumably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkahest">where that name comes from</a> - is mixing and using a metal-heating substance to weaken an iron door before smashing through. Again, if this can be used to eg: render goblin weapons into useless melting slag-pops, rather than just being a specific door-based contextual action, I'll be surprised. Happy, but surprised.</p>
<p>Pre-rendered trailers are flaky, impenetrable things - much like armoured croissants - but the game that's being advertised here does look quite special, assuming it actually exists in any recognisable form. Also, it's nice to see all those Moria goblins getting work after that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cybershell.bsky.social/post/3lpoo2zmny22r">damning plot hole</a> was discovered in Lord Of The Rings. There's no release date as yet, but you can suspiciously examine <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3016620/Alkahest/">Alkahest on Steam here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Six One Indie Showcase is a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to video game presentations, but it's certainly working hard to justify itself. Early today the latest showcase was held showing off a huge range of indies, 48 in total, some of them being brand new reveals, others smaller showcases.

<p>
There's honestly too many showcases around these days, to see a show with a lot of games that made me go "oh I'm going to put that on my wishlist" is a treat. So, here's just a few I think you should check out, because I'm just one freelancer on the night shift and I can't do them all, but I'd like you to take a look anyway.
</p>
<p>
First up was a proper reveal of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3239830">Truth Scrapper</a>, the next games from the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-stars-and-time">In Stars and Time</a>. This one's a scrapbooking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> where your memories reset every day, but there's a mystery that you need to solve. Did I mention there's toxic lesbians? Instant winner.

<p>
I've had my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/">Artis Impact</a> for a little while now, an incredibly stylish pixelart turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a world overrun by AI. Sounds a bit too relatable right now, but I'm still in.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1141260/1000_Deaths_Thousand_Deaths/">1000 Deaths</a> is a "gravity-bending 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> where your choices matter", and also a game that looks like graphics card box art from the '90s and 2000s. To be clear, this is the highest of compliments I can hand out.

Okay, this one isn't a game per se, but it does also involve the number 1000. Last year's seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.veryokvinyl.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3PvLKTRCWUK91CwpewlE4CQNnP7ZMmMReUMB9c6eXcMP0Ktst">ridiculously gorgeous looking vinyl</a> set that comes in two versions - one with one set of sisters, one with another. The recent fanzine for the game (which you can download for free on <a href="https://0x0ada.itch.io/blue-communion">itch.io</a>) is getting a physical edition too!

Then we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3414580/Forbidden_Solitaire/">Forbidden Solitaire</a>, a "card-slashing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about unearthing the contents of a cryptic 1995 CD-ROM that should have never existed." This one's for the card game weirdos (I am card game weirdos).

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946390/Jump_the_Track/">Jump the Track</a> mixes choice based visual novels with pachinko, following an ambitious slacker called Sam who doesn't understand why we're supposed to spend our lives working awful jobs while the rich get to live it up.

I think you just need to watch the trailer for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/">GlitchSPANKR</a>, I think any approach I take to explaining it will get it wrong.

And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2681870/Kidbash_Super_Legend/">Kidbash: Super Legend</a>, a very charming and nostalgic-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action-platformer set in a "world of forgotten game characters as a hero with no memory of his past."

The Six One Indie Showcase really did just have what looked like banger after banger, it'll be worth your time to go and <a href="https://youtu.be/adI4uizTYN4?si=VLceKYiRPwY-JyPj">watch the full thing</a> and get wishlisting anything else that catches your eye.
