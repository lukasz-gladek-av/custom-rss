            <p>Grab your dragons and don't forget those quests, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> VII Reimagined demo is set to pop up on Steam this week. It'll offer a taster of the revamped RPG ahead of full release next month, and any progress you make in the demo'll transfer right over, so you don't have to worry about sprinting through early game sections again.</p>

<p>Developers Square Enix and HexaDrive have announced that this demo'll arrive for PC on January 7th, putting out the news alongside the game's intro movie. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not make the same mistake I did and go top watch the intro movie without making sure your headphones are at a suitably reasonable volume. Anyway, the movie shows off the loveably cartoonly 3D facelift Reimagined gives Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, just in case you missed that being revealed during last September's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>While I have zero Dragon Quest credentials with which to offer in-depth judgement, there's an undeniable charm to the new diorama-heavy style in which Akira Toyama's designs have been rendered this time, even if some of the facial expressions occasionally get very weird. Though, this being a cutscene, it seemingly doesn't offer much in the way of showing off the revamped battle mechanics and "significantly streamlined" story Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">have promised</a>, with both of those changes aimed at making things more accessible to newbies and veterans.</p><p>Going back to the demo, in addition to the handy save data carryover, Square Enix revealed that everyone who dips their toe into the demo will be given an outfit dubbed the “Day Off Dress” which Maribel can wear in the full game.</p>
<p>That full release is still penned in for February 5th, 2026.

            <p>CES 2026 is underway in Las Vegas, and while Nvidia have passed on the opportunity to announce any new RTX 50 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> – perhaps in the knowledge that they’d be hurled directly into the raging vortex of an ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component pricing snafu</a> – the tech show has yielded some interesting GeForce news. Namely, there’s a new version of Nvidia DLSS, 4.5, launching today, that promises to sharpen up and boost performance on any RTX GPU.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Its Super Resolution component is a second-generation upgrade to the 'Transformer' upscaling model introduced with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, and on top of the improvements that version made over ye olde Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of dee-ell-ess-esses past, it supposedly benefits from "greater contextual awareness" of the image it’s upscaling at any given moment. Nvidia say this produces higher-res frames with sharper detailing, less ghosting on moving images – a DLSS classic, that one – and generally cleaner, smoother anti-aliasing.</p>
<figure>

<p>Yah, like that.</p>
<p>No details on performance yet; DLSS 4’s Transfomer model was slightly less effective than CNN at jacking up framerates, but then the picture quality upgrade was arguably worth it, so you won’t catch me sobbing into my keyboard so long as DLSS 4.5 keeps the pace. Compatibility doesn’t sound like it’ll be much of a problem, either, as over 400 games will be compatible with DLSS 4.5 via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a>’s DLSS Override tool. The new Transformer model works on all current RTX-branded graphics cards, too – not just the latest RTX 50 series.</p><p>What you <em>will</em> need a 50 series card for is DLSS 4.5’s other major feature, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation. This won’t be out until Spring 2026, so it’s even less of an issue if you just want the new upscaler right this second, but in short, this builds on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation (MFG) by allowing you to set a target FPS – likely one that syncs with the max refresh rate of your monitor – and only producing enough AI-hewn frames to meet that target. Instead of, as in DLSS 4 MFG, sticking to a flat 2x, 3x, or 4x multiplier, though Dynamic MFG can apparently stretch as high as 6x.</p>
<p>While the more widely known (if still Nvidia-supported) flavour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a> has thus far been a litany of unfulfilled promise, intellectual property theft, and weirdly, RAM prices going haywire, the very specific application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in DLSS – and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-redstone-explained">AMD rival, FSR</a> – is relatively benign. Instead of sending a prompt to a power-hungry data centre, where images or text are aggregated from potentially stolen original works, DLSS is trained on a single supercomputer, and its actual generation work is done entirely on your own, probably sub-1000W PC, merely to create frames from data provided by the game it’s currently rendering. Which, obviously, requires the developers’ permission, given they’re the one who integrated DLSS in the first place. I don’t know how widespread confusion between the two genAI styles actually is, but there’s my reckoning, in case you ever wonder why I’m moaning about one while accepting the other.</p>
<p>Still, as a performance tool per se, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation has issues</a>, including ones I fear may be exacerbated by a 6x multiplier. MFG has already shown us that the more generated frames your GPU shoves out, the lower your supply of 'real', traditionally rendered frames. These are the ones you want to truly keep high, as they determine how fluid and responsive a fast-paced game feels in your mousing hand – generated frames only add visual smoothness, not tactile improvements, and in fact increase input lag. I’m not sure I’d ever want to engage 4x, 5x, or 6x frame gen unless I was already getting at least 70-80fps in normal frames to compensate for the reduced responsiveness, at which point, even a 240Hz monitor wouldn’t need such hefty multipliers to max out.</p>
<p>The new upscaler sounds good, though.</p>
