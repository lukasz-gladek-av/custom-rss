<p>Time is ticking down until Geoff Keighley once again emerges from his fleshy cocoon, brushes the Garibaldi crumbs from his suit, and strides onto the stage to bellow his customary challenge of "Who wants some?". We assume he means games, but one day he will nut a developer in the front row and we won't be able to say he didn't warn us.</p>
<p>We're pulling together a quick rundown of everything announced at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a> so you don't need to risk life and limb by straying too close to Geoff's grasping fingers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're planning on staying up for the night, then a fine time shall be had by all who pull up a stool at James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">The Game Awards 2025 liveblog</a>. If, however you'd rather not trade a good night's sleep for an early look at trailers, then head back here tomorrow morning for a full list of everything announced at the show.</p>
<p>For the games we find most intriguing, we will be writing fuller stories which I'll link out to below.</p>
<p>What's that? The Game Awards haven't started yet? You could have fooled me, what with all the…</p>
<h2>Confirmed games at The Game Awards 2025</h2>
<h3>Total War: Mystery</h3>
<p>Those cheeky so and sos over at Creative Assembly held a livestream last week, a right poke in the eye for ol' Geoff. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">It's where they announced Total War: Medieval 3</a> (while also puncturing the excitement by saying it was still years from release). However, to salve Geoff's bloodshot eye, they also teased a big announcement for The Game Awards.</p><p>There have long been rumours of a Total War take on either Star Wars or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-reveal-likely-after-telltale-words-40k-spotted-in-creative-assembly-video">Warhammer 40k</a>. That could well live up to Creative Assembly's promise that "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era."</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest in June, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth main game in the series. Capcom had insisted that it wouldn't star Leon and would instead focus on new character technical analyst Grace Ashcroft. However, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">a leaked cover from earlier this week</a> certainly appeared to show everyone's favourite cop-turned-super-soldier, suggesting that Capcom's pants are a-blazing.</p>
<h3>New Tomb Raider</h3>
<p>Like a Roman emperor tossing another prisoner to the lions in the colosseum, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923">on Monday Geoff threw out a tweet teasing "a look at the future" for Tomb Raider</a>. Out in the world with all that hungry attention on it, someone quickly found the box art and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-the-next-tomb-raider-reboot-project-going-by-alleged-trailer-leak">reveal trailer for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. The trailer was taken down, but reports from those that saw it say it looks like a reboot for the series.</p>
<p>Confirmed game news is all well and good, but what about the more salacious stuff? The grimy things no one wants to stand by ahead of the night? You know what I mean…</p>
<h2>The Game Awards 2025 rumours</h2>
<p>Well, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming is the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake. It looks like it may be ready to eagle dive from the crow's nest with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">a PEGI rating for Assassins's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a> spotted just the other day. Presumably it's too late to rename the project? Something a little less of a mouthful would be lovely.</p><p>Being a Keighley show, Hideo Kojima is often lurking in the wings. With a recent ESRB rating for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach PC release, tonight could be the moment for an on-stage reveal. Maybe with some added director's cut gubbins thrown in?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is likely to win big at the awards tonight, so it would also be the perfect time for the team to reveal their next project. Be it details of an expansion of a tease of something more.</p>
<p>Now, finally, as long as I've been a games journalist, I've been hearing rumours of the imminent reveal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a>. Once again, with the advent of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and new Steam Controller, there's been more buzz about Gordon Freeman once again picking up his crowbar. I want it to be true, but I have no reason to believe it is true. Nor that Valve would announce it anywhere other than their own show. That said, I'm not going to say I'll eat my hat if it's announced, because under everything I remain an optimist.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this post throughout the night and, if all goes to plan, when you wake up tomorrow it will be chock full of trailers and game reveals. If not, well, let us salute my attempt.</p>
