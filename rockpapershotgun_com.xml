            <p>The world is insufficiently clean and sparkly, so here comes Futurlab with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2">Powerwash Simulator 2</a>. The floor-mopping bonanza will release on 23rd October, a few short weeks from now. The release date announcement accompanies one of those satirical "corporate training" videos, commonly used by videogame creators to sneer indirectly at the sad unfortunates trapped in their Skinner boxes. 
</p>
<p>The trailer comments of the sequel's new cleaning tools, for example, that "it all does basically the same thing, but it gives you a false sense of progression, even though you've really achieved nothing". Fine then, Futurlab. I was looking forward to your glorified adult colouring book. I was modestly anticipating the opportunity to absent myself from my personal squalor and while away some hours in your pseudo-therapeutic tribute to Mr Muscles. But now that you've ripped off the mask and explicitly told me that I'm an addled hamster, deserving only of contempt, I guess I'll buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3374840/Piss_Off/">this game about pissing on people instead</a>.

<p>For balance, the developers had plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-devs-tell-us-their-tips-for-real-life-house-cleaning">perfectly polite and genuinely helpful advice</a> to share with us about realworld cleaning in March. They all seem like lovely people. I cannot thank principal data analyst Russel Young enough for that tip about lemons and coffee mugs. I am less trustful of writer Mark Ginbey's comment about throwing ants on the floor.
</p>
<p>Satirical training video aside, the release date email includes a recap of the sequel's new features. Here you go.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer - Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online - all with shared progression.</li>
<li>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift - Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Don't worry - fall damage doesn't exist here.</li>
<li>Multi-Stage Jobs - Just when you think you've finished, surprise: there's more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</li>
<li>Home Base Customisation - Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</li>
<li>Career Mode - Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</li>
<li>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools - Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</li>
<li>Cat Companions - Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"A rare simulator that's focused on fun, not faff," wrote Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) in our original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> review from 2022. "I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is," he urged, stressfully. "This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore." I expect the second game will follow firmly in those soapy bootprints.</p>
