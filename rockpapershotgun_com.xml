            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are planning to release some DLC for the action RPG by March 2026. That's according the latest financial report of FromSoft parent company Kadokawa, which has attached a window to the add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s promo material had already hinted would be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Call out to the people who're deep in the night of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Nightreign's last addition</a> so they hear. Tell them to scrabble around for a light switch so they can read the info. Remind them not to accidentally fondle a big boss as they paw along the walls. Actually, I'm sure they'll remember that anyway, since it's s-oh no.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'll have to start without them. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar</a>, flip to page 16 of the <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">report's presentation</a>, which covers the six month period that ended on September 30th.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware is currently developing ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN DLC (planned for release in FY2025), ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," reads the future outlook section. While it'd be cool if The Duskbloods does end up migrating from Switch to PC in time, the Nightreign DLC's the only bit of that which is relevant to us PC folks right now.</p>
<p>Kadokawa's 2024 fiscal year ended on March 31st this year, so we can expect this Nightreign DLC out by March 31st, 2026. That's assuming everything goes to plan, with the company leaving some delay wiggle room here.</p>
<p>As to what'll be in the DLC, extra playable Nightfarers and bosses seem pretty certain. Beyond that, things get a bit more mysterious, especially given the potential for FromSoftware to lean on bosses from previous Souls games. Given the DLC has a bit more riding on it than the likes of that free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">Deep of the Night update</a>, I'd be fairly surprised not to see new locales or modes to further spice up the loop of killing whichever new bosses arrive alongside some new boss-beater.</p><p>Maybe they'll add in a map based around Newcastle city centre, and the new bosses are large black-and-white-shirted revellers who bellow 'toon' whenever you get close. You could stick a poison swamp next to Eldon Square, it'd be brill. That's what my fingers are crossed for as the wait for next March begins.</p>

            <p>November goes on. The cavalcade of belles, brutes and barons that is Videogaming continues its push through the midnight forest. Spiderwebs wrap the axles of the gala coaches in which the optimates of Ubisoft, Microsoft and EA drink from lavender flutes, turning their bloodshot eyes from the QA staff powering their barrows through the ruck. The faces of the common developers are a moth-eaten ribbon of quiet striving and terrible hope. The guards form a torchlit embroidery. Every so often, a torch goes out, and the wych elms generate new fruits. The stones in the road cant against our strides. The skulls of live service games burst beneath our wheels, and the analysts in the pageant wagons moan that the future lies behind us now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Then, the woods withdraw and we emerge among flowering graves and fallen buttresses - the remnants of a church. The wagons circle and cooking fires spring up in the transepts, as our scouts contemplate the way forward. Five onward roads fan out from a rotten signpost, each named for a day of the week. Some assuredly lead to disaster. The scouts converse in hisses and, failing to agree, turn to you for instructions. Which day do we choose? Which route is safe?
</p>
<h2>Monday 10th November</h2>
<p>The skies above this path appear to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ambrosia-sky">drip ambrosia</a>, the food of the gods, and yet the splashed soil beneath revolts with fungus. The birds creasing the frail sunlight are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809940/Drill_Bird/">drill-tipped</a> and the clouds appear <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/">very changeable</a>. Our wayfinders murmur of a distant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122860/ZATO__I_Love_the_World_and_Everything_In_It/">closed city</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3609980/Yes_My_Queen/">imprisoned queen</a>.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 11th November</h2>
<p>Even as we study this road, our oldest scout - a one-eyed woman in furs with a staff twice her height - is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">possessed</a> by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3906660/Sacred_2_Remaster/">spirits</a> of prog rockers, roused from the neglected graveyard. She regresses to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416100/Goodnight_Universe/">state of infancy</a>, capable only of chanting "all in all, you're just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">block</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467710/Wall_World_2/">wall</a>."</p>
<h2>Wednesday 12th November</h2>
<p>A hard, bare road, and yet the banks are riddled with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">burrows</a> (pictured) that appear surprisingly welcoming, with postage stamp doormats and tinklesome chimneys. The ghosts of Pink Floyd abandon your moon-touched scout. Regaining her senses, she talks cryptically of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/">million layers beneath</a> where swords fly and time stands still.</p>
<h2>Thursday 13th November</h2>
<p>This road is heavily torn and depleted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-aims-to-fill-a-colin-mcrae-shaped-void-and-its-out-in-early-access-next-month">curious wheelmarks</a> that speak of some great contest, beyond the ken of our wagoneers. Their chevronned textures overlap to form the impression - or is it more than fancy? - of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255860/Hymer_2000/">wide eyes and chattering mouths</a>.</p>
<h2>Friday 14th November</h2>
<p>Goblin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/">winds</a> tussle for dominion of this road, but we should perhaps be more worried about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">the muzzle glints and skullfaces</a> that populate the bushes. Sensing your consternation, the scouts propose that we break for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976880/Tea_for_Sana/">tea</a>.</p>
<p>Does this monstrous forest have an outside? There are rumours up and down the train that this is the final November, that the woods are expanding faster than we can travel through them, that the Maw's latest eruption will be endless. Still, keep going. Think no further than the next footfall and the comrades at your elbow. Also, pls share any images, videos or literature you may know of that concern spooky forests. I am reaching the end of my supply of synonyms for "root".</p>
