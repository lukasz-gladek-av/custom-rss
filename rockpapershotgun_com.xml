            <p>Alright, sweethearts. What are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed? Another glorious day feeding the Maw. A day feeding the Maw is like a day on the farm - every update's a banquet, every DLC a fortune, every quarterly earnings call a parade. I LOVE the Maw!

<h2>Monday 8th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Trainatic</a> is about building a teeny train out of candy-coloured gun parts and seeing how far you can chugalong, chugalong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 9th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478050/Road_To_Empress/">Road To Empress</a> doesn't appear to involve any road-building. It's a lush FMV adventure set in Tang Dynasty China.</li>
<li>I hope you've been dusting your anvil regularly, because it's time for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s Legacy of the Forge expansion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 10th September</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have room in your heart for another metriovainglorious, eerily roguelit endeavour, consider <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Katanaut</a>, in which you are a dude with swords aboard a space station full of muties.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Star Birds</a> is about pigeons building spacebases on asteroids, then linking them up into production networks. No muties in these spacebases, but perhaps you find the idea of entrepreneurial space pigeons even more horrifying.</li>
<li>If Road To Empress got you in the mood for more games set in ancient China, here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509970/Celestial_Empire_Prologue/">the prologue for city-builder Celestial Empire</a> (pictured).</li>
<li>I'm pretty sure I read in the weekend wappity that one of you regular is currently binging X4. It's got some chunky <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3778100/X4_Envoy_Pack/">DLC out today</a>.</li>
<li>I'm also pretty sure a non-zero quantity of you are still playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. The first major DLC pack, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596900/Dune_Awakening__Lost_Harvest_DLC/">Lost Harvest</a>, is also out today. It's got a new vehicle and much underground peril.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 11th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has crossed the border into our lands, for better or worse. Randy Pitchford's piano ties aren't going to pay for themselves.</li>
<li>Sweet merciful crap, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">tandem simulator</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 12th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3361510/Coal_LLC/">Coal LLC</a> doesn't look much like your great grand-daddy's coal mining operation, unless he also had wings and carried out excavations with a Gatling gun.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-trolley-solution">The Trolley Solution</a> is a compilation of minigames dedicated to perhaps the most-memed moral quandary.</li>
<li>I am a medium-to-large fan of the temporal platforming shenanigans on show in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081840/Chrono_Gear_Warden_of_Time/">Chrono Gear: Warden of Time</a>, though its connection to the Hololive universe confuses me.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667950/Gloomy_Eyes/">Gloomy Eyes</a> is a Burtonesque chiller in which one playable character can't stand light, while the other needs it to survive.</li>
</ul><p>


All right sweethearts, you heard the man and you know the drill. Assholes and elbows! Warren, come here! Come <em>here</em>.
