            <p>Revived <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y survivabuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> got a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">early access release date of January 13th</a> the other week. However, the team behind it how now confirmed you shouldn't expect to see it hit Steam at that point, with the game's executive director not seeing the need to knock on Valve's pipe-laden door yet and keen to avoid an early access spent drowning in negative reviews.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This comes from the first <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">post adressing frequently asked questions</a> that Hytale's current devs have put out since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">securing the rights to it from Riot</a>. Right off the bat, executive director Patrick 'Lyall' Derbic addressed whether the game'll be hitting the Steam platform.</p>
<p>"No, not initially," he wrote. "We want to spend our time in early access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing. Steam is a great marketing tool, but one that we might never need. This doesn't mean we will never be on Steam - just that we do not see the necessity of it yet."</p>
<p>On one hand, working with a more concentrated group of players you can grill for in-depth thoughts on the game early doors sounds like a good plan, especially since the team have been very clear what folks will be getting on day one will be quite rough around the edges and have lots of room to grow. On the other, there's perhaps an argument that initially ducking criticism from folks outside of those likely already keen on the proposition of Hytale could potentially lead to blind spots in terms of helping it appeal to a wider audience down the line.</p><p>In any case, I'm not a game developer and certainly appreciate the tough task any game nowadays faces in carving out a reputation for itself that can attract eyeballs and avoid being buried amid the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">massive avalanche of games</a> constantly competing for players' hours.</p>
<p>The rest of the FAQ post saw Derbic acknowledge things like the fact the team are working on getting region-specific pricing up and running for "a limited number of countries to start with", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">$20 being the base price worldwide for now</a>. Extra cosmetics will be added, but there'll be no pay-to-win offerings as far as monetisation goes. Finally, pets, animal taming, and fishing are all in the works, but won't be there in January.</p>
<p>The full thing's also worth giving a read if you're unsure about the different permutations of the three different editions of Hytale being sold out of the gate. Derbic and co have also shared the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements">hardware specs</a> you'll need to meet to comfortably get the sandbox up and running on your machine.</p>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">chaos in RAM production</a>, with mass shortages jacking up street prices to are-you-joking levels, now has a major manufacturer casualty. <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">Micron have announced</a> the end of Crucial, their consumer brand for PC memory and SSDs – and likely a familiar name to gaming PC builders who’ve been hooking up their storage drives and slotting in their RAM sticks for decades.</p>
<p>"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments," wrote Micron’s Executive VP and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s a whole bunch of AI data centres cropping up, and Crucial are rudely hogging memory hardware that could be put to more profitable use than merely supplying grassroots interests in computing and games. Important uses! Like generating a thumbnail image of Mr Beast pretending to swim away from a shark, or unilaterally rewriting article headlines in Google Discover so they’re full of incoherent lies. God, you PC people are so selfish.</p>
<p>Crucial RAM and SSD shipments will continue until 2026, though expect the former, especially, to remain at silly-high prices while that data centre demand keeps shortages short and costs in the clouds. Probably worse so than before, now that there’ll be one less company trying to keep stock flowing.</p><p>After February, they’re gone for good, which is a huge shame. Crucial had been making quality, relatively affordable components and storage right up until Micron’s act of filicide, with the likes of the T500 and X9 Pro currently holding pride of place in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">best SSDs</a> list. I’ve even had a few more recent models – the T710 NVMe drive and the external X10 – in my cupboard, waiting for me to find the time to test them. The PC I’m writing this on, and have played games for years with, has a Crucial P5 as its main SSD, and I somehow remember choosing a 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix RAM set for my first DIY build after reading an agreeable review of it in PC Gamer’s then-tiny hardware section.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a pile of to-be-benchmarked components in your house, that’s a lot of hobbyist history to just... end. And for what?</p>

            <p>Access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with federal censorship and media oversight agency Roskomnadzor accusing the platform of distributing content "justifying terrorism" and spreading "LGBT propaganda". According to Russian media reports, the state body said Roblox has become rife with content that can "negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roskomnadzor also cited reports of sexual harassment of children and the sharing of intimate images in their accusations against Roblox. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/04/russias-media-regulator-blocks-roblox-for-justifying-terrorism-and-spreading-lgbt-content">Euronews</a>, Roblox Corporation have issued a response to the ban via a spokesperson. </p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone," this statement reads. "We have a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roblox has faced plenty of criticism over how it protects young players in the last few years, with the US state of Louisiana <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144"> bringing a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a> in August, and Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<p>The company behind the blocky game that's actually many games have responded to this by pushing to limit interactions between minors and adults, introducing measures like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-to-roll-out-facial-age-estimation-technology-for-everyone-after-us-prosecutor-dubbed-it-the-perfect-place-for-pedophiles">mandatory selfie-based "facial age estimation technology"</a>.</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not." Though, checks of this nature <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">haven't always proven to be totally bulletproof</a> when deployed in response to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">the UK's Online Safety Act</a>.</p><p>As far as their accusation of spreading "LGBT propaganda" is concerned, Roskomnadzor have a long history of going after games which they deem to violate the Russian government's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">ultra-conservative views</a>, which have seen draconian laws <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/russia-supreme-court-outlaws-lgbt-movement">carve away the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people</a> in the country. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-block-steam-game-with-queer-art-in-russia-after-state-censor-attacks-it-for-promoting-non-traditional-sexualities">last month</a>, Valve blocked Flick Solitaire from the Russian version of steam, after Roskomnadzor accused the card game of "promoting non-traditional sexualities".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is ditching its Denuvo anti-tamper software as part of developers' Tango Gameworks transition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">working under new owners Krafton</a>. A fresh patch has been released swapping logos to reflect that switch in management, and you'll need to install it before mid-January if you want the game to stay playable.</p>
<p>Krafton, of course, bought up Tango after the studio's former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced plans to shut it down</a> back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> developers Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom creators Alpha Dog Games.</p>

<p>Cue Hi-Fi Rush <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626833?l=english">patch 10</a>, released earlier today. It makes no changes to the game bits of the game, instead mainly handling the admin of crossing out old publisher logos in favour of Krafton ones.</p>
<p>There is, however, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">one key wrinkle</a> it's well worth you being aware of. The patch has removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-the-state-of-drm-in-2020">Denuvo's controversial anti-piracy/DRM software</a> from the game, with support for it set to end in full as of January 16th. As a result of that, Tango make clear that grabbing patch 10 by that date is mandatory, as "significant changes" made to Hi-Fi Rush's "internal system structure" in the Denuevo removal mean that the game'll no longer run without this latest patch installed after that point.</p><p>"Please note that even after Denuvo is removed, the game’s own anti-tampering features will remain active and will not affect normal gameplay," Tango added, just in case you were wondering if the security guards were being permanently dismissed from Hi-Fi's door.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">our review</a> of the rhythm action romp, Hirun Cryer dubbed it "a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming". "The combat system is surprisingly deep and malleable for any style of player and meshing it gently into the musical beat without putting pressure on the player is a deft touch," he continued. "Its writing and characters might leave a little to be desired, especially when compelling narrative beats are so painfully overlooked, but that doesn’t stop the entire package from being a certified banger."</p>
