            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">previously delayed</a> update 2.3 drops tomorrow, July 17th, CD Projekt have revealed in their latest livestream. It's mostly about giving you more options in terms of traversing the world, because adding in a whole metro system post-launch didn't do enough in that regard.</p>
<p>The studio will not stop, even though they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">now making Cyberpunk 2</a>. They've worked with fellow developers Virtuos to add-in some new cars, a taxi system, self-driving cars, and other stuff not related to getting from A to B.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The biggest aspects of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">the update</a>, though, are those aids for exploration. There are three new cars in total - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, the Rayfield Caliburn 'Mordred', and the Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus the game's first customisable motorbike, the Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa. All execept the Aquila come with small quests to complete to unlock them, so it isn't as simple as just buying from a website.</p>
<p>If you get one and don't fancy negotiating the traffic yourself, every vehicle in the game now has an auto-driving feature that'll transport you to your chosen map waypoint. Or, if you fancy taking a robotic cab instead, once you've completed the Delamain quest, you can call him up and request a taxi that'll drive you where you want to go. Sure, it's more immersive than flying through the roof of the map in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">a modded car/plane doing about 1000mph</a>, but is it really better?</p>

<p>These come with a new cinematic camera you can use to look around as you're driven about, and there's an auto-drive wandering mode you can activate if you just want a bit of a tour. That'll be cool to sit back and watch, though Cyberpunk's maybe a bit hardware intensive to be the ideal second monitor screen saver.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of extra crystalcoat and twintone customisation for cars, to ensure you can pimp your ride in whatever fashion you fancy. Then, there's the photo mode, which now offers you more control over the environment, plus access to a wide range of extra characters from the base game and alternate outfits for those characters - the idea being that if you see them wearing something in a quest, you'll be able to have them wear it once the quest is done.</p>
<p>As for technical updates, AMD FSR 4 and 3.1 frame generation support are coming, but you'll have to wait for a driver update at some point soon to be able to use the former. Intel XESS 2.0 and HDR10+ support also arrives with the update, so you can whip that out if you've got the hardware to match.</p>
<p>It's nice to see CD Projekt keep working on the game and adding in stuff players have requested, especially if it can be done via efficient development with help from Virtuos. Keeps us all cyberticking over until we're auto-driven to the sequel.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The next major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> update will make some fairly sizeable tweaks to Firaxis' latest and not, so far, greatest 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim. It'll rearrange the workings of age transitions, with a view to providing a bit more continuity between epochs and helping you finish your to-do list before crossing the threshold. We can expect a new commander, too - Trưng Nhị, sister to existing Vietnamese leader Trưng Trắc. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most significantly, the feature will re-introduce auto-explore mechanics for scouts. This piques my interest, inasmuch as I haven't ever thought critically about auto-explore mechanics, and now that I do, I realise I regard them with a mixture of enthusiasm and spite.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In theory, auto-explore is a boon for any 4X, because 4Xs have big maps and it's a faff to blow away all that fog of war yourself. When playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, especially, I consider my reconnaissance vessels the pick of the flock. In practice, however, I sometimes actually lose more time and attention to auto-explore mechanics, because when I said "explore at random", I did not mean over <em>there</em>, you wally. Obviously you wouldn't begin by heading east: the terrain tiles are far more abundant in POIs over thisaway. Also, don't move too far away because you're a military unit, and I might you need to bonk a bandit camp or escort a settler or something. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a>, in which Civs don't have as many units to play with, I am always triggering auto-explore for a couple of turns, then taking my hero's wrist in vexation when they mope off towards the least promising coastline. I am that terrible faux-delegator who complains of too much work but also won't trust anybody else with the details.
</p>
<p>
I imagine 4X unit designers have spent a lot of time working out how to guesstimate the player's intentions and ensure that the auto-exploration feels sensible. Be ye dev or little people, I welcome your own thoughts on the subject. Introducing some more heavy-handed context-sensitivity helps, in my experience: in Civ 7, auto-exploring scouts will "[prioritize] tile reveals while automatically stopping in range of Discoveries and enemy zones of control".
</p>
<p>
As for the ever-vexatious question of Ages, you'll now get a 10-turn countdown before each Age transition, so you can polish off your objectives. There's also a continuity setting that preserves unit positions, and you can expect leadership relationships to "evolve more smoothly" between ages. The full patch notes will land alongside the update itself, sometime next week.
</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">troubled launch showing</a>, Civilization 7 is... still getting is arse kicked on Steam, with a mostly negative user review consensus ranging from people who played 0.4 hours before noticing the invasive kernel-based anti-cheat, to people who've played 2000 hours and come to the conclusion that they should not have. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">The last big update</a> brought some very big maps, together with Steam Workshop support.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore]]></content:encoded>
