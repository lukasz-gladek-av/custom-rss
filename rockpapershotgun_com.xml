            <p>Right, stop eating your mate for a minute. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s had a big update from developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games, and it adds a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>-esque location for you to scale the cliffs of.</p>
<p>Before you can go mountaineering among the sandy cacti and roaring tornadoes, though, you'll want to put on some suncream. Yes, I know you now do the cannibalism thanks to co-op climber's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch">most recent patch</a>, but you've still got to take your skincare seriously. Come on, at least take a parasol.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mesa biome is Peak's first alternative to its standard Alpine island, with the two set to settle into a rotation once Mesa's had an initial week in the sun. "Explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade," the devs write of what to expect. It appears one of these hidden surprises is waiting for you inside a kiln (nobody tell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2onuBxhafg">the Aunty Donna boys</a>).</p>
<p>You'll be trying not to succumb to the heat, while dodging the likes of whirling tornadoes and tumbleweeds, which the update's trailer seems to suggest are more lethal than you might expect of your average meandering plantlife. That's in addition to the age-old Peak threat of just falling to your death from a great height, something I'd imagine won't be helped by the fact the update adds in sticks of dynamite that you and your fellow climbers can run across and make go boom. Hey, at least you can now point at a fuse whenever someone starts licking their chops at the idea of chewing your fingers.</p><div>

<p>Among the other new items added in are balloons, scout cannons, parasols, sunscreen, and aloe vera. So, it seems the devs have popped into their local health and beauty shop after raiding Wile E. Coyote's ACME surplus. Armed with this stuff, you're tasked with earning a bunch of new badges that dish out fresh gear.</p>
<p>The Mesa update also adds an optional no-insects mode for creepy crawlyphobes, makes some performance improvements, and dishes out some bug fixes. Among the latter are tweaks that prevent legs getting stuck in luggage, as well as one that stops you fiddling with your backpack after you've passed out.</p>
<p>"A lot of you are asking about future updates and to be as honest as possible - we aren't quite sure yet," Aggro Crab and Landfall wrote to close out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710?l=english">the update's notes</a>. "We don't want to promise a bunch of stuff and not deliver. BUT we will continue to update the community on what we're cooking as soon as we can. At this stage, keep expecting bug + stability patches for now!"</p>
<p>Right, off you go to climb those buttes. You'd better not come back glowing pink or your mum'll be furious.</p>

            <p>While admitting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s launch on Steam "underperformed", developers Remedy have re-iterated their commitment to the co-op shooter in their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">latest financial report</a>, saying that it remains "a solid game to build on" and confirming that a previously announced major update will arrive in late September.</p>
<p>The report also gives quick mini-updates on the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the combined <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payne 1</a> &amp; 2 remake, both of which remain on course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Remedy CEO Tero Virtala, Control spinoff Firebreak enjoyed a launch that "succeeded technically" and attracted plenty of players on console. However, it "underperformed" on Steam, which had been pegged as the storefront through which it would attract most of its PC players. The overall result was launch sales that left the studio "unsatisfied", and have seen the game rely on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to prop it up out of the gate.</p>
<p>However, Remedy's commitment to updating and and improving Firebreak isn't faltering, and the studio are reportedly pleased with feedback to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-bit-of-a-rough-launch-remedy-promise-that-fbc-firebreak-improvements-are-on-the-way">the changes they've already made</a>, citing a turnaround in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">review sentiment</a> as updates have arrived. "FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," Virtala said, "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on." Firebreak's first major update, which Remedy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536607976683733002">first teased last month</a>, is set to arrive in late September and bring a new job (aka mission) with it.</p><p>Remedy have consistently maintained their public-facing support for the shooter, and it's encouraging to see that hasn't changed now that they've had to explain its rough launch to the money types. After all, the need to make spreadsheets look and presentations sound as dollar-sign-heavy as possible is leaving an awful lot of games that won't provide immediate runaway successes (or need a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">long-term push to get them where they want to be</a>) facing the chopping block. That's been doubly true for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">multiplayer games which suffer difficult releases</a>.</p>
<p>As for Control 2 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a>, the former is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", with "the gameplay, environments, and missions" being the big focus of its development right now. Meanwhile, the Payne remake is still in the full production phase, with Remedy making sure they keep working closely with collaborators Rockstar as the game approaches a "next major phase". Sales-wise, the studio say both Control and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still ticking away nicely, with the rights to the former having now transferred fully into Remedy's hands.</p>
<p>So, all eyes towards that big September update for Firebreak, and the job Remedy do in continuing to revamp their game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">designed not to be a second job</a>, despite containing jobs.</p>
