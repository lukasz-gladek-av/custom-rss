Marshal, if my hastily scribbled, made-up blackboard equations are correct, we should witness a double event within the next year or two. No, not a double kaiju event. A double kaiju clean-up event. Somewhat to my surprise, job sims in which you dismember dead Godzillas are a thing, now. And by thing I mean that there are at least two of them on the way. 
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be a battle for the ages. Alien vs janitor: whoever wins, we… get to walk around outside without stepping on in puddles of Mothra bile. Please, sir, join me next to this second blackboard full of hastily scribbled, made-up equations while I slap them haphazardly with a cane and shower everybody in spittle.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
On the left here we have Kaiju Cleanup from Brightrock Games and publishers Mythwright. As you can see from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729700/Kaiju_Cleanup/">the Steam page</a>, Marshall, it’s a satirical fantasy in which you are play a clone butcher, carving up monsters and disposing of their radioactive, acidic or explosive wibbly bits using claws, hoovers, sprays and energy beams. Complete missions and you’ll get the means to upgrade your equipment and customise your base, van, and outfit. Fail and you’ll have to mop up your own corpse.</p>
<p>Along the way, there’s the chance to investigate the origins of the kaiju by collecting audio logs, consulting your codex, speaking to colleagues, and sifting nuggets of total truth from totally truthful radio station InfoBlast. Let us watch the trailer, Marshal. Please pull that lever on the left there. No, not my left - oh god. Never mind, I'll fix it later. Here, permit me.

By itself, Marshal, the existence of Kaiju Cleanup would be a severe but manageable crisis, perfectly within the scope of a single news article. But Marshal, if this print-out I’m waving rapidly before your face isn't just a random Tescos receipt I've swiped from the trash, the creatures are <em>multiplying</em>.</p><p>Please kindly join me next this third blackboard covered in hastily scribbled, made-up equations, while I pop my monocle and furiously fan myself with a pocket handkerchief. Do you see this arcane chalk diagram? It’s actually the URL for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3688110/Kaiju_Cleaner_Simulator/">the Steam page</a> for Kaiju Cleaner Simulator, which, <em>if you can believe it</em>, Marshal, is <em>also</em> a game about cleaning up dead kaiju. 
</p>
<p>
In the interests of time – no time, no time! – I will focus on what it does differently to Kaiju Cleanup. Firstly, it’s got co-op for up to four. Secondly, it seems both more slapstick and a little more gruesome. You can slice through layers of Rodan offal with actual chainsaws, and kick King Ghidorah hearts around like this is something a normal, well-adjusted person would do.</p>
<p>This one seems to be more about Top Larks with the Boyz than satire, and they’re making a very big deal in the marketing materials of it not having any generative AI. Do you see that large scarlet red button labelled "Trailer" in front of you, Marshal? Press it please. NO, not the crimson one. No, not the cerise one either. Never mind, I can reach it with my cane.

One kaiju clean-up game, Marshall, may be regarded as a novelty; two looks like a subgenre. I can only speculate as to the causes. Possibly this is all displaced guilt about factory farms. Possibly a couple of sleepless designers watched Kaiju No. 8 at approximately the same time. Possibly this is just the usual creative mitosis where somebody works out that one toolset (cleaning sims) can fit a multitude of subject matters. Possibly it's just an accident. I hate those.</p><p>Regardless, we can only hope that the two kaiju cleaning games pour their energies into defeating each other and leave the rest of us unscathed. We can only hope that they don’t learn to work together. Oh great Scott! Please don't let them do a collaboration with the already existing C<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">o-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a>.

            <p>
I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a majority of the data that various AI models train themselves on do so without getting any sort of permission to do so. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, as they say, though in the case of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, they probably shouldn't have taken that lesson to heart. That's because Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) has requested that the AI developer stops using Japanese media to train its text-to-video model Sora.
</p>
<p>
A touch of context: CODA is a Japanese trade association that represents some of the biggest media businesses in the country. It has a big focus on anti-piracy measures, particularly to do with anime and manga, but in general is about protecting the copyright of Japanese media. You'll be no stranger to some of the names on the list, as it includes the likes of Bandai Namco and Square Enix, as well as for anime companies like Toei Animation and Studio Ghibli.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that request! In a <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">post shared last week</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">Eurogamer</a>), CODA wrote that they have "confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images. CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data."
</p>
<p>
It goes on to note that Sora 2 operates on an opt-out system, meaning a company has to put in a request if it wants its intellectual property removed from the dataset. The issue is that Japan's copyright system doesn't work like that, as you need to get consent before you use any copyrighted works.
</p><p>
CODA's requests are twofold. First, "In the operation of Sora 2, CODA requests that its members’ content is not used for machine learning without their permission," and second, "OpenAI responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."
</p>
<p>
I feel it's important to note that this isn't saying CODA or any of the companies they represent are anti-AI, and that this is more a concern over the use of their respective bits of copyright. Even before AI, you've likely seen fan games and the like receive takedown notices because of their potential to misrepresent a particular work. But something like Sora 2 allows this to be done at scale, so even if you and I know that copyright just exists to protect the interests of big businesses, you can at least see why this is being done.
