            <p>
Keep your hands at 10 and 2, drivers, as Ironwood Studios has just offered up a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive's</a> first big expansion, Whispers in the Woods. Where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game has a sort of Stalker-but-you're-in-a-car kind of feel, this DLC looks like it's fully leaning into some horror vibes. The first half of the trailer has some real '70s era, found footage horror vibes, which feels laser targeted at my artistic proclivities.
</p>
<p>
It's sounding like a pretty meaty expansion too. According to the DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam page</a>, the full thing runs between 8-12 hours long, with the whole thing fully voiced, complete with new characters and "additional side narrative to discover." I'm quite fond of this ominous line describing the expansion's plot: "They have come to the Zone and left their mark. Travel into the whispering woods of the OEZ - a disturbing vision of the once familiar forests."

<p>
There's new maps and junction types to be found, some fresh parts and cosmetics to kit your car out with designed by this mysterious group, and of course more anomalies and anomaly behaviours. The big addition that's coming with Whispers in the Woods is a new gameplay system called Artifacts. These are mysterious objects that change and affect both you and the world itself, adding a bit of challenge while also being something you'll need to use to not be sent to the scrap heap in the sky.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's more garage stations, route modifiers, garage cosmetics, and a new lot of music from composer Wilbert Roget II - great name by the way.
</p>
<p>
No release date on the expansion, but it is slated to arrive before the end of the year. And the base game is 50% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">Steam</a>, so now seems like a great time to head out for a test drive.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.
