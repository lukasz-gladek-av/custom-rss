There's a lot we still don't know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, but probably the most annoying thing that has gone unanswered is just when it's coming out. Not annoying in the sense of, "oh golly gosh I'm so excited please I need to know", more "come on now, just get it over with!" It's just a whole thing, and I wish it wasn't, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockstar">Rockstar</a> and their owner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two</a> also clearly know it's a whole thing, and are riding on that very fact. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke with Bloomberg about a whole bunch of bits, and of course the question of when GTA 6 is coming out came up.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Doubly of course, Zelnick didn't give a definitive answer, but he did give the exact kind of response a CEO would give. "The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times," he said. "We want to maintain the anticipation." Speaking of "competitors" who lay out their release schedules quite plainly, Zelnick said that they "found that the better thing to do is provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window".

<p>
Translation? A release date isn't being shared probably until the summer or so, given that Take-Two have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">expressed confidence in meeting a fall release window</a>. And as game devs everywhere read this, I can hear them all saying "cripes, when the hell can we even release our game?" Alright, maybe they wouldn't say cripes, but you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
A recent report from the newly established site <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">The Game Business</a> claimed that multiple major publishers have plans in place to deal with the release of GTA 6, because they all fear that it would completely obliterate anything released close to it (a fear they're right to have). Now just imagine trying to be an indie dev with a game out this year. I shudder at the thought, glad I'm this side of the fence.
</p>
<p>
All of this doesn't matter much for readers of RPS though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">given that GTA 6 won't be available on PC at launch</a>, and will likely come a bit further down the way. Which, now that I think about it, is just another release date other devs will likely have to avoid. Just a bit of a lose-lose situation, isn't it?

            <p>
We can probably all agree that planting trees is pretty much universally good, right? I can't really imagine a scenario where planting a tree is a bad thing, we need them to live after all. If you're not into planting trees you're probably an oil tycoon, or a squirrel with incredibly bad survival instincts. If you are, though, might I interest you in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531490/Treeplanter/">Treeplanter</a>, a game whose name is exactly what it says on the tin? It was announced just yesterday, and looks quite, quite lovely.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Treeplanter doesn't exactly appear to be a traditional game, more something in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mountain">Mountain</a>, where the priority is lovely, naturey vibes. Described as an "interactive woodland", you grow little landscapes and ecosystems where over time plant life grows, and animals flock to. It's the kind of thing I can imagine spending 15 minutes on at the end of a tough day to help recuperate. 
</p>

<a aria-label="Treeplanter - Announcement Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXsxn1OWxM0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Most appealing of all, though, is the fact that proceeds from every sale of the game will go straight to tree-planting charities to help grow actual trees. This isn't surprising given the person who made it, Henry Driver, is apparently a sixth-generation farmer alongside being a game developer. Talk about living up to your name!
</p>
<p>
In particular I quite like the final line from the game's Steam page: "Please keep in mind that this is a small game with no goals or challenges, created by Henry with help from his friends - it's all about creating small but beautiful dioramas, using the tools and items from the game alongside the influences of nature." I'm not big on traditional sim games myself, but this sounds up my alley.
</p>
<p>
Treeplanter doesn't have a release date just yet but it is set to arrive sometime in 2025.

Look, not every dating sim under the sun is insatiably horny, but I don't think you can argue that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> isn't. Like, the whole game is about how you can date everything, from a chair, to a clock, to a fridge. There's literally 100 different objects you can date, this is somebody's something for sure. And, as revealed in a new trailer earlier this week, as it turns out all you tabletop fiends out there will be able to date a twenty-sided die. 
</p>

<p>
Surprising literally no one, Chance, as the anthropomorphic D20 is known as, is voiced by Critical Role star and prolific voice actor Matthew Mercer. Who could have seen that coming! Chance looks to be exactly what you might envision a guy that loves Dungeons &amp; Dragons a bit too much - a bit of a bumbling buffoon, way too happy to go into detail, and perhaps a bit too eager to play with someone.

Following up a request to play the game's version of the popular TTRPG (dubbed Grottos and Gargoyles, that's a new one) he does express that eagerness quite plainly by saying "it would only be the single greatest thing you could do for me", which is killing my vibe a bit personally. But hey, just because you can date everything, doesn't mean you should, right?
</p>
<p>
Mercer's involvement is no surprise, given that the game is being developed by prolific voice actors like Ray Chase (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>), Robbie Daymond (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Sailor Moon), Max Mittelman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth), and Amanda Hufford (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>). Not to mention there's other voice talent like Felicia Day (Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (The Last Airbender). A bonafide feast for people that like to play/ watch things and go "wait I definitely know that voice, let me check IMDB."
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but it's due out this June.

Bah, it's never fun writing one of these, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cyan-worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> have laid off 12 of its staff members this week, supposedly cutting the studio by about half. Cyan shared the news on its social media accounts yesterday, noting that "industry conditions" have "forced" the studio to "weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post also states that it has been communicating with the entire team about the "choppy waters" it has been in, and that the layoffs weren't a surprise for the team, so it sounds like it has been a long time coming. At the very least those affected will be getting severance packages, but I imagine that's not quite enough consolation. Also worth noting is that the studio's current priority is to "secure financing for our next project."

Cyan are a long-running developer, having been founded almost 40 years ago. They're obviously best known as the studio behind Myst and Riven, having focused on remakes of both titles in recent years. The latter was just released last year, and was broadly well received, so you have to wonder what went wrong. Plenty of indie studios are struggling to find funding at the moment, but it's not always as simple as something as that, as we all know. For what it's worth, Cyan did also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyan.com/post/3llhcingbwb27">provide a list of employees impacted by the layoffs</a> to help them get new work.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope Cyan manages to pull through, and that all the laid off staff manage to land on their feet. Honestly, I can't think of another developer with half as much history, let alone 37 years of it. Fingers crossed for all those involved.

Have you been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>? Not like, literally, everywhere, but Everywhere, that sort of Roblox, sort of Fortnite, everything game from Build A Rocket Boy, a studio founded by ex-Rockstar dev and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies. That whole, uh, interactive experience or whatever you want to call it still seems to be in beta. But the first project spun off from it, MindsEye, a near-future action game that really just looks like slightly sci-fi GTA, now has a release date: June 10th, later this year. Except, I'm a little bit confused by it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
MindsEye was first formally revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-boss-unveils-mindseye-a-new-blockbuster-available-in-robloxlike-everywhere">back in 2023</a>, and was meant to, firstly, be episodic, and secondly, be available in Everywhere. As it currently stands, though, it looks like you'll be able to pick it up on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox solo. The game's <a href="https://ioi.dk/MindsEye">official website</a> makes no mention of Everywhere, nor does its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/">Steam page</a>, which is pretty sparse overall. Hell, one of its key selling points is that you're meant to be able to use all the assets featured in MindsEye to make your own games in Everywhere, but I have no idea if that will be possible now.

<p>
This latest trailer introduces you to the city the game takes part in, but it's all cutscenes, and the only gameplay trailer that's been released was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSn42TbRngY&amp;ab_channel=MindsEye">from a month ago</a>, which doesn't really show you how it plays, outside of looking like a GTA clone. Sure, there's a release date, but this thing feels like borderline vapourware.
</p>
<p>
It could always be that publisher IO Interactive (you know, those folks that make Hitman) wanted Build A Rocket Boy to get something out the door to start bringing in some money. That would just be conjecture though, don't hold me to it. Honestly, I'm a bit baffled by this whole game. I'll be on the lookout for one of those lengthy walls of text explaining how the game has been delayed because the devs really want to polish it up so you can have the best experience.
</p>
<p>
I should also mention that there were some concerns over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-devs-respond-to-nft-speculation-saying-its-built-on-unreal-engine-5-not-the-blockchain">Everywhere utilising blockchain technology</a>, in no small part thanks to the fact that Build A Rocket Boy was literally hiring for people to join its blockchain team. The studio claimed Everywhere wouldn't be using it, and that it was just for research purposes. I can't see any evidence of it in MindsEye right now, but I'd probably hold off on pre-ordering this one all the same, given its mysterious, slightly off-putting vibe.
