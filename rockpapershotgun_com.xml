            <p>The privitisation of British Rail, now that's the <em>real</em> monster. Please subscribe to my Substack for more scorching social commentary. Actually, here's a far more fun thing you can click on: a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a>. If you ignored the ennui-drenched tannoy announcement because you were paying sixteen pounds at Cafe Nero for a limp panini last time around, Monster Train is a card flickenin' roguelite strategy, and one of the better ones, too. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> breezed into my life like a man wearing a trenchcoat stuffed with cocaine," wrote Matt (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">his review from 2020.</a> "I've been playing Shiny Shoe's roguelike deckbuilder almost every night since, and I have no intention of stopping. Monster Train is at least as good as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>."</p>
<p>The full game is "leaving the station later this year", say developers Shiny Shoe. Easy on the low hanging puns there, please. I'll be out of a salary and the single off-peak return it allows me to buy every two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
