            <p>Generative AI has played "zero part" in Rockstar Games' creation of GTA 6, Take-Two CEOman Strauss Zelnick has said at the company's latest financial numbers get-together, where he also indicated the game's still on to initially release this November. Well, on consoles at least. Though, back in the AI front, the Z bloke also revealed that Take-Two have "hundreds of pilots and implementations" on the go involving the tech.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"On the topic of AI, I've been enthusiastic since the very beginning," Zelnick told RPS' ironed dress shirt-wearing corporate acquaintances at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">GamesIndustry.biz</a> in a chat around Take-Two's latest earnings call. "This company's products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence. We've actually always been a leader in the space, and right now we have hundreds of pilots and implementations across our company, including within our studios. And we're already seeing instances where generative AI tools are driving costs and time efficiencies."</p>
<p>That said, the exec did make sure to stick to his established line on the controversial tech, emphasising that he sees it as a tool rather than some infernal magic box from which fully-formed creative projects can spew. "Do I think tools by themselves create great entertainment properties? No, there's no evidence that that's the case and it won't be the case in the future," he continued. "Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That's what differentiates them."</p>
<p>This latest round of questions being pointed at Zelnick about AI follow Google's deployment of Project Genie, an AI prototype that lets people generate "interactive worlds" which work like playable games. Well, if by playable games you mean utterly shite clones and/or two minute glorified GIFs of a character walking around. Project Genie's rollout led the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/numerous-video-game-company-share-prices-dropped-following-googles-project-genie-ai-rollout/">share prices of a number of game companies</a> - including Take-Two and Witcher developers CD Projekt - to drop, one would assume because plenty of shareholders and other money men are brainless fools who don't know what goes into making games.</p><p>Hence Zelnick and many of his exec kinspeople adopting positions which hedge their bets when it comes to adopting this sort of tech as a magic bean with the word' efficiency booster' written on it in crayon, if not a magic bean that does the whole job. At least GTA 6 appears to be packing none ahead of its initial arrival on November 19th.</p>
<p>Not that the game's without bubbling controversy. Legal proceedings between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">Rockstar and the developers they fired last year</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">rumble on</a>. The company have accused the fired staff of leaking info about the game, while the staff and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union have accused Rockstar of union-busting.</p>

            <p>Here is a question for the septuagenarians and older in the RPS readership, assuming any of you are that venerable: if some chortling time traveller had told you back in the 50s or 60s that the perpetually sizzling terror of nuclear apocalypse would one day become a nostalgic playground for videogames with two-headed cows and dogs named Dogmeat and swaggering cowboy zombies, what kind of period-appropriate blunt implement would you have clobbered that time traveller with?
</p>
<p>While you grizzled boomers get your gums into that vexing proposition, here's the trailer for AtomTeam's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg-2">Atom RPG 2</a>, the floridly titled sequel to 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg">Atom RPG</a>. It's another turn-based, top-down affair in the spirit of the original Interplay-published Fallouts, and appears rich in bunkers, action points and raging, possibly mutant bears. It's also the work of a team based across Cyprus, Ukraine and Latvia, who probably have very different ideas about the nature and duration of the Cold War than the people behind Fallout.

<p>"ATOM RPG 2 is a story-heavy tactical CRPG set in a world where the Cold War turned hot," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3429280/ATOM_RPG_2/">the Steam page</a>. "Explore a living open world with vertical level design, tactical battles, and an interactive world map. Take part in numerous side activities: such as fishing, building, racing, and more, while expanding your influence and control over the land. Remember: your choices not only shape a resurrecting civilisation, but may also prevent a new apocalypse looming on the horizon... "
</p>
<p>For context, maybe read Sin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atom-rpg-trudograd-is-about-a-third-of-a-game-but-a-great-third">write-up of the original Atom RPG's standalone city expansion Trudograd</a>. She quite liked it, despite being unimpressed by the combat. She was more keen on the quest design and writing. An excerpt:
</p>
<blockquote>I've talked a writer into walking into a minefield. I gained a level after listening to some old women ramble on a bench. I've sucker-shot a top hatted millionaire with a crossbow, then taken a pastry of his corpse and eaten it. At one point during an interesting, text-based side mission that reminded me of the weird text adventure bits of Space Rangers 2, I failed to bluff a common guard, alerting a whole base to my presence, but subsequently bluffed his boss into surrendering the entire base without a fight.</blockquote>
<p>Developers AtomTeam are also the people behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108180/Swordhaven_Iron_Conspiracy/">Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy</a>, which as you may guess, is more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> than Fallout, and emphasises lizards over bears.</p>
<p>Ho, rickety veterans of the Duck and Cover era! Have you decided what you're going to hit my hypothetical Tardis pilot with yet?</p>
