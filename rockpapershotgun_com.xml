            <p>
Fancy a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> in your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>? Oh, well that's convenient, as the game's Nightmare and Visions update just dropped today, adding in Mortis Trials, a new wave-based game mode. The wave-based nature really is what it says on the tin: scores of enemies come after you round after round, but in this mode you'll get Indulgences, which is just lorespeak for upgrades you can unlock on different runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You'll also start with an archetype that lets you deal elemental damage like electricity or fire, while doing more damage to electrified or burning enemies. Another archetype simply lets you switch or reload weapons faster, and you get a second small buff for the second wave (there's a total of 12 to get through, which doesn't sound easy, but I suppose that's the point). There are also objective waves that take place on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th waves, but you'll have to play to find out what those are like.

Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fatsharkgames">Fatshark</a> released the <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/nightmares-visions-patch-notes">full patch notes</a> for the new update earlier today too, and if you want me to list out every single change, you can jog on, because it's massive. There are a few changes I'll highlight though, just to help you out a bit. For one, Havoc is receiving campaigns, with plans to release new ones with "different mutators and a rotating mission pool" alongside major updates.
</p>
<p>
There's some quality of life changes too, like DLSS 4 support now being a feature in the game, and there's been a bunch of weapon balance tweaks too - possibly worth having a closer look at if your weapon of choice has been affected.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth noting that Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">half off on Steam right now too</a>. Quite convenient with this new update, 'ey?

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-co-founder-opens-new-studios-with-loads-of-ex-blizzard-folks">Back in 2020</a>, co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> Mike Morhaime formed Dreamhaven, essentially Blizzard 2, albeit a bit more explicit in the fact that it has different studios working under it. One of said studios, Secret Door, is currently working on co-op strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunderfolk">Sunderfolk</a>, and today as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k&amp;ab_channel=thegameawards">showcase</a> presented by The Game Awards, the other studio Moonshot Games revealed its first title: Wildgate, a sci-fi shooter that sees you piloting ships around space looking for loot as you face off against other players.
</p>

<p>
The way it works is that in each match, you and crews of other players are after an artifact, each of you with your own ship you use to get to your destination. Sometimes you'll have to use said ship to fight against other players, though while the reveal trailer offered a look at space combat, it wasn't too detailed. It looks like all the ships have shields and turrets to shoot at each other with, and you can even disembark your own ship to go and board an enemies' one. Looks pretty neat honestly! Not sure how I feel about it being match based, but hey, can't win 'em all.

<p>
Your crew is made up of prospectors, like that one guy voiced by Kelsey Grammer in Toy Story 2, all of which have different abilities and tools, typical hero shooter kind of thing. It looks like there's a few different gun options, and even tools to put out fires on your ship. 
</p>
<p>
Again, it doesn't look like there's necessarily anything massively unique on the shooting front, there's only so many different ways you can do a shooter, but it looks fun enough, and I like the character designs. One prospector looks like some kind of axolotl thing in a fishbowl with robot limbs? That'll probably be my main day one.
</p>
<p>
Wildgate doesn't currently have a release date other than sometime this year, i.e. 2025, but you can <a href="https://playtest.playwildgate.com/signup/communitypreview/account">sign-up to playtest it</a> if the trailer piques your interest.
