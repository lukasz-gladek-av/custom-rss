            <p>The American Federal Trade Commission has given out a further $126 million (around £91 million) in refunds to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who've been "charged for unwanted purchases", bringing the overall total issued so far to about $200 million. It's also given eligible players who're yet to submit a refund claim some extra time to do so.</p>
<p>These refunds are the ongoing fallout to a pair of complaints made to the FTC over Fortnite, which Epic opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-settle-fortnite-privacy-and-purchase-complaints-for-520-million">settle in late 2022</a> by paying a combined total of $520 million (£427 million). Epic were accused of breaching the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting data on under 13 Fortnite players without parental consent, and deliberately using tactics such as confusing button placements intended to push folks into buying cosmetics from the Fortnite store unintentionally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The latter of those is what these refunds from the FTC are being issued to remedy, with $245 million of the settlement gradually being given out to affected players in the US. This <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims">latest $126 million wave of refunds</a> is the second one, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement">the first</a> having totalled over $72 million and been issued in December 2024.</p>
<p>The FTC says it's sending out "969,173 checks and PayPal payments" across June 25 and 26 this time around, so it's worth taking a look in those two places if you submitted a claim, as the body encourage cashing or accepting it within 90 days or 30 days respectively. They also note that claims made later than February 14, 2025 are still being reviewed.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process. Players who have not already filed a claim will now have until July 9 to submit one: <a href="https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z">https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z</a></p>— FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you're in America and meet the rest of the criteria <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds">outlined here</a>, you can still apply for a Fortnite refund for a little while longer, with the FTC having reopened claims until July 9.</p>
<p>Games should go above and beyond to make sure players even more clearly understand when they are making a purchase with real money or with virtual currencies to prevent accidental purchases," Epic wrote in a statement issued about the settlement back in 2022.</p>
<p>"We don’t want players to pay for something that they did not intend to," they continued, "Since May 2018, Fortnite has had a refund token system and an undo-purchase system, but now we've gone further. We’ve updated our payment flows with a hold-to-purchase mechanic that re-confirms a player’s intent to buy, as an additional safeguard to prevent unintended purchases alongside instant purchase cancellations and self-service refunds."</p>
<p>Here's hoping everyone affected gets the refund they deserve.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-players-receive-126-million-more-in-refunds-from-the-ftc-over-epics-deceptive-billing-practices]]></content:encoded>

            <p><em><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> in a tree (hey!). Frostpunk in a tree (hey!). The temperature is fine but monsters all want to eat me (hey!) </em></p>

<p>Sorry, not sure what happened there. My doctor tells me I need to keep these occasional flare-ups of unbridled jauntiness under control or I'll sprout hat tassel bells and jig myself into an early grave. "But doctor!", I replied. "<em>I am</em> Frostpunk in a tree. I mean, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkswitch">Darkswitch</a> <em>is</em> Frostpunk in a tree". Also it's bloody depressing and I need to keep the mood up. Nothing else for it. Time to bring back a perennial audience favourite. Here's a tray-tray.</p>

<p>Developer Cyber Temple were kind enough to send me a preview build. Pre-warning: I only played an hour, because I didn't enjoy it very much. So, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3132870/DarkSwitch/">Steam sell</a> in case you want to ignore my opinions and just pop it on the wishlist for the inevitable demo - something I always heartily recommend.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Gather resources, research technologies, and send pioneers to explore the ruins of those who came before: discover their secrets and doom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set in a world of folk horror and creeping dread, DarkSwitch blends vertical city-building, tower defense, and exploration into a unique strategic experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navigate a stunning, dangerous, dark fantasy world enriched by cinematic cutscenes and an atmospheric soundtrack from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Opinion the first, they only get worse: Akira Yamaoka is phoning it in. The music is pleasant and richly layered but nothing to write home about, unless perhaps you haven't spoken to your family in yonks and need a very tenuous coversation starter. Ah well! You play as a colony of elves and their architecture is suitably Rivendallian. Being elves they think they know it all and don't bother giving you much onboarding. This where the issues start. A style over substance UI. Exclamation points appear over buildings with no indication of what they mean. There's a counter down the right hand side of the screen, no tooltips or other explanations, ditto the 'Fear' counter in the top right.</p>
<p>The tutorial, such as it is, tells you <em>what</em> to do, but not how to do it. Not too tricky to work out, usually. But crucially, you're not told <em>why</em> you're doing it either. My people are hungry so I need to collect mushrooms, I can work that out. But what am I placing two 'flame guards' down? A tooltip tells me they have something to do with the fog that creeps in at night, and my citizens, but I'm given no further explanation and no indication of where to place to them. And the more crucial thing here is, since the game seems to be working backwards in terms of goals and motivations, there's little of Frostpunk's demanding energy or intrigue. I eventually peace out after digging in every menu for a tutorial-demanded building extension I just can't find.</p>
<p>Also, look. I've previously bemoaned the state of latent paranoia that the proliferation of AI art encourages, turning us all into little art purity witchhunters whenever something <em>might</em> be machine generated. All I'm saying is, if I perhaps wanted to avoid such speculation, I would not have gone for this particular look with the character portraits:</p>

<p>Apologies to Eldric Flambet. And that said, I really like how this wooden walkway automatically connects between buildings, and also how you can build structures on the trunk of the tree itself, Ewok style:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I do still think the concept is really compelling. The writing is terse and veers simple but does its job. Some culty flamemen called Luminarchs show up in an airship after a bit and start interrogating and stealing my townsfolk. I'd like to know where that goes. And it's a pre-demo press preview build, right? I'm sure the developer sent it out because they know it isn't quite where they need it to be and wanted to see how the press reacted, so here's my reaction: sort out the first hour. Make me obsessed with your world rather than just a bit irritated at what parts you've seemingly randomly chosen to obscure from me, and give me an interesting goal straight away rather than just telling me to build things with no real sense of what I'm working towards. Otherwise: Nice elvish buildings. Nice concept. And, yes, very nice tree (hey!)</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkswitch-is-frostpunk-in-a-big-tree-with-music-from-silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I do not want to control five zombies and three skeletons <em>and</em> my party and also maybe a dog, is usually what stops me rolling necromancers in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. Zombies: quite slow, famously, but in CRPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-necromancers-tale">The Necromancer's Tale</a> the undead <em>are</em> your party. Seems no-one wants to travel with a guy whose shoes smell like embalming fluid these days. Fine. I'll make my own mates. Out of bodies.</p>

<p>The twist here is that you'll be trying to keep your midnight proclivities a secret from the townfolk, brushing the proverbial Chocolate Hobnob crumbs of forbidden arcane arts out of your beard and burning the packet before everyone else wakes up. There's a sort of social stealth system, too, that sees you chocolate hobnobbing at high society parties, presumably trying to not open every conversation with "Hi I'm Terry and all my mates are animated cadavers". There's also an excellent fully illustrated spellbook.</p>
<p>CRPGs come in a few flavours usually. You've got your swordies and wordies and the occasional nicely balanced swordy-wordy. NecTales has hex-based combat where you cast spells, backed up by your gang of flaky shamblers and clattering calcium lads, but otherwise looks to be hanging about on the wordy side of the scale. "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore," to be precise, alongside hand-drawn portraits for 180+ NPCs. "We have not used any generative AI in the game", say developers Psychic Software. Good by me. If I wanted to engage with a pallid, grotesque simulacrum of something real, I'd raise another zombie.</p>
<p>The game is set near alternate history Venice on the cusp of the Enlightenment - a setting apparently rife for exacerbated tensions between science and superstition. This history is not so alternative, however, as to prevent Twickenhamese satirist Alexander Pope popping up in the corner, presumably to bang on about Homer to anyone in earshot.</p>
<p>The Necromancer's Tale is out next month, July 17th. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">demo on Steam</a> available now. Cheers to <a href="https://youtu.be/lnfuHU9rSlw">Turn Based Lovers</a> for highlighting this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/befriend-zombies-18th-century-literary-satirists-in-rpg-the-necromancers-tale]]></content:encoded>
