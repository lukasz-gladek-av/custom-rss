            <p>A full-on remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2 was "technically on the road map" to follow the original Knights of the Old Republic remake which has been in development for the past few years. Well, that's at least the plan LucasFilm Games and co had as of March this year, with the KOTOR 2 remake's current status looking to be up in the air.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to court documents from earlier this year reported on by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">Game File</a> (paywalled) via <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">Kotaku</a>. The docs, which saw Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly mention the KOTOR 2 remake in some depositions, relate to a false advertising lawsuit filed against the licensor and Aspyr over failing to deliver on integrating fan-made mod <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (TSLRCM) into KOTOR 2's Nintendo Switch port, as previously promised. Said lawsuit's since been settled.</p>
<p>As part of talking about that, Reilly revealed these plans for a full KOTOR 2 remake, confirming that it was codenamed Project Juliet. "Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR 2 with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of KOTOR 2, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things," he said. "It was something we were discussing with Aspyr."</p>
<p>Reilly described this KOTOR 2 remake as being "technically on the roadmap" to come out after the remake of the first game, and confirmed the plan was for it to remake the cut content included in the TSLRCM mod. That was the state of play as of these depositions in March. As for that status of the KOTOR 2 remake right now, Game File's Stephen Totilo reports having had radio silence in response to reaching out about where it's currently at.</p><p>To be fair, it'd be weird for a KOTOR 2 remake to be an open book, given the messy and often worryingly silent development path the remake of the first Knights of the Old Republic has endured thus far. Announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced">back in 2021</a>, it's since reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-doesnt-look-good-for-the-kotor-remake-again-as-reports-claim-its-not-being-worked-on-by-any-studio">feared to be cancelled</a>, then was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-at-least-two-people-are-reportedly-still-working-on-that-kotor-remake">worked on by at least two people</a>. Saber Interactive being sold off by Embracer Group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-release-left-in-limbo-by-saber-interactive-sale">cast fresh doubt</a> over the game, and the most recent update was Saber's CEO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-devs-insist-the-game-is-alive-and-well-after-their-split-from-embracer">declaring it "alive and well"</a> last April.</p>
<p>The court docs reveal's a good start, KOTOR 2 remake, but you've got a long way to go to catch up. Assuming you've not quietly gone the way of the dodo since March.</p>

            <p>
I am sure the words "new" and "Ace Attorney game" have functioned as a sleeper agent's activation words for some of you, and these are words that Capcom themselves have sort of put together, but let's slow down before we get carried away. As spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man">Mega Man</a> fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html?m=1">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom have released their <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf">integrated report for 2025</a>, which for the most part is boring, corporate nonsense. Here comes the but. But! It also appears to suggest that the developer is thinking about new ways it can further develop series like Ace Attorney, as well as Mega Man and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Apologies for the business speak here, but this is what Capcom had to say: "Capcom owns a wealth of globally popular brands, such as Mega Man, Devil May Cry, and Ace Attorney. We aim to expand our user base and improve our performance through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware. By enhancing brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases, we will grow these into core IPs." Just one second, need to wash off the stench of buzz words real quick.
</p>
<p>
Right, back! Now, that obviously doesn't 100% confirm a new game for the likes of any of the mentioned titles. However, at this point, as far as I'm aware, there's literally only the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney crossover game that's left to be ported, so perhaps there's hope for both this and something new too, you rabid Phoenix x Miles shippers.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Mega Man, there hasn't been a new mainline game since 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, leaving ample room for a reawakening. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> came out in 2019, too, so it's not surprising Capcom is looking to breathe some life back into that one, even if it got a new mobile game last year. The developer has done quite well for itself with Resident Evil, Monster Hunter (well, not so much you, Wilds), and Street Fighter in recent years, so it isn't exactly a surprise that they're interested in a bigger slice of pie. Now all we need is a Dark Void reboot, the series everybody desperately wants a comeback for. Right? Right?
