            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> just got a fresh patch, and it's come with a free cape (not a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">review bomb cape</a>, mind you) that folks who took part in the battle for Super Earth can wear to prove they played a part in the victory. Stick it on your back, and maybe think about showing it off in the glitzy glow of the spotlights the patch adds to Leviathans.</p>
<p>Seriously, I promise doing that last bit won't precede the flying squid things immediately zapping you to death. Ok, maybe it will.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a look through the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/580514905803724132?l=english">Patch 01.003.103</a>, Arrowhead have outlined that the Battle for Super Earth commemorative cape will be dished out to everyone who's logged into the game at some point in the past 60 days and played between May 13th and June 2nd. It's dubbed "Protector of the Heart", and looks pretty swanky provided you're into rocking a big white outline of a planet, accompanied by some gold flourishes.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, the most noteworthy tweak looks to be the addition of spotlights to Leviathans alongside a reduction of their sight range, in order to give players a bit more notice they they're in the firing line. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldiomm/new_leviathan_spotlights/">this Reddit post</a> demonstrates, those who don't heed the signal to dive out of the way get to stand bathed in light for a few seconds before being death rayed into the great Fascist afterlife.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED</p><p>A cape has been issued commemorating the defense of Super Earth from hostile, evil, and threateningly unknowable alien forces. This cape represents the boundless gratitude of all citizens for the Helldivers' selfless and innumerable sacrifices. <a href="https://t.co/CVMPPKIXdz">pic.twitter.com/CVMPPKIXdz</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1934940086593810566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Why not take advantage and whip out an inspirational emote so the moment of your death is immortalised in the rest of your squad's minds forever? Sure, John got instakilled by a sneaky squid snipe, they'll recall to their grandkids, but he died miming the tipping of an imaginary cowboy hat.</p>
<p>The other enemy tweak is an increase to the health of Mega Shrieker nests in order to make sure you've got to be more resourceful to crush the bugs. The patch also delivers a bunch of bug fixes and tweaks, including a bunch to the Warrant pistol from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">Force of Law warbond</a> and some that ensure the Borderline Justice warbond armours match their stats.</p>
<p>Arrowhead's even made sure planting the Super Earth flag via the One True Flag stratagem "would cause objective items to clip through the ground".</p>
<p>The game's latest major order, a fight against some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">urban Terminid invasions</a>, is set to end today. So, we'll have to see where the caped-up defenders of Super Earth are sent next.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft made a brief statement today to reassure antsy fans of time travel that their remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time</a> is still in development. "Yep, we’re still deep in the game," they said in <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">a social media post</a>, "exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose."  Okay. We weren't asking, but okay.</p>

<p>"This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares," the post continued, "and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us."</p>

<p>The remake of the 2003 action adventure game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-announced">announced back in 2020</a>. But it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-is-delayed-again">delayed</a>. Then it got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-to-2022">delayed</a>. After that, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-development-jumps-to-ubisoft-montreal">delayed</a>. And then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-isnt-cancelled-but-pre-orders-have-been-refunded">everyone who pre-ordered it got a refund</a>. Weeeeee, what an adventure! </p>
<p>News of the game's ongoing development appears to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-in-the-early-stage-of-development">resurface on a yearly basis</a>, and last we heard it was scheduled for release some time in 2026, although we have still not seen any recent footage of the game outside of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">simple teaser trailer last year</a> (the trailer above shows work that Ubisoft say has since been reworked from scratch). </p>
<p>This latest update (if "we're still alive" can be counted as an update) is only news in the sense that the game's development hell has been interesting to follow, if mildly painful for fans of the original time travelling platformer. Ubisoft's short post is also possibly the result of a social media manager's mistake, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/prince-of-persia-social-media-botch-forces-ubisoft-to-promise-once-again-that-its-still-working-on-the-sands-of-time/">PC Gamer</a>. It seems that somebody accidentally posted a cryptically worded tweet to the Prince Of Persia account instead of the intended <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> account, and it sent Prince fans (not those ones) into a frenzy of speculation that needed to be addressed by actually saying something real. </p>
<p>The original Prince Of Persia was a simple but likeable tale which popularised the undo-like "rewind" button of puzzle platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/braid">Braid</a>. The combat sections were repetitive and overlong, but that doesn't stop it from being one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/9-of-the-best-games-with-time-travel">the best games with time travel</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
