            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skullduggerous space MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> has changed the way its glittering golden subscription token is sold in the hellish hypercapitalist void. The change affects Plex, a shiny type of trade good you can use to re-up your subscription to the game. From now on, the ethereal digigood will be sold on a magical "global" market across the entirety of space, as opposed to being sold locally from region to region. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not an absolutely game-changing economic shake-up, but it may mildly irritate any folks who speculate on Plex as if it were shares in (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">ew</a>) Microsoft. The change might also make interesting reading for anyone who likes to think about Eve as a petri dish for Earth's increasingly corposwamped global economy.</p>
<p>Like the laser turrets and afterburners of Eve's interstellar market, you can sell and buy Plex for big amounts of in-game money. And just like any product, it has sometimes been more expensive to buy on one side of the galaxy, but cheaper on the other side. If you theoretically gathered a few billion ISK (the standard space credit earned by whacking rats or selling dodgy antennae) you could buy a stack of this Plex stuff and pay for your next month's subscription in real life. Neat. But it might be cheaper to buy in safe territory and more expensive deep in the wilderness. </p>
<p>This change means you'll now simply buy Plex via a global pool of sellers, which will appear the same anywhere in  New Eden, according to developers CCP.

</p><p>"This friction-free system aims to boost liquidity, enable a fair market equilibrium, and support EVE's evolving economy," they say in <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/global-plex-market-and-friction-free-trade">a post explaining the new market</a> (they also offer the <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/patch-notes-version-23-01">full patch notes</a>).

<p>"As stewards of New Eden's economy, CCP acts as both custodian and regulator, a central bank of sorts," the post continues. "PLEX plays a foundational role in this system. But over time [...] its function has drifted. It's increasingly treated as a long-term investment or speculative asset, rather than a flexible, fluid currency meant to empower player choice. That dynamic distorts pricing, limits access, and creates artificial scarcity that benefits a few at the expense of many. 

</p><p>"Weâ€™re committed to fixing that, without resorting to harsh measures like inventory taxes, price hikes, or product removals. Instead, we're focused on system-level changes that move us closer to a healthy, fair market equilibrium."

</p><p>For those of us not fluent in brokerspeak, CCP may basically be seeking to flatten out the price of their valuable little pretend gold bar across the entirety of pretend space. Plex is special, according to the devs, since it is also sold for real money directly by CCP. This makes it "the only item in the game directly tied to real-world currencies". </p>
<p>But it also acts like gold does in real world trade markets - a safe place for dirtbags to store their wealth. So it makes sense that CCP would want such a good to remain roughly the same everywhere. Stable. Goldish. In the short term, it may make Plex cheaper, as players selling it now have to compete against every other seller in the galaxy - not just their local star regions. In the long-term, everything may simply level out. </p>
<p>None of this, as far as I can tell, is related to the developers' ongoing attempts to drive players towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a>, a spin-off game that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">full of blockchain bullshit</a> and harbouring a cryptocurrency called the "Eve Token". CCP are incresingly shy of mentioning these facts in their marketing and advertising, but you can read about it by scrolling down <a href="https://evefrontier.com/en/faq">their FAQ</a>. My advice: avoid.</p>

            <p>If you dream of playing a game set inside a diagram of a spacebase from a Usborne Cutaway book published in the 1990s, Kuu is probably for you. If you dream of being very sad on the Moon, tending sickly plants for 30 days by Earthlight, then Kuu is also, probably, for you. If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> but wish it was as depressing as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, Kuu is also also, probably, for you.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's a bright and bony colony management game in which you play the titular Kuu, a "silent caretaker" for a "fragile sisterhood", trapped in a lunar greenhouse that has been trashed by a "mysterious blast" from a "long-abandoned Earth". You will divide each day between such tasks as setting up the solar panels (at the cost of blocking the light to your growpods), scouring the radio spectrum for help, and combing downloaded documents for answers about your plight. Here be trailer.</p>

<p>Being a silent caretaker, you will only be able to nod or shake your head when your sisters come to you with questions or requests. "Some will starve, and some will snap," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3442050/KUU/">the Steam page comments</a>. "It will be your fault." Good-O. Each night, you'll retire to a hibernation pod and pick through a monograph left behind by a "disgraced pseudo-archaeologist". If it were me, I'd be binging Toradora excerpts and tearfully devouring a very large bowl of cereal, but I imagine Kuu doesn't have access to Youtube.</p>
<p>Kuu is the work of the perhaps humourously named Interactive Tragedy, Limited, founded by <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/zach.dodson">New Zealand academic Zach Dodson</a>. It's the video game component of a hybrid book project which seeks to "combine traditional print design and creative writing with new approaches in interactive fiction and visual narrative".</p>
<p>While I find some of the Steam page language a little too pointed in its poignancy, I like the cut(away) of Kuu's gib. I also like the sound of Dodson's research in general, as briefly outlined in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3442050/view/528724050310070595?l=english">this Steam post</a> on how "the affordances of different media can create a narrative ecosystem", which reminds me a bit of Whitney Trettien's <a href="https://whitneyannetrettien.com/thesis/">work on volvelles</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones]]></content:encoded>
