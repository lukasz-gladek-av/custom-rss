            <p>
Coffee Stain remain dissatisfied with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, their first-person factory sim, despite Matt Cox giving it the Cox's Orange Pippin Award in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-10-review">Satisfactory 1.0 review</a>. They're just about to release update 1.1 into public testing. This adds Photo Mode, programmable personnel elevators, and a bunch of twisty furnishings. 
</p>
<p>
One thing it doesn't add is rain, which used to exist in Satisfactory but was removed because it wasn't working properly. Apparently, Coffee Stain need to do an Unreal Engine upgrade before they can restore the missing precipitation. Many players are sad about this. Ah, I think it's kind of poetic that there are people in the Satisfactory community who wish only to be rained upon.

<p>
Here's a video in which the developers break down update 1.1's additions.

<p>
And here's a quick summary of the highlights. They're adding branches for hypertube networks, allowing you to shoot down one or the other branch as though switching rails in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a>. They've got some fancy new throughput counters for conveyor belts so that you can easily track how many items a line is carrying. The editor now supports curved building modes for belts, and straight building mode for pipes. There are also new vertical belt splitters and mergers for people who like to expand upwardly, perhaps because they've covered every inch of available soil in metal.
</p>
<p>
New bits and pieces include railway buffers to close out railroads, and the aforesaid personnel elevators - more of a cosmetic flourish in a game with jetpacks, perhaps, but you can customise what the buttons do, and I imagine Satisfactory players will find many arcane applications for such functionality. Just don't use them to transport vehicles, because the game will act as though you've chucked a bunch of forklifts onto a bouncy castle.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least - proper controller support for your Eggbox and PlayStaycation peripherals! There's no final public release timing for the update yet beyond its experimental branch rollout from tomorrow, 1st April. That choice of release date is obviously cause for suspicion, but the developers assure us in the video that, unlike the Cox's Orange Pippin Award, update 1.1 is a real thing that exists.

            <p>"Alien Ant Farm or we boycott," reads the top comment on Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1905290954191298620">recent reveal</a> of the next wave of tracks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> - a response to the revelation that the upcoming remasters have both been hit <em>and</em> struck by some soundtrack changes, which hasn't gone down completely smoothly with fans. You could almost say they feel making alterations to such classics is criminal. OK, I'll stop. For now.</p>
<p>It turns out these changes come straight from the large Hawk himself. “It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST,” he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-explains-controversial-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-changes-it-was-my-choice/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride. More to come… both old and new.”</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely buy this, for no substantial reason other than I've grown too weary to accept such chummy reasoning for anything a publisher the size of Activision does ever. Still, I reckon you've got a point there, Mr. Tony 'Tony Hawk' Hawk. The original games's role in introducing US skate punk and hip hop to a huge audience outside the states was undeniable, as was its influence on baggy jean and wallet chain sales. Giving exposure to some lesser known bands is no bad thing, even if I'm personally devastated by the<a href="https://youtu.be/yFA7c7uK5Ks"> loss (or lack of mention so far) of AFI</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hDolkBP98Mg">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose this might have gone down better if it wasn't for the already announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-career-mode-timer-1851768305">changes to THPS's career mode</a> (Kotaku), which is getting replaced by time challenges ala the prior games, though there'll reportedly still be a free skate option. </p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/">out on Steam</a> July 11th, 2025. I assume so much licensed music means they'll be a robust option for streamers. Otherwise they might get copyright-struck down. Possibly in the bedroom. It'll be their doom, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list. Now, Square Enix have added a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">dedicated 25th anniversary</a> page flogging figures, spectacles, and other charming tat to their website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s 25th cake day isn't until July 7th, but this new page <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097">lines up with claims</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a> leaker NateTheHate that we're getting closer to an announcement, if not a release. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-reportedly-real-and-happening-giving-hope-for-one-of-the-series-finest-to-finally-come-to-pc">has also claimed</a> that the Final Final Tactics remaster is still being worked on - a rumour that's been twinned with the FF9 one for about as long as it's been floating about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
