            <p>I dunno about you, but I usually dig a big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">mod</a> that threatens to make my number of hours spent padding around Tamriel even more ludicrous. Lordbound is the latest danger to the free time of poor folks like me, having just soft launched after ten years of development spent creating a fresh region bigger than the Dragonborn DLC's Solstheim and filling it with stuff to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160493">The mod</a>'s set in the Druadach Valley between Skyrim and Daggerfall's setting of High Rock, and so offers a chance to mix it up with tribal orcs, Imperial legionnaires, and highfalutin Breton lords. Think The Reach, but with a few less plant-hearted warriors and weird bird-ladies. Those three factions form the pillars of "the biggest main quest you've ever played in Skyrim, with choices and consequences that change the state of the valley". Here's a synopsis of the situation you'll walk into:</p>
<blockquote><p>The drums of war are beating inside the Druadach Valley. After two hundred years of isolation the valley has restored its severed connections to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock, exposing its withered remains to the rest of Tamriel. Chief Gorek of Garshakur refuses to surrender his mountain fortress to the Imperial Legion, denying them control of the highly-valued trade route between the cities of Jehanna and Solitude.</p>
<p>As the war wages on, the people of Druadach are forced to seek protection within the walls of Highreach, home of the young Lord Haelan - but even the last bastion of Druadach is threatening to fall at the hands of a mysterious knight of unknown origin, leaving only death in its wake. Whatever the choices are in the end, the fate of the valley rests in the hands of champions both new and old.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice Elder Scrolls lore knot to unpick by shouting at things and also slapping things with your sword. The modders reckon that, plus the 40 or so new quests and 50 or so new dungeons that help flesh out the valley, will keep you occupied for around 60 hours. Damn, that's about 1/8th of the time it usually takes me to sort my Skyrim load order out at any given moment.</p><p>That said, I'm slightly concerned that the mod cites "surprising consumables" alongside its fresh gear. What could be shocking to consume in the estimations of someone who's hung out with Sheogorath for at least five minutes during that one quest? Call dibs on which bodily fluid you reckon below. Anyway, the NPCs are fully voiced, so I'll be able to ask one of them to spill the beans.</p>
<p>Do expect some teething issues if you dive in at this soft launch stage to enquire for yourself. "We're still actively completing features of it, and there will be bugs," Lordbound's devs wrote. "While everything is largely playable, we still have work to do on the voice acting side of things. Additionally, our final checks have of course revealed more issues than anticipated. We scrambled to get the worst offenders fixed, but be fully prepared to encounter bugs through your adventures (not the chaurus kind)."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109">Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice</a> are requirements to get it running.</p>

            <p>
Oh boy. Unfortunately, it's one of those days. You might remember that last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom laid off an unspecified number of staff. Yep, that same Dune: Awakening that appeared to be doing pretty well for itself. Go figure! Today, there's more bad news, as it turns out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-hellsinger">Metal: Hellsinger</a> studio The Outsiders will be shutting down completely as part of said layoffs at parent company Funcom.
</p>
<p>
Founder of the studio David Goldfarb should word of the studio's shuttering in a statement posted to his own X account, explaining, "I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
"Many of us had survived a near-death studio experience years back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkborn">Darkborn</a> was cancelled and because of the team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellslinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen."
</p>
<p>
Goldfarb did try to offer a bit of hope amongst the gloom, as he did say the team is going to try and continue in "some new form." He also noted that if anyone reading the statement could offer help, from business leads, to helping employees find new work, anything would be appreciated. Fingers crossed that the team is able to find their footing.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, former editorial director Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-hellsinger-review">thought Metal: Hellsinger was bloody good</a>, so if you've already got it in your library but not tried it out yet, might as well give it a go.

<p>In an official reveal today, Ubisoft revealed that the DLC will arrive on November 18. Valley of Memory's new story chapter takes place just before the final story beats of the base game, with Basim looking for answers about his father. Both the base game and the DLC will see a bit of a parkour revamp, the ability to replay base game missions with fresh rewards, and three new difficulties - medium-plus, very hard and custom.</p><p>"When developing a game, we explore countless ideas and iterations for the setting in which the story takes place, the DLC's creative director, Oliver Leonardi, said. "For Mirage, we ultimately chose 9th century Baghdad as the backdrop. But, from the start, we had other locations in mind for Basim's journey." So, Ubisoft say, this DLC's about celebrating the game's second birthday by bringing one of those old ideas to life.</p>
<p>The reveal saw Ubisoft discuss how AlUla's been re-created in the game, with one of the talking heads being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-alsuhaibani-299443a6/?originalSubdomain=sa">Dr Abdulrahman A Alsuhaibani</a>, vice president of culture at the Royal Commission for AlUla. <a href="https://www.rcu.gov.sa/en">The Royal Commission for AlUla's website</a>'s 'our aspiration' section notes that their "development work in AlUla encompasses a broad range of initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts, reflecting the ambitious commitment to cultivating tourism and leisure in Saudi Arabia, outlined in Vision 2030." That'd be the <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi state's Vision 2030 project</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has declined to offer conclusive answers as to whether the free DLC has been funded by the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund. Since news of the DLC broke, the company has faced criticism and questions over working with the country, both externally and reportedly from staff. According to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A published by Game File's Stephen Totilo last month</a>, Ubisoft workers asked whether Ubisoft execs believed associating with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image earlier this year.</p>
<p>The worker specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a> in their question, which was allegedly carried out at the order of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi's murder aside, Saudi Arabia have an abysmal human rights record, including state-sanctioned homophobia and mass killings of migrants at the country's border with Yemen. The state has been accused of using investments in industries like games and sports to attempt to 'wash' this reputation, rendering itself more palatable in foreign eyes.</p><p>In that internal Q&amp;A, Ubisoft, who have asserted that they've retained creative control over the DLC, attempted to make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and bin Salman - who is also <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a>. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," the company's management said at the time.</p>

When Microsoft lit the rocket booster under Game Pass pricing last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-reveal-massive-game-pass-ultimate-and-pc-pass-price-hike-concede-that-price-hikes-are-never-fun">raising the cost of the Ultimate tier in the US by 50%</a>, they neglected to tell you that they'd also scrapped a 10% discount on DLC for Game Pass games, previously available to Ultimate subscribers. Now, when Ultimate subscribers buy DLC, they'll earn extra Microsoft Reward points, which can be traded for things like gift cards. Rather than saving you money, in other words, they're incentivising you to spend more of your cash inside Microsoft's business.
</p>
<p>
"This is not specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-it-scrapped-the-xbox-game-pass-discount-on-all-games-and-dlc-purchases-gives-subscribers-more-rewards-points-instead">Ian Games</a> in a statement. "Instead of a discount on the purchases, Ultimate and Premium subscribers will earn 10% and 5% - respectively - in points when purchasing select games and add-ons from the Game Pass library. Ultimate members continue to have 20% discount on select games from the Game Pass library. On top of that, all Rewards members will earn points when shopping games and add-ons on the Store, while Premium and Ultimate subscribers will earn even more, 2x and 4x respectively."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's Game Pass price hikes have attracted some spicy headlines, and a lot of wrathful posting on the socials. I'm sure they're as shocked by the negative reaction as you are. Meanwhile, former US Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan has observed (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-a-result-of-microsoft-becoming-too-big-to-care-says-former-ftc-chair">Eurogamer</a>) that these kinds of service "upgrades" are precisely why the FTC took the corporation to court over their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. 
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://x.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511">a Xitter post</a>, Khan remarked that the acquisition "has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. As we've seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences." The FTC made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition">much the same arguments</a> last year, when Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-and-xbox-game-pass-are-getting-a-worldwide-price-hike">a smaller price hike</a>.</p><p>Game Pass has made billions for Microsoft, but evidently, the bosses think it could be working harder for them, not least because it might be significantly cannibalising direct sales of Microsoft-published games. Given the timing, it’s possible the price hikes are designed to offset lost direct sales of Call of Duty games – Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/xbox-s-game-pass-hike-shows-cost-of-lost-call-of-duty-sales">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) quoted an unnamed former Microsoft employee as saying that putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 6 on Game Pass resulted in an internal estimated loss of $300 million in sales revenue across both console and PC. In their coverage of Bloomberg's story, <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-cost-microsoft-300-million-in-lost-sales-2000631659">Kotaku</a> calculate that Microsoft would need around 15 million players to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate for one month to make that up. Bloomberg also report that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has “asked Xbox to find other ways to increase profit” – they’re allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">testing an advertising-supported version of the Xbox game streaming service</a>.

</p><p>
Microsoft are making headlines for many reasons, right now - they're still the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">a boycott over their Israeli military connections</a>, and they're about to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">pull the plug on Windows 10</a>.
