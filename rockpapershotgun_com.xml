        <p>But it wasn't "lowkey or realistic" enough, according to former Bethesda character artist</p>

            <p>Ah <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, the game that left the collective consciousness long ago. In her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">review</a>, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a> (cheers <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/starfield-was-originally-going-to-be-much-gorier-former-bethesda-artist-reveals/">VGC</a> for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dennis Mejillones, who worked at Bethesda for almost 12 years - was asked why Starfield didn't end up as bloodthirsty as other games in the back catalogue, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. He explained that it had more to do with technical limitations than anything else, specifically "implications with the different suits" and how certain helmets might react to being cut and having the "meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is".</p>
<p>Eventually, Mejillones says, the systems "turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you had to account for". The game's character creator also "evolved quite a bit" during development, which played a big part in the difficulties.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mejillones goes on to contrast Starfield's style with that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, with Fallout full of "tongue-in-cheek humour" like the Bloody Mess perk where folks just "blow up into goo". Starfield "was meant to be more lowkey and realistic", he said.</p><p>"We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>, stuff like that, so I think it just didn’t fit thematically," Mejillones explained. "And on top of that you have the technical overhead cost to get it to work, so we were kind of like ‘it’s probably better not to include it in this game’."</p>
<p>Deep down I know that a gorier Starfield wouldn't have made up for the game being a drag, but man, it would've been a little less of a drag if I could've rended some space lad's head from his shoulders with a space shovel or something. At least the streaks of red would've added a splash of colour to the grey.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> devs. As hinted at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-director-forms-new-studio-with-cdpr-veterans-making-a-dark-fantasy-rpg">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dawnwalker-is-the-revolutionary-dark-fantasy-rpg-from-former-witcher-devs-rebel-wolves">times</a> over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.</p>

<p>"You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night", so says the trailer blurb. "Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."</p><p>Given that some of the air-quotes "gameplay" glimpsed at the end takes place in daylight, I’m interested to see how that fun-hating bastard The Sun affects your vampiric form. You obviously don’t crumble to ash at the slightest glimmer of UV light, but maybe your smoke-transmogrifying, magically head-exploding powers don’t work outside the night. Which would be a pretty big advantage loss, given that the vamps here have an enviable range of abilities, up to and including curing lethal illnesses by touch. I had a cold for literally all of December so hell, I’d be happy with just that one, let alone all the superhuman fighty stuff.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves have also said that The Blood of Dawnwalker is the first entry in a "saga", which is an ambitious framing for an infant studio, although if they’re dead set on making a spiritual successor to The Witcher then it probably would need to be a trilogy. No release date yet so it’ll be a while before we can see if this first game lays an appropriate foundation for said saga, though more in-game footage is promised for Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The "spance" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/annihilate-the-spance">Annihilate The Spance</a> is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 
</p>
<p>
It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/582330">Obliterate Everything</a> by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
As you’ve hopefully deduced, the rough flow here is that you clip modules for building, resource generation, and turret defence to the outside of your base core. It’s as though you’re growing a pearl from a chunk of asteroid dust. A pearl that proceeds to spawn huge armadas of spanceships. The ships range from zippy, brittle fighter craft through tougher, point-defence escorts to armoured cruisers and heavy beam artillery. You can give them waypoints by circle-painting an area of your base, then dragging out a line, but they’ll do all the warring themselves. You can also decide which shipyards produce what, and synchronise construction outputs to firm up your offensive.
</p><p>
It’s almost reminiscent of crowd control in Humanity, though the better comparison is of course another autobattler, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Nic will be spitting mad that I’ve played this before Mechabellum, after all his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">strenuous advocacy</a>. And in fairness to Battlemaster Reuben, Annihilate The Spance doesn’t seem as polished: the controls and presentation are on the functional side, with drag-selection a chore when your base hits a certain size. There’s also a surprising amount of plot involved, with some robustly written, ponderously scrolling mission briefings that may annoy those who just want to see two rolling hillocks of spanceships, sutured together by webs of laser fire.</p>
<p>Still, I had a blast playing the demo last night – there’s a nice rhythm of fussing over construction, then sitting back to watch your cloud of astral locusts softly consume another base. It seems targeted at older players who get back cramp if they have to micromanage too often. The kind of older player who can remember the golden age of Flash. Awww.
</p>
<p>
The game’s out in early access today, boasting 22 campaign missions, two playable factions, 50 or so warships and 20 base structures. The 1.0 release, slated for end of 2026, will add a third playable faction, the remaining story missions, and a level editor. There’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706360/Annihilate_The_Spance/">a demo on Steam</a> at the time of writing.
