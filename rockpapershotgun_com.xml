            <p>Every now and then we publish a round-up of game or demo recommendations, and all you regular readers dutifully fill the comments with recommendations of your own. FOOLS. Our round-ups are, of course, a devious trap for your curiosity and connoisseurship, designed to save us the labour of discovering good games for ourselves. You know in Batman Forever when Jim Carrey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAjgzwFHXd4">uses Riddler TV to steal everybody's IQs</a>? Well picture me doing that, except that I am not wearing tight green pyjamas (unless you want to picture me that way - no offence taken) and I am actually filling my skull with everything you ever knew about, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moadra">Moadra</a>'s case, manky Super Metroid clones.</p><!--more-->

<p>Batman Forever is the wrong analogy for this news piece. Let's get back on track. I learned about Moadra from a comment by Galactic Man on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">our latest Steam Fest demo round-up</a>, Developed by Gloomsoft, it casts you as a dinkier species of Predator, scouring inky catacombs of corpseflesh for a missing alien princess.</p>
<p>That's the plan, anyway, until you find the princess and she rips your gun-arm off. Fortunately, a fugitive boffin soon hooks you up with a new arm comprised of evolving primordial muck. Thanks to this timely injection of locally grown biomatter, you gain access to an upgrades tree with unlockable appendages such as Morrigan-style vampire wings. Then you set off afresh to find that pesky princess and, I imagine, rip <em>her</em> arms off. I think Moadra has the right attitude toward monarchy so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713730/Moadra/">The Steam demo</a> plays a lot like the more recent iterations of Metroid, with a fast, nimble protagonist who can crawl into chutes (no Samusball functionality, alas) and charge up projectiles that bounce from certain surfaces. The backdrop is straight out of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, however. Everything looks like the inside of a sickly lung. Such technology as may be found is busted and unclean.</p>
<p>A smaller point of differentiation: you shoot doors to open them, as in Metroid, but in Moadra - oh, I'm just picking up on the fact that "Moadra" sounds like "Metroid" through the Predator's voicebox! - you shoot them to activate short-ranged teleporters that flense you apart and put you back together in the next room. To ask the age-old question regarding teleporters, am I dying every time I use one, with my atoms and memories then forming a brand new being?</p>
<p>Honestly, if that's the worst thing that happens in Moadra I'll be thankful. There's a bossfight that basically traps you inside a cybernetic stomach with a brace of turrets and the head of a bellowing rat ogre. There's also some scanner functionality care of a flying drone pal that naturally harkens forward to Metroid's first 3D incarnation, Metroid Prime. Perhaps a cloaking device as well, Gloomsoft?</p>
<p>Will Moadra stand apart from Metroid in hindsight or will it prove to be just the same old metroidvania fittings coated in squirming filth, like a Samus figurine retrieved from the toilet? I'm not sure, but I look forward to finding out. There's no release date yet. Thanks again, Galactic Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">no longer exists even as a brand name</a>, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he <em>is</em> the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes in the form of a single tweet, following a grieving Monolith fan's request to "make the Condemned 1 &amp; 2 Remake &amp; quite f**king around". Hall <a href="https://x.com/JaceHall/status/1896149517063663708">responded</a>: "I will see what may be possible. Absolutely no promises. Please have ZERO expectations. This will take me some time."
</p>
<p>
Hall left Monolith in 2003 - two years before Criminal Origins launched on Xbox 360 - to work in an executive role at Warner. While at Warner, he co-led plans for a Condemned connected universe, spilling into the realm of film, but these ambitions never quite came to fruition. Hall departed Warner in 2008 to work at a string of outfits broadly concerned with game-as-service business models, entertainment production and esports. 
</p>
<p>
Even as he has moved between roles, however, Hall hasn't forgotten about Condemned. Back in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726144727/https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303">wrote on Facebook</a> that "I am consistently asked when a third game might be created" and that he is "contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/condemned-3-would-be-made-without-interference-or-limitations">Ian Games</a> subsequently, Hall reiterated that: "I am going to grant a license to use the Condemned franchise in general, and the chosen developer will be able to pick what kind of game they want to make. They can choose their vision of the content. They can build up momentum. Perhaps a prequel. Perhaps a simple mobile phone app for starters. It's all on the table. I'm open to hearing new ideas."
</p>
<p>
Would you like Condemned to return? I think Criminal Origins is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">a well-crafted horror game</a> with excellently vicious and antsy melee combat, but "well-crafted", here, risks being a justification for the fantasy of playing a cop who beats up homeless people and addicts with a pipe. That the cop's victims have been mutated and driven berserk by a sci-fantasy McGuffin doesn't really counter the argument that the game actively channels hatred towards the less fortunate, though Monolith are hardly the only horror game developers to do this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which game developer I'd trust to bring Condemned back. I guess the quickfix corrective optics would be to turn the tables and have you fight a bunch of deranged and screaming police.
