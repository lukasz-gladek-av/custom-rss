            <p>Yee haw. If you've ever thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> is a little low on folks in stetson hats whose spurs jingle, jangle, jingle, then this new quest mod will almost certainly be in your saloon. That's provided you're up for an unapologetically political story about NCR-backed Brahmin barons facing resistance from groups of local ranchers keen to avoid having their steads swallowed up by big business.</p>

<p>The mod's dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96464?tab=description">For A Few Brahmin More</a>' and is a project veteran New Vegas modder Ashtonlp101 has been working on for "around three years", presumably with Clint Eastwood westerns playing on repeat in the background. While they say it's "a small and focused story" in comparison to some of their other works - which to this point have included <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67052">Project Mojave</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66854">Saving Camp Searchlight</a>, this latest mod still looks pretty damn chunky. I mean, it has over 2,000 lines of fully-voiced dialogue according to the description.</p>
<p>"During the events of Fallout: New Vegas, an infamous Brahmin Baron named Buck Booth begins his operation in the Mojave, aiming to set up his eventual New Vegas empire," reads the setup for the mod's two main questlines. "However, the local ranchers and cowboys are showing resistance to the gentrification of their native land, and have formed a local Cowboy Coalition to end NCR corporate imperialism. The conflict has reached a turning point, with the Courier's intervention."</p><p>The action kicks off with you stumbling across flyers for the coalition in Goodsprings, Primm, or Novac. You can either head off to enlist with the group or heed the word of a Booth Baron agent who approaches you shortly afterward with a different proposal. Ashtonlp101 wrote that they've "put forth the best effort and foresight possible to ensure this story can be approached in any way the player desires", and to make sure it "may create some interesting moral dilemmas for NCR-oriented players" by not shying away from getting into nitty gritty of the faction's politics.</p>
<p>"Yes, the story is political," they added. "Yes, it is undoubtedly an allegory of US western expansion. Games are political, stories are political. That being said, I wrote this from a standpoint of finding some nuance between the two factions." That certainly sounds like the sort of deep storytelling and willingness to interrogate what makes the parties vying for wasteland control that played a big role in establishing vanilla New Vegas as my favourite modern Fallout.</p>
<p>Add in six side quests, a bunch of custom location interiors to serve as a backdrop, two new player homes you can end up with the keys to - plus new weapons and armour to collect - and you've got an extra adventure that sounds well worth giving a try.</p>
<p>If you fancy adding it to your load order next time you fire up New Vegas, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a> along with its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277">JIP LN</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927">JohnnyGuitar</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72541">ShowOff xNVSE</a> plugins.</p>

            <p>Nacon - publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - have announced that they've filed for insolvency. The French company say they've asked for "judicial reorganisation proceedings" to kick off, with the goal of finding ways to keep the business going, "protect employees, and preserve jobs" while renegotiating with creditors.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this has been announced by Nacon via <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">press release</a> today, February 25th. "On February 20th 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the publishers wrote.</p>
<p>As a result, Nacon said, "rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors" is necessary to try and keep the company going. So, in filing for insolvency, Nacaon's aim it to allow themselves time to "assess all possible solutions" to make sure they can carry on operating in a manner judged to be sustainable, "protect employees", and "preserve jobs". In the meantime, the publishers will be "renegotiating with...creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p>
<p>"This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan," Nacon summarised, adding that organisations representing its employees - that would include unions - were informed on February 24th that these decisions had been made.</p>
<p>A court's expected to rule on Nacon's request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings in early March, and in the interim the company's share price will remain suspended.</p>
<p>In recent years, Nacon have published the likes of goblin stealther Styx: Blades of Greed, robo copper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/robocop-rogue-city-review">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and critically panned racer Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. They spent a long time publishing Solar Crown devs KT Racing's pretty good WRC rally games, and recently <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">re-acquired the series' license from 2027 onwards</a> after EA decided Codemasters should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">just stop making their own very good rally games</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nacon announced <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/NACON-CONNECT-IS-BACK-ON-MARCH-4-2026">a showcase</a> set to take place on March 4th. That still looks set to go ahead and will feature updates on Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series - potentially alongside announcements of new games.</p>
<p>Solidarity to workers at Nacon during what I'm sure are stressful times.</p>
