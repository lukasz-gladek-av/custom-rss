            <p>
The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's "biggest updates" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In turn, the journal has been completely redesigned. The photos tab will now be the media tab, which organises evidence into photos, videos, and those aforementioned sound recordings. You'll need to fill your book up with unique media to achieve a perfect investigation, and there's some new events like EMF spikes, interactions like rocking chairs, and different ghost forms to help you do this.
</p>
<p>
The media quality system has been revamped too. Now whenever you capture your first bit of evidence of any media type, it'll be marked as unique, so you'll get some bonus dosh and experience once you've wrapped up a contract. Plus, there are some bug fixes coming with this update too.
</p>
<p>
Following the release of Chronicle, a rework of Grafton Farmhouse will be coming too. Kinetic explained in a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-19">blog post</a> that the whole map has been overhauled, namely some re-themed rooms, certain spaces increasing or decreasing in size, and there's a new "crowded attic, complete with sheet covered old furniture."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year Kinetic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobia-is-getting-a-new-haunted-location-but-wont-be-getting-any-more-big-maps">outlined the future of Phasmophobia</a>, promising more (but not big) maps, more map reworks, and Horror 2.0, the long awaited full release of the, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game.

            <p>
Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion Developments</a> revealed a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall's</a> first DLC expansion yesterday. Titled Wicked Isle, it unsurprisingly brings you to an island called Midsummer Island that is, in fact, a bit wicked, but like, in the bad way, not in the something a teen in the 2000s would say about something they like kind of way. Specifically it'll have a bit more of a folk horror vibe to it, which I'm certainly into conceptually. Lots of great folklore in the UK, as long as it's not stepping over frequently trodden upon territory.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion head of design Ben Fisher explains that the island is "close to the Windscale Atom Plant and as a result the levels of infection in both the people and environment are higher than on the mainland." It'll feature new enemies like pirate bandits and infected druids to fight, though you'll get some new weapons to fend them off in kind. That includes things like a blunderbuss shotgun, a cutlass, daggers, a new bow, and a beekeeper's staff. You know, the typical kind of things you find on a creepy island.

<p>
The completionists amongst you might also like to know (or dread to hear depending on how much you liked the game) that some of the new storylines can lead to new endings in the base game. No details on what those are, obviously, but I suppose the joy of experiencing things for the first time is just that!
</p>
<p>
There's a release date for the expansion too: June 3rd, just a few days away at the time of writing. Let's all see how it shapes up, as our own James found himself left wanting a bit with a lot of what Atomfall had to offer in his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-review">review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.

            <p>
Yesterday, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, the union made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers at Microsoft via its subsidiary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, reached a tentative contract agreement with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The union was formed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">back in 2022</a>, and has been bargaining with Microsoft in the intervening years since. Last month, the union was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to potentially strike against Microsoft</a>, but now it seems like this may be avoided.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If fully agreed to, the contract will bring in "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers", according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the CWA. On top of that, there would be protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a "crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." The press release notes that the agreement would also include an agreement made in 2023 in relation to how AI is used in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this contract isn't set in stone just yet. Explanation meetings need to be held for members over the coming weeks, and according to the CWA a ratification vote should be completed by June 20th. If it goes through, it will be a huge win for the workers, and should set a big precedent for game workers employed at a Microsoft-owned studio.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, a union made up of almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">was also formed alongside the CWA</a>, called the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild. Microsoft have already recognised this union as well. If things continue to go well for ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, perhaps we'll see wins at other unions further down the line. I for one have my fingers deeply tied for such results.
