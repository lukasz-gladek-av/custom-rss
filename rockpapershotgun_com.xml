<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</a>, is coming up to three years now, but at the Future Games Show this evening, all these years on, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> announced that the strategy action game will be getting its first bit of DLC, War Sails. If you can't gather from the name, featured image above, and trailer below, the DLC is all about boats; sailing 'em, fighting with 'em, trading with 'em, you name it, these boats can do it (within reason).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
War Sails quite notably is introducing a Viking-inspired faction, where you can do your usual thing of deciding to trade, recruit, or fight them (once you've made your way to the Northern Kingdom anyway). Based on details from a press release, sailing won't be as easy as 1, 2, 3 as you'll have wind and water physics to deal with.

<p>
But one thing that does sound neat, and you can catch a glimpse of in the trailer above, is that you'll be able to ram into and board enemy ships, as well as destroy their oars and tear their sails. Sounds like a slightly more in-depth take on what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has going on, and I'm quite fond of that game.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will have 18 ships to choose from, all of which handle differently and can be upgraded, and you'll be able to unlock more banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armour, that sort of thing. You've not long to wait either, as it's set to be released this coming June 17th.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, more free updates are planned too that'll bring in some new mechanics like a stealth and disguise system, a Parley feature, and general combat improvements. Best keep your eyes peeled for that one.

            <p>Frosthaven - the sequel to Cephalofair's knock-a-horse-out massive board game - is getting a digital version from Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games. You can <a href="http://playfrosthaven.com/">sign up here</a> to its closed beta kicking off March 27th, and it's coming to Steam early access later this year.</p>
<p>Like predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>, Frosthaven is a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you'll resolve story events and encounters between dungeon delving, retiring old characters and unlocking new classes as you progress. New to Frosthaven is a fleshed-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> that has you build up and  protect an outpost, while dealing with harsh seasons and invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I really <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">enjoyed Gloomhaven digital</a>, mostly for not getting in the tabletop game's way to much, but also for not requiring glue to put third party token trays together. Core to the game is tactical card combat where everything from movement to spellcasting is dictated by your hand. You pick two cards a turn from a deck you customise as you progress, and select actions from the top of one card and the bottom of the other. Each card also has an initiative value, so you're constantly assessing threats to see if you can pull off slower moves, or even whether you're better off sacrificing advanced plays altogether and opting for the generic attack or move option each card offers.</p>
<p>You can get old cards back by resting, but this means burning others. It's all crunchier than a Crunchy bar dredged in grit then left out to dry under an alien sun that emanates ultra-crunchy crunch rays, but  also full of character and a bit of roleplaying.</p>
<p>Designer Isaac Childres has consulted on the digital version throughout development, and Snapshot say they've spent a lot of time getting the feel of the world right in motion. In a preview session I attended recently, Director Hristo Petkov gave me the example of the Snowdancer. She's a bestial, graceful hero character whose dance-like fighting style the team had originally animated as similar to Capoeira - before Childres told them he'd imagined it closer to ballet. There's an entire environment named the Metallic Ruins in the digital version that only exists as prose in the board game, and they've worked closely with Childres to bring it to life here.</p>
<p>They're keen to highlight a more robust tutorial this time, too - also designed by Childres - alongside some more granular difficulty selections, including ones that prevent you getting exhausted and failing. The early access version has 35 quests across the first two acts of the game, with the full game planned to have over 130. There's also 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. I'm excited! I never ended up buying Frosthaven, since I'd also need to start sleeping on the box to justify the space investment, so this suits me just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
You know, with there being so many games set in ancient Rome, most of them being strategy games, I'm not sure I've ever seen a pixel art game with that setting. I bring this up because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a>, a pixel art game with that exact setting, just got announced at the Future Games Show. From the offset it looks a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>, and according to the publisher behind it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/three-friends">Three Friends</a> themselves, the latter is in fact a source of inspiration, alongside SNES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Described as a survival town-builder, Romestead lets you rebuild civilisation from ruin as a Roman leader (which as a concept considering publisher Three Friends is made up of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> devs). That involves things like putting your people to work by farming crops, smithing weapons, rounding up resources, all things you appear to be able to do yourself too, so I imagine you can't be tyrant right from the get go, as was typical of many Romans back in the day.
</p>
<p>
There's a worship system where you can pray to a bunch of Roman gods to unlock various buildings, upgrades, technologies, all of which I find amusing very conceptually. "You have prayed enough to me so I give you the gift of a slightly bigger house" is how I imagine to play out, which tickles me in a "aren't video games so quaint?" kind of way.
</p>
<p>
That Zelda element comes in through dungeons that you can explore and bosses you can face off against, and a big ole world to explore too. And to boot you don't have to do it alone as there's multiplayer co-op too.
</p>
<p>
Romestead doesn't currently have a release date, but it is planned for an early access release. If this all takes your fancy, then you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805320">here</a>.
