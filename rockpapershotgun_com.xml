            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> turned fifteen this month, <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update">prompting a blog from 4A Games</a> celebrating the FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series' past while looking forward to the next entry. The unnamed Metro 4 surfaced again last January as part of a reveal for VR title <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a>, following a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/studio-update-exodus-sdk">2023 blog</a> detailing the studio's experience under the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>"We do want to reassure you that work is continuing on both of our projects despite missile strikes, air-raid sirens, and terror still raining down on Ukraine," reads the new blog. "These circumstances are incredibly challenging, the situation remains dangerous and not within our control, but we are currently as safe as possible, and we want to manage your expectations around the reveal of the next Metro title, it will be ready when it is ready, and we can’t wait for you to see it".</p>

<p>The 2022 invasion of Ukraine "changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game," 4A continue. "As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make."</p>
<p>The series - set in Moscow's metro tunnels and following the survivors of global nuclear  war - began life as a novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky, first published online when the author was just eighteen, then in print in 2005. Glukhovsky, originally from Moscow, is currently abroad after a court ordered his arrest in absentia following <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/07/russia-court-orders-arrest-of-critical-sci-fi-writer-a77926">public criticism of Russia's invasion</a>.</p>
<p>"Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war and often emotional story," write 4A Games. "You can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To avoid harassment, staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> studio Ubisoft Quebec have been "advised" not to celebrate or otherwise post on social media about the game's launch this week, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html">BFM TV</a> and spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">Kotaku</a>.</p>
<p>This follows months of online anger directed at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, much of it from charming sods with handles like 'Da Phrenology Gamer' doing everything they can to avoid actually playing videogames, presumably before logging off for dinner and complaining that they don't want to eat any more woke broccoli, mum. Can't-hang-viceroy Elon Musk even got involved at one point, commenting "DEI kills art" on a tweet about the game (as opposed to, you know, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/doge-education-department-cuts-trump">cutting education funding</a>).</p>

<p>While much of this ire was targeted at the inclusion of black samurai protagonist Yasuke, it's worth noting that Ubisoft themselves <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116">released a statement last July</a> apologising for promotional materials "that have caused concern within the Japanese community", while emphasising that Shadows aims to be an "immersive and respectful" work of historical fiction rather than "factual representation".</p>
<p>They don't specify which materials, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-statement-yasuke-1851602337">Kotaku note that Ubisoft apologised separately</a> for the use of a flag belonging to military reenactment group Sekigahara Teppo-tai. Collectibles company <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/figurine">PureArts also pulled a figurine</a> depicting the game's protagonists in front of a one-legged torii gate, which some felt disrepectfully evoked the damage caused to Nagasaki's Sannō Shrine in the 1945 bombing.</p>
<p>This has all contributed towards an online atmosphere of hostility towards the game, which BFM TV report has culminated in an internal anti-online harassment plan at Ubisoft. "It's an initiative from Canada. There's a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack," an employee told the outlet, via Google Translate. "Unlike what we've had before, this is serious".</p>
<p>Activity on X, Reddit, and Youtube will be "closely monitored by a dedicated unit", write BFM TV, "in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem". Lawyers are prepared to "file complaints in the event of proven harassment."</p>
<p>“Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own," a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan">Ubisoft spokesperson told PCGN</a>. "Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.”</p>
<p>Ubisoft aren't the only publisher to take similar steps in recent months. In January, Square Enix announced a new policy vowing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">clamp down on harassment, bigotry and, uh, fallacious compensation requests</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
