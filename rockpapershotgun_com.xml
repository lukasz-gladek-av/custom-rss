            <p>The team behind Electronic Arts-published early access skateboarding game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-2025">Skate</a> have announced that they're laying off an unspecified number of staff. Well, I say that, Full Circle have actually announced that they're "transforming as a studio", which happens to entail "making changes to our team structure" which impact some folks' jobs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re reshaping Full Circle to better support Skate’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you - and making those things great," is another way they put it in a short <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">blog post</a>. As for the affected devs, the studio noted that they're "talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of Skate", adding that "this decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition."</p>
<p>As for Skate, which only arrived in early access as of September last year, the plan is for the remaining staff to keep on grinding, while being able to "move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently". How having less hands on deck is supposed to make any of that easier, I don't know.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3354750/view/502850552192829278">most recent update</a> on plans for the game, put out late last week, Full Circle announced that they'll be changing how they present info about when new additions are coming - making clear which ones are actively in development and which are just being loosely explored/discussed with no set timeline for arrival.</p><p>"We’re doing this to be clear about where things stand - and about how we work," the studio wrote. "The further out something is on the roadmap, the more room it has to shift, or sometimes, be shelved altogether. But we’d rather show you what we’re thinking, even while it’s shifting, than wait until everything is locked. That’s how we want to approach Early Access with you. For example, Open World Collection was on the last roadmap. We’ve taken it off for now so we can focus on more social features – specifically Meetups and Turn-Based Competitive Modes – which we know are high on your wishlist."</p>
<p>Solidarity to those affected by these layoffs at Full Circle. If you're looking for an interesting read about Skate, J.C. Rodriguez's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sanitisation-of-skate-reminds-me-how-far-counterculture-has-fallen-and-how-hard-it-can-be-to-stay-inspired">feature from November</a> about the game and where it sits in the wider landscape of skateboarding culture is well worth a look.</p>

            <p>Valve's Lionel Hutzes have been summoned to slide down the fireman's pole and deal with yet more legal wranglings involving the behemoth behind Steam. New York state attorney general Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating gambling laws via the use of loot boxes in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people," attorney general James writes in a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">press release</a> announcing the suit's filing. "Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."</p>
<p>Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> are named directly in the release as games which, in the office of the attorney general's estimation following an investigation, "enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value".</p>
<p>"In Valve’s most popular game, the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item," the release continues. "The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million."</p><p>Counter-Strike gun and knife skins selling for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-casually-gut-counter-strikes-billion-dollar-skins-market-with-a-small-update">bananas real money sums</a> via third-party marketplaces is specifically mentioned further on, with the attorney general's office asserting the Valve "facilitates and even assists these third-party marketplaces in their operations". In addition to emphasising that she sees Valve's loot boxes of being "especially harmful to children", James also dips into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/academic-studies-of-violence-cause-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-arent-we-discussing-videogame-violence">very</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/president-trump-showed-a-weird-frag-montage-in-his-video-game-violence-meeting">very</a> long-running talking point that is whether games with violent gunning in them are a factor in causing real life violent gunning.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that Valve’s promotion of games that glorify violence and guns helps fuel the dangerous epidemic of gun violence, particularly among young gamers who can become numbed to grave violence before their brains are fully developed," the attorney general alleges.</p>
<p>Overall, James' lawsuit seeks to "permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve for comment.</p>
<p>The lawyers of the company behind Steam certainly haven't been allowed to sit around and twiddle their thumbs in recent years. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-will-face-that-656m-uk-lawsuit-accusing-them-of-overcharging-steam-customers-as-tribunal-rules-it-can-go-ahead">last month</a>, a tribunal ruled that a £656 million UK lawsuit accusing them of using Steam's dominance over the PC market to act "anti-competitively", resulting in customers being overcharged, will go ahead to the next stages of the legal process.</p>
