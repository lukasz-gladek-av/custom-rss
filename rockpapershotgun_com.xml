            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> probably won't get a second major DLC expansion on the scale of Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft's associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed. It's a blow to fans who are accustomed to getting a couple of major expansions per Assassin's Creed, and a boon to people who haven't even played Shadows yet, let alone the 10-hour-long Claws of Awaji, and are getting dry heaves from FOMO. It's me, I am people.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently," Lemay-Comtois revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">JorRaptor</a>, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">Ian Games</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years." The developers are trying "to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it."
</p>
<p>Claws Of Awaji aside, the first year of Shadows updating brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-a-self-driving-horse-but-i-implore-you-not-to-use-it">self-driving horses</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-much-needed-parkour-update">posher parkour</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-adds-in-collabs-with-dead-by-daylight-and-balatro-of-all-things">Balatro collaborations</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-brings-in-a-nightmare-difficulty-mode-and-another-weird-collab">nightmare difficulty</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient">a more conveniently made open world</a>, amongst other tweaks to the furnishings. The second year "will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed, but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more," Lemay-Comtois suggested in the interview.
</p>
<p>"I'm not announcing anything at this point," he went on, "but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it." 
</p><p>As IGN note, 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> both had two expansions, while 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla got three, with 2023's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> starting out as yet another Valhalla expansion. Why is Shadows getting stiffed with a measly single expansion? Because it was uncommonly hard to develop, Lemay-Comtois explained, with a major technological overhaul that contributed (along with the "soft" performance of stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>) to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a delayed release</a>.
</p>
<p>"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he said. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. The planning for the post launch was not really as clear as it would have been on [previous AC games] where the technology is more stable and well known."
</p>
<p>Shadows originally had a proper season pass, but Ubisoft canned it alongside the delay announcement, and decided to give away Claws of Awaji for free. "I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," Lemay-Comtois added. "And that situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production."
</p>
<p>It seems possible the decision to stop at one Shadows expansion also reflects wider turmoil at Ubisoft, who are busily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Anyway, the upshot is that you AC diehards now have around 10 hours of playtime back to fritter away on something else. I recommend the similarly shadowy and backstabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a>. Alternatively, you could spend it playing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake that absolutely isn't coming in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.
