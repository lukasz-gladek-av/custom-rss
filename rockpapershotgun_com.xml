            <p>If I went to hell, I can't imagine the first thing on my mind would be trying to pull off a bank job with a crew of fellow damned souls. However, in freshly announced tactical RPG Thousand Hells: The Underworld Heists, that's the sort thing you'll be doing, with plenty of choice and consequence if things go pear-shaped.</p>
<p>Thousand Hells is the latest cool thing from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/six-ages">Six Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King of Dragon Pass</a> devs A Sharp. While they're working with Kitfox Games as publisher again, there's plenty of different stuff going on, including a move away from world of Glorantha as a setting. That's in favour of fantasy pastures new, inspired by myths of the ancient proto-Indo-European, Norse, and Mesopotamian varieties. Oh, and a dash of Hieronymus Bosch's lovely paintings.

<p>"I’d like to push procedural storytelling in a new direction, both in how the quests are generated and with the narrative game that lets you use your team’s traits to resolve situations by making story choices, not just dice rolls," A Sharp founder David Dunham said of the game. "And it’s fun to see the system that Robin Laws and I designed put to use by other writers."</p>
<p>Thousand Hells revolves around four heroes making the toasty jaunt to hell, each of these folks being "procedurally generated with fears, desires and personalities". Once there, your job is to pull together a team with different skills and a set of temperaments that won't result in blowups midway through the "trials of the underworlds" you'll be trying to overcome. There's a "mysterious ambassador" you're contracted to do it all for, which doesn't sound ominous whatsoever.</p>

<p>The stakes, if it wasn't clear, are high. "Use the strengths of your party in over 200 unique dynamic narrative encounters," reads the game's blurb. "Skills will change depending on your team’s successes and failures. Avoid combat by sending your bard to calm the nerves of bandits. Hire a demonologist to communicate with a possessed book. Take the risk and reap the rewards, otherwise you’ll end up with a broken arm, or worse."</p>
<p>Sounds like a game that might be my cup of tea, provided I can still hold said cup of tea after I've had these things my hands are attached to violently wrenched out of place and put in casts. In all seriousness, any game that has four different types of mastermind and art as surreally majestic as this is well worth a look.</p>

        <p>Maybe Strauss Zelnick's been asked about the GTA 6 price one too many times</p>

            <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has reaffirmed 2K Games' assertion that the reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> 4, currently in the works at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a>, will make it to release.</p>
<p>The reassurance follows a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one">report from Bloomberg earlier this week</a> which reported that the game had failed a recent internal progress check, with the story specifically being tapped as an aspect that needs reworking, and some of the devs working on it have been reassigned to non-BioShock roles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hence why, in an interview around 2K Games' parent company Take-Two's latest financial report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">IGN</a> asked Zelnick whether BioShock 4 is in danger of being canned. "It’s going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," the exec responded. "We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership."</p>
<p>Zelnick went on to cite living up to the "legacy" left by series creator and current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> developer Ken Levine, as well as the reputations carved out by its previous entries, as a tough task. "We need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand," he explained.</p>
<p>This was was also, unfortunately, where words began to word. As part of his explanation of why BioShock 4 is taking a while to come out, Zelnick offered the following as the reason game development cycles are getting longer:</p>
<blockquote>I think it's a reflection of the fact that as entertainment businesses mature, consumers seek quality and everyone realises that the consumer is highly demanding and properly so. The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly a precious few times. And I think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay. Good is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.</blockquote>
<p>The first bit makes sense regardless of whether you agree with it, given we're talking about the species that made the three most recent Fast and Furious films highly lucrative ventures. Then, towards the end, Zelnick seems to lose track of what words actually mean, even if those words are inherently subjective in terms of which games they apply to. I can just about stomach "good is the new bad," given it's just expressing how games that perceivedly fall short of greatness arguably face a tougher challenge nowadays due to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">sheer saturation of "good" games out there</a>.</p>
<p>But what does "great is the new great" mean? I'd get it if he'd just said making a great game is great for business. How can making a great game be the new making a great game? They're the same thing, surely. Zelnick then goes on to say that Take-Two are aiming to "make everything exceptional". He's clearly just run out of superlatives above great, because it's impossible for "everything" to be "exceptional" by definition.</p>
<p>The use of the word makes sense if he means this specifically in terms of Take-Two's output in comparison to the rest of the industry, but I think he needs to bite the hyperbole bullet and commit to saying he's aiming for nothing less than super-mega-fantastic-one-of-a-kind-uber-masterpieces, which will simultaneously not be one-of-a-kind, because <em>all</em> of Take-Two's games will be like that.</p>
<p>I get that this is just one bit of CEO talk, but verging on breaking the English language maybe conveys how much the industry's moneyfolks are losing the plot when it comes to the expectations - fuelled by a perceived need to make unfathomable amounts of money for a release not to be a total failure - that they heap upon their own games. By all means aim to make a great game, but if every game's got to be great because good is bad, how long is it until we've burned through the whole dictionary?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-is-not-ok-good-is-bad-great-is-the-new-great-and-bioshock-4-is-coming-out-as-take-two-boss-stops-short-of-claiming-that-up-is-down]]></content:encoded>
