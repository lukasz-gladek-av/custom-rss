            <p>Cronenburgian body horror shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ill">Ill</a> shared more sick filth at the Summer Game Fest, with a trailer that shows the freakish pale abominations you'll be dismembering as you travel through some horrifying concrete manifestation of your own unwellness. Ah, no wait, it's a fort where bad experiments happened. My bad, too much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-gets-a-release-date-plus-a-creepy-new-trailer-with-more-limb-cracking-noises-than-a-chiropractor-convention">Silent Hill going around</a>. Anyway, here's the trailer. There's a bit where a monster gets his arm blown off and I actually whince. Poor freak.</p>

<p>Definitely one for the photorealism fans out there. But it's not just about admiring (?) the wobbling flesh and unhealthy pallor of your enemies, says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/">the Steam page</a>. Your weapons are designed to be a bit more frictional than your average FPS. </p>
<p>"Experience a comprehensive weapon system where malfunction checks, ammunition types, and mandatory maintenance are crucial. Feel the weight and realism of each weapon in the protagonistâ€™s hands, thanks to procedural animation that considers physical characteristics."</p>
<p>Ill was once known as "Project Ill" and began life as a concept trailer from a couple of brothers making horribly detailed fear with Unreal Engine. Since then it has grown to become a realistic horror shooter, albeit one in which you'll still have to do the requisite video game crafting and scavenging. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week, IO Interactive showed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">the first trailer</a> for their long-awaited Bond game, 007: First Light. Now they're bringing a bit of Bond back to their most famous creation, Hitman: World Of Assassination. Starting today, a new Elusive Target has been added to the game: Le Chiffre, as depicted Mads Mikkelsen in Casino Royale. There's a trailer below.

<p>The new target was announced during this evening's Summer Game Fest stream. Apparently Mads will be added to Hitmads in a few hours from when I'm writing this, and will be available in-game to kill for 30 days. If you play it, you'll unlock some sort of reward in 007: First Light when it launches next year.
</p>
<p>World Of Assassination is what the modern Hitman trilogy morphed into once IO Interactive had finished it and grown tired of releasing their games in the most complicated bundle of products possible. It contains all the levels and story modes from Hitman 1-3, various challenges modes, a roguelike mode, and a rotating cast of Elusive Targets, often based on celebrities or famed fictional characters. Mads is following in Sean Bean's footsteps, basically.
</p>
<p>Whenever Le Chiffre arrives, you'll be able to grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/">via Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
