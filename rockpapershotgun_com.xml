            <p>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: "person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it".  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69u_Pxb_8zI">where the rivers in Skyrim go</a>, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>. This is vital work. This is important work.</p>

<p>This act of, uh, "research" has been performed by YouTuber Allie Meowy, who spends an hour taking the viewer step-by-step through the various bathroom belt unbucklings and musing on each urination with a critical lens that absolutely nobody deemed necessary. That's great. I won't spoil exactly how many pees you can pee in the choice-heavy crime thriller. You'll have to watch the video (or skip through it) to find out. I will say it's not a huge or impressive number. It is a very plain amount of pees for a story that follows four people over four days. But it's not the number of pees that's important, it's the stains we found along the way. </p>
<p>"We will build on our knowledge of the piss mechanics throughout this video," says Alllie, with an alarming amount of straight-faced  professionalism. "In most games you shoot people and it means nothing. In Heavy Rain, you piss and the narrative is very slightly enhanced. And you know what? I think that's beautiful."</p><p>As anyone who has ever yelled "Jason" in a shopping mall can attest, Heavy Rain is a magnet for irony. It is impossible to enjoy this (or arguably any game by Quantic Dream) without cackling out loud at certain moments. For all their desire to be grand, meaningful works of art, these games are laden with nonsense, both intentional and unintentional. </p>
<p>Yet the video is not just a litany of gags at the expense of 2010's best and worst choose-your-own-misery game. As the piss countdown progresses, Allie's intense scrutiny results in some weirdly interesting observations. For example, Madison, the only playable woman in the story, flushes the toilet automatically, whereas all male characters require the player to activate the flush themselves. In many instances, you will pee and be unable to wash your hands. You will often eat or rub your face soon afterwards. </p>
<p>The piss is not dynamically tracked by the game, she also notes. You can drink carton after carton of orange juice and you will never become bursting to go. And some of the bathrooms in the game's US setting (not-quite-Philadelphia) lack a sink because that's how some bathrooms exist in real life France, where the game's designers were based. </p>
<p>"You can easily go the whole game without taking a piss even once," observes Allie. "I don't know why you'd want to do that but it technically is an option for players who prefer a pissless play style."</p>
<p>And just like that "pissless playstyle" has become one of my favourite phrases of the year so far. </p>
<p>The video also acts as a surprisingly thorough breakdown of the game's storyline. If you have never played Heavy Rain, and can't face doing a whole playthrough yourself, I can now recommend this as the definitive way to have the story summarised. Yes, the focus is on urine. Yes, the word piss occurs approximately 150 times in the course of the video. But I have probably learned more about this Cage game in the past hour than I did after two playthroughs when it first released. </p><p>Pee is on the brain here at RPS, it seems. I recently reviewed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, a mechanic sim in which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">drink your own wizz</a> to reduce both your thirst bar and urine bar at the same time. Meanwhile, first-piss-on-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urge">Urge</a> got Edwin's attention for being "the most interesting open world shooter in a long while, and also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/urge-is-the-most-interesting-open-world-shooter-in-a-long-while-and-also-the-most-revolting">the most revolting</a>". Anyway. That's all the piss we have for the moment, reader. Now, wash your hands.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Here's your feelgood story for the weekend, possibly: the creators of megahit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> are using some of their Palbucks to set up a new publishing arm, and their first project as publisher is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios, the struggling developers of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Intriguingly, this doesn't appear to be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tales-of-kenzera-devs-are-making-a-gothic-horror-rpg-beat-em-up-where-two-characters-fight-over-one-body">"Project Uso"</a> Surgent revealed last October, which founder Abubakar Salim described as both a reflection on the experience of fatherhood and "a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy". According to Salim, that game was set in the same world as the studio's debut Afrofuturist platformer. Their new game for Pocketpair isn't. Instead, it's being positioned as a game "about" the entertainment industry.
</p>
<p>
"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks," Salim comments in statements shared with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/pocketpair-launches-publishing-arm-partners-with-surgent-studios-for-first-title">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it."
</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean there won't be another Kenzera game, mind. "We're still in an earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going," Salim added.
</p><p>
It's certainly a timely turn of events for Surgent. While pretty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">well-reviewed</a>, Tales Of Kenzera appears to have sold much worse than hoped. Surgent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-studio-founded-by-assassins-creed-origins-actor-lay-off-staff-less-than-three-months-after-debut-game">laid off around a dozen staff</a> in July last year, just three months after release, and subsequently put their whole games division on hiatus. 
</p>
<p>
It's also a timely turn of events for Pocketpair, who are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement</a>. In case you've been living under a boulder since last winter, the studio's reputation-making poach-me-do has plenty in common with the Pokémon series, though Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">appear secure, at least, against the separate charge of copyright theft</a>.</p>
<p>Salim's canned statements about Pocketpair "taking risks" ring true here, though I'm not sure they accurately describe the game's design. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> ain't too bad as monster-bagging base-builders go, but it won't be winning any awards for imagination.
</p>
<p>
All of which leaves me curious about the above "pattern in the entertainment industry" Surgent intend to target. Salim has been outspoken on the subject of racism in the games industry and community, so perhaps that'll be the focus. Or perhaps the Pal-published game will pit you against some rotund, mustachioed lawyers who are accompanied by cuddly electric pissmonsters that look absolutely nothing like Pikachu.
