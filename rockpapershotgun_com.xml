            <p>Massive modding site Nexus Mods have announced a change in ownership, with founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott set to step back. As to who the new owners are, a couple of first names and modding profiles have been provided, as well as an assertion that these new overlords understand what makes Nexus Mods tick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-on-paid-mods">Scott</a> - who founded the site as the Elder Scrolls-focused TES Nexus in 2001, and has owned it via his company Black Tree Gaming since 2007 - announced the news via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a post</a> on Nexus Mods.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll," Scott wrote, "The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. </p>
<p>"So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve."</p>
<p>Following "months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching", he believes he's found new ownership that will "understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community".</p>
<p>Scott added: "I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate “exit” or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself."</p>
<p>So, who's taking over Nexus Mods? Well, further on in the post, Scott introduces folks called Victor and Marinus, linking to their Nexus Mods profiles under the handles <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> and <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a>, and revealing that they've "come on board to lead this next chapter".</p>
<p>"They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here," he wrote, later adding "they’re about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform."</p>
<p>Taking a look at the profiles of these two, whose full names haven't been provided, you can see that they've been given the same 'site owner' tag Scott's account currently boasts. "For the past decade, I’ve been building platforms in gaming and UGC," Foledinho's profile bio says, citing his goal with Nexus Mods as being to "help make modding easier, where games evolve through the hands of players."</p>
<p>Rapsak, meanwhile, "started producing music on a PlayStation at eight years old and eventually became a DJ, touring internationally and playing shows with music I’d made myself. 

"At the same time, I was diving deeper into tech, building PCs at 13, launching my first business at 15 (a DJ booking system), and writing code every chance I got," he goes on. Rapsak also notes that he only ever wears black T-shirts, which is "not a fashion thing, just one less decision to make in the morning." Ok then.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods for comment.</p>
<p>According to Scott, the ownership change shouldn't result in much of a change in terms of the day-to-day user experience on Nexus Mods in the near future, with its "team of 40 incredibly dedicated people, some of whom have been here for over nine years" still in place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Your firepower's still on the weak side, SteamyBladers</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> modders have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">a lot of sexual stuff</a> so far. As it turns out, the game's director is cool with that, though he is hoping that despite the game not having any official tools, modders'll have a go at creating fresh wrinkles that add to what the Stellar Blade experience offers.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim gave his opinion on where the game's modding scene is currently at in a recent interview with South Korean site <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-director-doesnt-plan-to-police-modders-but-would-like-them-to-be-mature-and-stay-within-reason-with-what-they-make/">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1934199332787679533">Genki</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the director's general view on Stellar Blade modding's pretty positive. He doesn't see the need to interfere with them except by encouraging folks from being careful with or avoiding stuff that could mess up their base game. Exactly the kind of view you'd hope a developer would have, rather than panicking and calling the lawyers the moment someone figures out how to replace a texture.</p>
<p>He's also cool with the idea of folks making reams of NSFW stuff like nice suits for the game, since Stellar Blade has a strong rating and is therefore aimed at adults. I'd caveat that as adults you might find a bit weird, but I digress. To be clear you can do the dirty to whatever floats your boat, as long as it's not doing any harm. The trouble with Stellar Blade has been misogynistic players and online dicks treating Eve, jiggle physics et al, as an example of how all women should look in games - see some of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/reviews/?browsefilter=funny&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the director's less of a fan of paid mods that charge high prices, but generally seems to trust players not to engage with anything that crosses a line or involve material that could be classed as harmful or sensitive.</p>
<p>All of that said, Kim is keen to see Stellar Blade modders spread their wings a bit. While acknowledging that the game's lack of official tools will likely make this more difficult, the director's interested in seeing folks make mods that switch up what it's like to play the game, but without straying too far from its original vision.</p>
<p>According to Genki's translation, that wish was accompanied by Kim using the killer phrase "modders' firepower is still weak", as part of suggesting that he thinks the current crop of new cosmetics and minor tweaks don't go much beyond the stuff the base game offers. Which, to be fair, is the norm for games that haven't been out on PC long.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to see if the SteamyBladers accept this challenge, put aside their jiggle physics manipulation for a second, open up new tabs that cover their pretty out there desktop backgrounds, and set about pushing the limits of modding potential rather than the limits of taste. You can do it, high-five Stellar Blade modde...actually, you know what, maybe not. I don't know where that mitt's been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
