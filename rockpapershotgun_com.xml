            <p>Fans of damp tunnels and chatty skeletons may have enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lunacid">Lunacid</a>, a first-person dungeon crawler which left early access in October 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">called it</a> “lo-fi first-person dungeon skulking done right” and suggested that it “could well earn a place in some best of the year lists”. (It didn’t appear on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2023">ours</a>, but in fairness, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devoured everybody’s brain.) </p>
<p>Lunacid takes copious inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developer FromSoftware’s old Shadow Tower and King’s Field games for PS1. Now, creators KIRA LLC are going even further with Lunacid: Tears Of The Moon - a new RPG made using FromSoftware’s ancient Sword Of Moonlight: King’s Field game creation tools from 2000, which came with hundreds of map parts, objects and characters plus scripting features and the ability to insert AVI movies and even a credits reel.</p><!--more-->
<p><a href="https://en.swordofmoonlight.org/wiki/Sword_of_Moonlight">Officially released only in Japan</a>, Sword Of Moonlight granted buyers unlimited use of the King's Field intellectual property, including the right to release and sell their own games. While hardly the Unity Engine of its day, it fostered a quietly thriving fangame scene with projects such as <a href="https://kings-field.neocities.org/som/dom/info">Diadem Of Maunstraut</a> finding an audience overseas.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t jive with elderly fangames, Lunacid - Tears of the Moon has charm. Like many a FromSoftwork, it takes place in a fallen kingdom and sees you journeying underground to soothe/defeat a restless cosmic being. Not being familiar with Sword Of Moonlight, I can’t say how much it tests the capabilities of FromSoftware’s 25-year-old toolset, but I enjoy the lurid smog of the dungeons and the lumbering choreography of the first-person combat.</p>
<p>Tears Of The Moon will release on 12th April 2025 - here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3506110/Lunacid__Tears_of_the_Moon/">Steam page</a>. While reading up on Sword Of Moonlight, I also stumbled on <a href="https://swordofmoonlight.itch.io/k">this King’s Field 2 preservation project</a>, which makes use of the same tools. It seems like a noble enterprise, though sadly the creator has run into difficulties following a schizophrenia diagnosis. If you’re checking out Tears Of The Moon, maybe show this some love, too.</p>
<p>Thanks to SeekerX for spotting this one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Konami have given us our first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, a new incarnation of the survival horror series from Hong Kong-based Neobards Entertainment, which takes place in 1960s Japan. You are Shimizu Hinako, a schoolgirl equipped with the trademark Silent Hill combo of a broken-off pipe and a cartload of psychological baggage, whose hometown Ebisugaoka is engulfed by a monstrous fog.</p>
<p>The choice of a non-US setting has ruffled the plumage of players who cherish Silent Hill's association with Twin Peaks and New England. Personally, I welcome the departure after the heady retro fidelity of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and besides, the overall ambience doesn't seem <em>that</em> far removed from the elder Hills. Look, they've even got Akira Yamaoka contributing to the soundtrack. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It looks like Silent Hill's trademark dimension shifts are back as well, but the new game's realm shifts appear to be more bio-horror-ish, with crimson roots and lambent, trumpet-shaped blossoms consuming the geometry rather than Silent Hill's usual flavour of blood, rust and toilet bowl detritus. It's almost pretty, as you might expect from a game that challenges you to "embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead". Perhaps the "f" in the title stands for "flower". Or perhaps it stands for "face peeling off". Or perhaps it stands for "flipping get a move on and embed the trailer".

I've never heard of Neobards before, and naturally, I'm wondering whether they have the chops to pull a Silent Hill game off. Founded in 2017, they've worked in a support capacity on games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a> and several Resident Evil projects. They appear to have one first-party release to their name, the mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> M. I don't know what to make of them, but I will give them kudos for having a poem on <a href="https://neobards.com/game-maker/">their portfolio page</a> that (accidentally?) references the Three Musketeers.  
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f also features writing from Ryukishi07, author of the When They Cry visual novel series. The plot certainly seems to be in keeping with his taste for the macabre: according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/">the Steam page</a>, the game "contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence". The developers say that some of this difficult material reflects "the customs and culture" of the day. They're probably not talking about the dislocated dolls on stabby stick legs, which strike me as horrifying regardless of era.
</p>
<p>
If you're genuinely floored and flummoxed by this being set in Japan, you might prefer to see it as a spiritual successor to Forbidden Siren, the PS2 survival horror game Keiichiro Toyama directed and co-wrote after co-writing and directing the original Silent Hill. I remember having a ripe old time in Siren lurking behind barrels "sight-jacking" manky Shibito. If it had ever made it to PC, I'd have volunteered it for our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>.
