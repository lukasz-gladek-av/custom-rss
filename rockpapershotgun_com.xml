            <p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s reveal trailer later today, July 24th, the camo-clad shooter's release date appears to have been shot out into the universe by a leaker.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time EA's latest instalment of putting bullets in faces while someone shouts orders in your ear has been subject to some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">leaks</a>. This time it's Dealabs' Billbil-kun, who'se got a strong track record when it comes to pulling back the covers on details about games and hardware prior to official reveals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267">the report</a>, an October 10th release date previously dug up by a group of folks on Telegram going by 1BF is accurate. Billbil-kun claims that there'll be no paid early access bollocks happening around that date, either, writing that both the standard and swankier 'Phantom' editions of the game will both debut on the 10th.</p>
<p>The report cites the open beta that EA cheekily mentioned in a tweet about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-let-battlefield-6-players-lock-weapons-to-classes-in-latest-scuffle-over-how-much-battlefield-should-enforce-teamwork">how weapons and classes will work</a> the other day as being set to take place in August. It also claims pre-order will kick off at the end of this month.</p>

<p>As for pricing, Dealabs being French means that all of Billbil-kun's reported figures are in Euros. They've got the standard edition pegged at €69.99 on PC, with the 'Phantom' deluxe version at the more lofty €99.99 and an upgrade you can buy to bump your standard up to swanky ghost status being €29.99.</p>
<p>Converting storefront prices is always a bit of crapshoot, so we'll just have to wait and see what these look like in his maj's finest pounds and US double dollars with extra cheese.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6's reveal is set to take place this afternoon, so make sure you're suited, booted, and have put on your finest urban camo underpants in time for 4PM BST / 11AM ET / 8AM PT / 5PM CEST. According to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reports</a>, EA execs are hoping that whatever's shown will help attract 100 million people to sign up to be shipped off to do some virtual killing. Likely involving a lot of shuffling about with an assault rifle and a walkie talkie. Got all that? Ok, over and out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-release-date-appears-to-have-leaked-jumping-the-gun-ahead-of-its-reveal-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The exact difference between a cool, fun sci-fi reference and a tiresome, please get out of my house and into the sea sci-fi reference will remain a mystery to me, but I haven't seen anyone try and do Milliways from Hitchhiker's Guide as a management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> yet, so sure, I'll bite.</p>
<p>Things do start off firmly in Mos Eisley territory though. You recycle industrial trash heaps to clear space for dining rooms, where the shanky lookin' clientele sit on rusted barrels and order a soup made from canonically repulsive beans. The advisor informs me the beans taste so awful that they used to be illegal. This implies the existence of some sort of rough-edged intergalactic bean squad. See if you can spot them in the trailer below. </p>

<p>"Grow exotic ingredients, create a menu that appeals to intergalactic palates, and discover treasures in the outer worlds," boast the demo-enriched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2577420/The_Diner_at_the_End_of_the_Galaxy">Steam</a> and <a href="https://general-interactive-co.itch.io/diner-at-the-end-of-the-galaxy">Itch.io</a> pages for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-diner-at-the-end-of-the-galaxy">The Diner At The End Of The Galaxy</a>. After I've built a kitchen and a small garden, I realise you can name your own dishes. Apparently 'beans' is already a recipe, however.</p>

<p>Aside from spacebux and ingredients, the main resource you'll be hunting after here is fame. Make customers happy with exciting new recipes and slightly less awful chairs to sit on, and they'll go tell their space mates how great you are. I do like it when a management game tangibly rewards you for spiffing up the joint. You can also send a ship off to explore space for treasure. Who knows what new and interesting legumes lurk in the forbidden corners of the cosmos? Things might go terribly out there, of course, but the ends justify the beans.</p>
<p>It's from General Interactive Co, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/terroir-wine-game-release">wine making sim Terroir</a> and interesting-but-flawed adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chinatown-detective-agency">Chinatown Detective Agency</a> fame. The full game is due out this year. Uh, Glup Shitto Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster Tribbles Greedo Slartibartfast Babel Fish amirite? There, sorted.</p>
<p>(Also, there's a typo in this demo that asks you to click the 'left moust button'. I'm not even mad at it. Moust!)</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commit-culinary-crimes-in-management-sim-the-diner-at-the-end-of-the-galaxy]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Thousands of projects under the NSFW category have been delisted</p>

            <p>Thousands of creators today found their Itch.io projects missing from the online storefront - effectively delisted to anyone searching or browsing the site. Others still are reporting<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luolkqglj22c"> actual takedowns "with no notice"</a>, halted payouts, and those who have previously purchased their games <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luolkqglj22c">being unable to download them</a>.</p>
<p>Going by one image posted on the Itch Discord and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luounfexf22c">shared on Bluesky</a> by game developer Daffodil, filtering by the site's 'NSFW' category previously showed 28,114 results. It now shows 7,008.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After creators were left in limbo for several hours, Itch.io posted <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">a statement</a> clarifying that they'd "deindexed" all NSFW work content from their browse and search pages, following "a campaign" against them and Steam by the Collective Shout organisation, that targeted payment providers "due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April".</p>
<p>Collective Shout describe themselves as a "grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls", but are associated with outspokenly homophobic and anti-abortion Christian conservative groups, according to a <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">now-deleted Vice article</a>. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit for the campaign</a> that saw payment providers pressuring the online storefronts to remove content the group deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," reads Itch's statement. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance."</p>
<p>"This is a time critical moment for itch.io," the statement continues. "The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change."</p>
<p>It's not hard to empathise with the folks behind Itch for being placed in an impossible position, but their lack of forewarning has left creators blindsided and in some cases, seemingly without income. "I wish we had gotten some warning from Steam and Itch," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3luokzr44d22p">wrote game developer Robert Yang</a> on Bluesky, "but we already know it's Collective Shout + payment processors waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression. I guess there's nothing else for Steam and Itch to say".</p>
<p>Itch say they're currently "conducting a comprehensive audit" to meet their payment processor's requirements, and that affected pages will remain "deindexed" in the meantime. New compliance measures will follow. "For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".</p>
<p>"Part of this will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io," the statement concludes. We can get an idea of the parameters here from Itch's own notices sent to some creators. These include "sexualised images or videos of real-life humans", "AI generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people", "content glorifying sexual violence", and that depicting "minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors". Which, taken in good faith, are all in line with what you'd expect and hope for.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I'd be willing to extend that good faith to Itch.io themselves, but they aren't the one holding the gun to their own heads here. That'd be financial companies, pressured by Collective Shout, who themselves have ties to an organisation whose CEO once described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God". It's not difficult to imagine what kind of expression these groups might decide to deem as unacceptable next.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, here we go, this is gonna have to be be quicker than the tempo of your average Motorhead thrashathon. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brutal-legend">Brütal Legend</a>, the heavy metal action-adventure Double Fine put out on console back in 2009 (before coming to their senses and doing a PC port in 2013), is free to grab as I write this, but won't be for much longer.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/22/ozzy-osbourne-black-sabbath-frontman-and-icon-of-british-heavy-metal-dies-aged-76">the death</a> of Black Sabbath frontman and general face of the metal Ozzy Osbourne earlier this week, the studio have decided to give out the game in which he talks to a roadie voiced by Jack Black for zilch. However, it's a deal that kicked off in the dead of the night UK time, and isn't set to run for much longer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Brütal Legend became <a href="https://doublefine.itch.io/brutal-legend">free to claim </a>via PC storefront Itch.io right as July 23rd flipped over into July 24rd (UK time-wise) this morning, with the deal running for a very apt 666 minutes. That equates to 11 hours or so, meaning that as I write this, you've got just under an hour and a half left to claim the game without paying a penny.</p>
<p>Well, unless you decide you want to make a tip/donation to the devs, as Itch allows you to do on checkout. If you do take up the deal, you get versions of the game for Windows and Ubuntu, plus both 64 and 32 bit Mac editions.</p>

But this incredible deal will only last for 666 minutes, as the prophecy foretold. So get yourself clicking, before it disappears like a demon in the night...

</span></p><p>Osbourne famously plays The Guardian of Metal in Brutal Legend, an immortal keeper of secrets who also sells weapon upgrades to you, because video game. The likes of Lemmy, Rob Halford, and Lita Ford are among the other legendary players of the guitar-ish music that Black-voiced roadie protagonist Eddie Riggs encounters as he battles his way through both action slashing combat and real time strategy. Because, like a lot of bands, Brütal Legend can't quite bring itself to wholeheartedly commit to a single genre.</p>
<p>Our Alec wrote the following about it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutal-legend-review-pc">when it debuted on PC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Brütal Legend looks wonderful, and it feels wonderful, but it isn't quite wonderful, not really. It's ideas without an anchor and, I am quite sure, were any developer other than Double Fine attempting to stitch these floating fancies together this game would frequently be intolerable. Fortunately it is Double Fine, and the game's wit, charm and huge personality, both in writing and in visual style, do turn out to be capable bindings for the loose collective of brainstorming within.</blockquote>
<p>Now, quickly, grab that metal and get to shredding in the name of Birmingham's finest conductor of kooky locomotives.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutal-legend-goes-free-to-grab-as-double-fine-pay-tribute-to-ozzy-osbourne-but-youll-have-be-quick]]></content:encoded>
