            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over. I'm sure everyone let out a final burst of fire that sounded equally triumphant and tragic at its conclusion. But wait, say EA, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lovers, where do you all think you're going?</p>
<p>It's at this point the publishers whip out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, the much-maligned at release previous entry in the series, like they're yanking a rabbit out of a marine's helmet. He's not Battlefield 2042 anymore, they say, he's the "road to Battlefield 6". A road one can only assume is littered with IEDs and checkpoints where five people are standing around looking mean. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This boulevard to blast central is update 9.2, and it's chunky enough that I'd class it as a full-on repaint the road markings affair. Classic map Iwo Jima makes its 2042 debut, with "boat landings, bunkers, and trenches on a reimagined 700x200 map". Oh, and an active volcano in case you want to renounce your warlike ways and take up volcanology.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there are two new guns - the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. Only the former's being dished out to everyone, with the Lynx only being given to folks who played the Battlefield 6 beta to start with. EA insist anyone who didn't hop into the beta will get a chance to grab it "later down the line". Meanwhile, two new attack jets, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot, have been added in. EA say they come with some revamped abilities and are designed to be "vehicle busters".</p><div>

<p>That sounds a bit rough for folks down below, trundling along the "road to Battlefield 6" in tanks or jeeps. Anyway, I'll drop the metaphor. The "road to Battlefield 6" is actually a 60-tiered free battle pass featuring a bunch of gear inspired by the series' history. It includes some stuff to unlock for Battlefield 6 itself and will run from August 18th to October 7th.</p>
<p>If you want a reminder of what Battlefield 2042 was like when it first debuted, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">Ed's review</a>. It's also evolved a fair bit since then, so a run through our 2042 news archives is probably a good shout if you want cluing up on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">some of the changes EA have made</a> over the years.</p>

        <p>New Free Ride mode to tune up currently barren exploration</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> may be an offer you can probably refuse, but it does have a lush-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> - "clearly designed with care and a sharp eye for capturing the beauty of a fairytale landscape that alternates between serene and rugged," as Mark "Ice Pick" Warren <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">wrote in our review</a>. </p>
<p>The game's focus on shootybangs and stabfights does the backdrop a disservice, as does its rather barren and easy-to-miss Exploration mode, which I hear is basically a chance to snaffle up some collectibles. Devs Hangar 13 and their godfathers at 2K Games aim to fix all that with a forthcoming Free Ride mode, which will "add some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months," according to a developer update.</p>
<p>Hangar 13's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> also had a Free Ride mode, which let you roam Lost Heaven taking on new missions and races and even tussling with alien invaders. I would assume The Old Country's version will be similar in both content and direction. Can't wait to see what flying saucers look like in 1900s Sicily.</p>
<p>I'm always happy when blockbuster devs add modes that encourage you to revisit and savour the texture of the world. Projects such as Mafia: The Old Country typically pour tens of millions into the creation of art assets that are doomed to be appreciated for around five seconds while players zip fecklessly from cover to cover.</p><p>I guess that mingled decadence and disposability is part of the triple-A thrill, like burning 100 dollar bills to light a cigar. Have you ever done that? I once set a five pound note on fire for a dare, but I extinguished it immediately and, I think, bought a coffee with it. This is why I will never run 2K Games.</p>
<p>Again, there's no hard launch date yet for Free Ride in Mafia: The Old Country. In the shorter term, Mark has dug up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-now-has-a-first-person-driving-mod-thats-ideal-for-capo-cruisin-when-its-not-utterly-terrifying">a first-person driving mod</a>, which allows you to savour the period detail at the modest expense of occasionally seeing your own eyeballs floating in front of your face.</p>
