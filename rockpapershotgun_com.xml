            <p>Pre-release builds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> recently unearthed at a shop in Utah contain rare files which could be "incredibly useful" to expanding what modders can do with the RPG. Well, at least they doe in the estimation of the folks who claim to have found them, a group of preservationists whose current online presence only looks to have popped up last month.</p>

<p>According to the group, who go by Games' Past, they picked up these builds by buying some dev-kits which had been sitting around on a shelf for a year. They cite the betas contained in the kits as being from July 21st and August 22nd, 2010, with some bits of a build from April that year also having been found. For reference, New Vegas came out in October 2010.</p>
<p>The video mainly focuses on the July build, showing off a bunch of cut content it includes. Some of this stuff, like Mr House's robo-girlfriend Marilyn, has previously been <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72209">unearthed and restored</a> by modders, but other bits don't immediately come up if you search 'cut content' on New Vegas' Nexus Mods page.</p><p>There's an encounter with a wasteland adventurer who spoils the fun right after you leave Goodsprings by telling you in no uncertain terms that heading north through Quarry Junction's a bad idea, a less annoyingly-voiced Oliver Swanick, and an early version of Mr House's screen which makes him look a lot more like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> character. The video also flips between versions of the game, showing off some minor differences in how certain locations look.</p>
<p>Cool, but things get more interesting later in the video, when its narrator Ventura claims the builds could play a key role in helping expand what's possible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">current day New Vegas modding</a>. "All three builds came with intact PDBs (program database files), which have never been leaked before for any version of Fallout New Vegas, or for any game before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> for that matter," they asserted. "For those who aren't aware, the PDB file is an extremely important file to modders, as it is a file generated while the game is being built that contains much additional debugging information, which is incredibly useful for reverse engineering the game and understanding not only how the game functions, but the engine behind it as well."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that comes to pass, but unless they've previously gone by a different name, this looks to be the first act of publicly visible preservation Games' Past have done. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamesPastOrg">YouTube channel</a> only hosts this one video, while both it and their <a href="https://x.com/GamesPastOrg">Twitter account</a> were only created in October 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it does make me a bit more hesitant to immediately trust their modding assertions than I would be if they were an established organisation with a visibly substantial track record for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like the wastelander who's keen not to see you become Deathclaw food, time'll prove I'm just being a bit too cautious.</p>

            <p>A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647">trademark</a>, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1ST</a>, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as "audio, video and multimedia production" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it.</p>
<p>The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-announces-the-result-of-the-share-issue/">acted on Remedy's behalf</a> numerous times in the recent past, including <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-listing/">advising on the company's stock exchange listing</a> and <a href="https://nordialaw.com/case-remedys-contract-negotiation-with-annapurna/">helping negotiate</a> the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>'s development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">partnership deal from last year</a>, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction.</p><p>Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.</p>
