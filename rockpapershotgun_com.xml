Online video games! They're the future of the medium! Or, I guess they're already here, but still, online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> is very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivor's</a> future. It's a feature that's been promised for a little while now, and developer Poncle have shared a little look at it, as well as a confirmation as to when you can expect it: autumn! This autumn, to be precise, which we're currently experiencing, though a more specific window of time wasn't provided.
</p>
<p>
In a short but sweet little trailer, which shows how all you need to do to make a game online is by pressing the online button (that fabled button far too many people think is effectively real), Poncle showed the simple steps you need to take to go online. You start by setting up a lobby with a unique ID, and when your friends (or enemies) start to join, it'll show you what DLC is and isn't available to play through, presumably depending on whether everyone involved owns a specific piece or not.

<p>
After that, everyone selects their character of choice, and you get to surviving vampires! There's also a short, jokey comment that I genuinely find quite fascinating: "We know no one plays together anyway lmao." This doesn't surprise me! As someone who's put a good few hours into Vampire Survivors, I can't see the appeal of playing with someone else in the slightest, it's a game I play to completely shut off - perhaps shutting off with someone else is the appeal for some, or just having something other than a fidget cube to play around with in your hands while yapping on Discord.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this feature still exists, because clearly either enough people have asked for it, no matter how small a number, or Poncle wanted the option there for anyone who might ever want it. There's a value in options like these, options for requests that come from the minority, and as long as they can be completed relatively sustainably, I hope we see more of them. Yes, I know I'm reading too much into what is obviously a joke! That is the curse called writing, I'm afraid.
</p><p>
In any case, Poncle also said there's another announcement coming next week which looks like it has something to do with someone in a crappy skeleton custom in the woods. There's also a visual suggestion that there'll be more announcements in the weeks following that one, so I guess there's big plans for update 1.4 you'll have to keep an eye out for!
