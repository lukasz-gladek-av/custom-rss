            <p>
I feel like money laundering is one of those concepts you see in a lot of crime TV shows but it's not really something that seems to come up much in games. I certainly can't think of any games that feature money laundering as an actual mechanic, but I'll be able to add one to the list next week: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game is getting a new update this coming June 17th called <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/513kao973a73ko/gta-online-money-fronts-coming-june-17">Money Fronts</a>, and is literally all about buying up small but generally lucrative businesses that you can sneak some money through.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a few businesses you'll be able to pick up but you'll be starting off with a classic: the car wash, specifically Hands On Car Wash. You'll get passive income through this from your criminal network, eventually allowing you to pick up the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, all of which will also bring in their own money from actual, legal business operations.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pro of lots of moola, there is a big con too. Operating these businesses this way will generate heat, and if that gets too high, you'll have to actually step in as the local business owner you're pretending to be to manage these companies the way they're legally meant to be.
</p>
<p>
There's a few new rides you can pick up too, like the Karin Everon RS or the Declasse Tampa GT (Muscle). Money Fronts is also bringing in some gameplay tweaks. More than 50 vehicles will have missile lock-on jammer capability, and all sources of arena points are being doubled. A number of cutscenes will be skippable on mission replays too, though which ones that'll be weren't specified.
</p>
<p>
More details will be coming, uh, at some point, Rockstar just said "stay tuned". You only have to wait a few days for it anyway, you'll live.

            <p>
I'm not much of an MMO person, I've dabbled over the years like with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> in my youth, and a bit of Final Fantasy 14. These days it's the level of commitment that puts me off, even though I really do love being able to partake in what feels like living, breathing worlds, the hustle and bustle of actual people going to and fro. Luckily, I think I have a lower-key way to get this kind of feeling in the upcoming action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> Starlight Re:Volver.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right from the first second of Starlight Re:Volver you'll absolutely be thinking to yourself "oh, this is anime as hell." That'll be offputting to some, maybe, but it does so with such a ridiculous degree of finesse and style, I was won over right out the gate. The core gameplay loop is that you set out on runs with up to three of your friends, going through different rooms with waves of enemies across them, picking up abilities and buffs along the way.

<p>
It definitely seems like there's a Hades-like approach to the game, though the demo that's currently available for Steam Next Fest is more like an online playtest above all else. Right now I'd say there's a bit of an onboarding issue, as the game doesn't really do much to tell you much about anything, but with multiple characters to choose from all with unique playstyles, I had a fun enough time in the few runs I went through.
</p>
<p>
All of that can be smoothed over of course, I'm not that worried about that, so the real thing that's pulling me in so far is the vibes. The game's Steam page refers to itself as an "anime-inspired MMO universe", and the game's hub area certainly offers a slice of such a pie up.
</p>
<p>
There's an in-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a> rip-off to play, a fishing mini-game, clothes to unlock, different areas to just hang out in. You can see different players running around too, and even if there's not much to do right now, it really does capture that specific feeling of being in a virtual place with a whole bunch of strangers.
</p>
<p>
How that may progress whenever the game comes out, I can't tell you, it's certainly something I hope to see expanded upon. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201010/Starlight_ReVolver/">here</a>, and you have until June 16th to try out the demo for yourself.

            <p>
It's a crossover episode! Like the great team-ups of the past (Scooby-Doo and Batman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/totally-accurate-battle-simulator">Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/landfall-games">Landfall</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/aggro-crab">Aggro Crab</a> have come to make Peak. As in it's literally called Peak, not a qualitative descriptor that's been more widely adopted into Gen-Z slang that you have to Google because you're not a spring chicken anymore.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Peak is an aptly named game too, as it's all about climbing mountains. This being a game made by both Landfall and Aggro Crab, this obviously comes with a certain amount of silliness. Your virtual avatar is one that I can only describe as a "little guy", who you can apparently customise with different outfits and accessories. It's also playable in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, in fact that kind of seems to be the main selling point, but you can go solo too.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>our new game PEAK is a climbing game with friends where the slightest mistake can spell your doom🗻</p><p>reach the top of the mountain as a group of scouts when it drops JUNE 16‼️ <a href="https://t.co/5EADzD6gWd">pic.twitter.com/5EADzD6gWd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1933541312315236620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
The whole goal is to get to the top of the mountain (otherwise known as the peak of the mountain, if I need to spell it out for you), in hopes of being rescued after having crash landed on a mysterious island. There's four biomes to wade through, and along the way you'll have to pick up food to keep yourself going. You can get injured too, so unlike the example provided in the trailer above, you probably shouldn't punt your med kit off the side of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, a majority of the game was made within a one month game jam, so you shouldn't necessarily expect infinite content or whatever it is shareholders want these days. It just looks like a silly, goofy way to hang out with some friends for a few hours. It's also out really soon! June 16th to be precise, so you've only got a couple of days to wait. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">here</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">Sony</a> have been making a lot of mistakes over the past couple of years, including things like mistakenly thinking they could <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">release 12 live service games by 2026</a>, but the more immediately annoying one is its whole PSN thing. I probably don't need to remind you of that whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fiasco, where they tried to make logging into a PSN a requirement for those on PC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later scrapped this</a> because it went down horrendously. However, there has been one other snag that came with all this PSN nonsense: region locking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Despite being able to play Helldivers 2 without a PSN account, it was still unavailable in almost 180 countries, all of which you can't make a PSN account in (it's still possible to play the game with an account connected, which will likely have factored into the reasoning behind region locking the game). This has applied to Sony's other PC ports of their PlayStation published games, except now, as shared by deals wizard Wario64, it seems a handful of them are now (mostly) region lock free.

There are four total, including the aforementioned <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/?changeid=29555004">Helldivers 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219787/history/?changeid=29555142">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219797/history/?changeid=29555257">Spider-Man 2</a>. Worth keeping in mind that these are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">all games that had their PSN requirements lifted earlier this year</a>. From what I can tell there haven't been any changes made to other PlayStation games based on their logs on SteamDB, but I'm also not entirely sure which games were and weren't region locked, so your mileage may vary with their wider portfolio.
</p>
<p>
It's a good move forward at least! Certainly seems like PlayStation are just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting where their games can actually be bought. Now the big question is whether or not their next big game (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie">that isn't Marathon</a>) on PC will have a PSN requirement at all.

            <p>
There's still a few days to go until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is unleashed onto the world. Whether it's any good or not in its entirety, we probably won't know for a while yet given that online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of its ilk are always guaranteed to receive numerous patches to iron out some kinks. Our own Nic found a good bit to like about the game in his preview, ignoring the at the time rubbish guns, at the very least.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Whether those tweaks come or not, Remedy have guaranteed one thing: some big free updates with new things to do. Ain't that nice! In the 2025 roadmap, there were a couple of updates outlined for the remainder of the year. The first one, coming in the fall/ autumn, is called Codename "Outbreak". This one brings in a new jobsite, the Research Sector, alongside some new gameplay systems and enemies, and earnable rewards. There'll also be a new paid Classified Requisition, which comes with some armour, skins, and character voice packs - the playable stuff in the update will be completely free though.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The launch of FBC: Firebreak is just the beginning. Have a look at what the post-launch roadmap will look like.</p><p>All playable post launch content in the game is free.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak launches June 17. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBCFirebreak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FBCFirebreak</a> <a href="https://t.co/bZdliHaOil">pic.twitter.com/bZdliHaOil</a></p></div>— Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) <a href="https://twitter.com/remedygames/status/1932800170418139480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Then in the winter there's the Codename "Blackout" update. The jobsite for this one hasn't been named, but there'll be even more enemies and rewards, alongside some new equipment. You'll also be able to pick up another paid Classified Requisition.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's communications director shared in a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">separate post</a> that there are plans for more updates in 2026 too, but the teams wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing, for free, in 2026 for FBC: Firebreak." Lots to come it sounds like then!
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak is due out next week, June 17th.
