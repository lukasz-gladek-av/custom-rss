            <p>I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">reported burnout-inducing manager</a>, but I'm interested to see more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ken-levines-new-game-judas-looks-a-lot-like-bioshock-infinite-in-space">"Bioshock Infinite in space"</a>, we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's from a new <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine">GamesIndustry.biz</a> interview that also contains Levine's thoughts on generative AI (ambivalent) and whether today's triple-A budgets are healthy (no), plus some regurgitated rhapsodising about the power of choice and interactivity and the importance of players telling their own stories. The last part makes me feel like it's 2003 again and I'm writing my first reader review for Eurogamer dot net, transfixed by the idea that I might, some day, discover the Citizen Kane of Games. </p>
<p>I don't doubt Levine's sincerity, but comments like "there's no medium that's more user-involved than our medium" now make me powerfully grumpy. They make me want to write an editorial about how most of the vaunted choices games offer are boring busywork or hollow gestures that weigh down the quieter, more graceful acts of interpretation that characterise the experience of non-interactive artworks like, say, those stupid films and books, which don't even let you push buttons to make characters talk.</p>
<p>But I won't do that: you came here to read about Judas. The interview harbours a few more concrete details about the narrative design of the game, which Levine acknowledges is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-story-games">taking a fair long while</a>. One of the reasons it's taking a while is that he basically wants every notable NPC to be capable of harbouring very meticulous grudges.</p><p>"The approach we're taking with Judas is heavily based upon recognition of player action and response to player action," Levine told the site. "Even just characters' observing a long range of player action and commenting on it. 'Hey, you saw this and you did that and then you did this and that was interesting because that caused that' - we're doing that kinda stuff right now. </p>
<p>"And it's really just observing the players and then writing the types of lines that could react to various types of things. It's a huge amount of work because you have to think of all the things a player can do and then write in-character responses for different characters to those actions in a way that feels organic."</p>
<p>Levine is keen to avoid "random number generator" moments, with characters handing you quests out of the blue. As he reiterates: "once you start observing sequences of events - having characters observe 'You did this and then you did that and that caused this and I'm mad because it did that' - that's when it gets really interesting."</p>
<p>The result, Levine promises, will be a game that supports many more routes to certain outcomes. "There are beats and how you got there is going to be fairly different from one player to the next," he says. "And places you'll get to are very different from one player to the next."</p><p>It sounds like the Mayflower itself will be a more open-ended environment than Bioshock's Rapture or Infinite's Columbia. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, if you look at them from a development standpoint - and this may be a bit alienating to some readers - but they're basically a corridor," Levine concedes. "A very, very long corridor with a bunch of trigger points that make story elements happen. Judas is made very, very differently and that makes it much more hopefully reflective of players agency, but also much, much harder to make."</p>
<p>I like the idea of a version of Bioshock in which Rapture isn't a gauntlet run populated by raving thespians, but a persistent society with a memory. I wouldn't put it past Ghost Story to be setting us up for a fall, however - Bioshock's big twist is that many of your choices weren't choices at all. If you find that prospect exhausting, the good news is that Alice Bee (RPS in peace) has already skipped forward a decade to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pre-emptive-backlash-to-backlash-to-positive-reviews-for-judas">review the negative reviews of the positive reviews of the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creepy-garfield-gorefield">Gorefield memes</a>. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds <em>nothing</em> like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.</p><!--more-->

<p>You can help the dashing Starbuckle by moving your mouse around and clicking the buttons while the screen scrolls rightwards. There’s a nifty recharging teleport attack which I seldom manage to aim effectively, despite this being a game so straightforward your actual housecat could probably finish it in one sitting. Be sure to time your collection of power-ups, as well: they’re on shuffle, and there’s nothing worse than bagging a surplus health refill when you badly need some ricocheting spaghetti beams.</p><p>Garfield nostalgia aside, this is quite a posh fan production, with art and sound effects from Lumpy, programming from qkjosh, music from MelonadeM with contributions from stevedoesmusic, and a 3D starfighter model from willkmr. The visuals are Lovecraftian purple and the soundtrack is that particular grade of chiptune that prompts mild synaesthesia and has me imagining the smell of Red Bull.</p>

<p>I do like it when developers throw their heart and soul into the production values of a video game concept spun out from a 6/10 title pun. Not that one should crack wise about Gorefield. He sees all. He is looking at the top of your head right now. He thinks the top of your head looks rather like a plate of lasagna.</p>
<p>You can play Gar-field <a href="https://lumpytouch.itch.io/gar-type">right here in a browser</a>. If the above has you salivating after more Gar-horror, I urgently recommend you read Nate’s (RPS in peace) review of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/garfield-kart-furious-racing-review">Garfield Kart Furious Racing</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
