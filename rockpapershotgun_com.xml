            <p>
It's coming up to a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> received its 1.0 release, and ahead of that anniversary developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/stunlock-studios">Stunlock Studios</a> shared a trailer earlier this week for the game's first big update, Invaders of Oakveil. The update itself will be free (nice!), and introduces a whole new area to explore, the titular Oakveil Woodlands, a woodsy area where "corruption" is spreading (not nice).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The big baddie of this update is Megara the Serpent Queen, presumably the source of said corruption. She's got some minions called The Venomblades, which sounds like a great name for a goth rollerblading group. In terms of gameplay additions, there's a new arena-building feature to be found in your castle, alongside one-on-one duels that can be found out in the wild that are consequence free. Oh, there's three new weapon types to mess around with, claws, twinblades, and throwing daggers, as well as seven new spells to boot.
</p>

<p>
Combat is also getting a big refresh, with stats seeing a rework, gear receiving some balance changes, and the addition of "new customization tools." Blood types have been reworked too, passive spells are apparently "more impactful", and unlocking spell points gives you some passive bonuses too. Lots of changes!
</p>
<p>
Crafting will be a bit easier too now as you can take ingredients from your vault without having to actually go to your vault to get them. Horse girls will delight in the fact that there'll be stables to store your horses in as well, alongside the ability to fill your prisons with creatures to take blood from (that one's not so much for the horse girls).
</p>
<p>
Alongside a few other changes that you can read about on the game's <a href="https://playvrising.com/oakveil">official website</a>, there's also the fact that V Rising will also be officially supported on Steam Deck. All of this is coming April 28th, so you've only got a couple of weeks to wait.

You can cancel your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> pre-order, you can hold off on picking up a Switch 2 for that inevitable The Duskbloods release, because there's a pretty good reason to return to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Earlier this week, modder extraordinaire Yui released the Dark Souls Remastered seamless co-op mod, which, if you can believe it, allows you to play through the game in online co-op with minimal interruptions.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yui shared a look at the mod in action in a video on her YouTube channel, and it certainly looks like it's doing what it says on the tin. One thing she did note is that this is an "early release" of the mod, meaning there might be a few bugs along the way, though there shouldn't be too many, and asked to let her know if you do encounter any.

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/557559/dark-souls-remastered-seamless-co-op-mod">Polygon</a> she also explained that this one was apparently easier to make than her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">Elden Ring co-op mod</a>, though there was a particular challenge in how old Dark Souls is. One big thing Yui had to work hard on was making it so that parts of the game wouldn't unload if someone got too far away from the host. In any case, the mod is apparently in good working order, so it still seems like the best way to play if you aren't a fan of how Souls games' co-op generally works.
</p>
<p>
It's a cool mod because you can play with up to five other people too, and progression will save in your copy of the game even if you're not the host. Unlike the base game, regular enemies scale in strength depending on how many people you're playing with, so there'll be a bit more of a challenge too.
</p>
<p>
Definitely seems like a good way to kill some time ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-knocks-back-an-estus-and-takes-a-swing-at-may-2025">Elden Ring Nightreign's release next month</a>.

Almost two years after it was first revealed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> have released a first-look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot's gameplay. And you know what? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's looking really good! And it's out September 23rd! Much like the reveal trailer it's incredibly stylish, there's this clean, almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> like quality to its world, but we've had hints of that already. The big thing is the gameplay, which looks like more of that chunky, Bungie, first-person shooting goodness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In terms of how matches work, you can form teams of up to three people as you head out to collect loot. Dying normally means losing any loot you've collected, but if you manage to get out successfully you can hang on to it for future runs. Matches can have up to 18 players, though it sounds like there won't necessarily be that many all the time, as you can even go solo if you like.

At launch there'll be six runners to choose from, but Marathon won't just be about the gameplay, as there'll be seasonal storytelling events too. Also, no idea why, but all of these details were delivered to us from Final Fantasy 16's own Ben Starr. Can't complain though, great voice!
</p>
<p>
The thing you'll probably most be interested in, though, is that the game is getting a closed alpha. This kicks off April 23rd and runs until May 4th, but there's a catch: it's for North America only. Perhaps a bit annoying for the rest of us, but I've never known gamers to be anything but a patient bunch. You'll have to join the game's official Discord to sign-up.
</p>
<p>
I'm really not much of a shooter person, they've never clicked with me honestly, but boy howdy does Marathon's sci-fi world look like it might change things for me. One concern I do have is that Bungie are obviously known for vaulting a large portion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s story - so much so it <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis">had to use fan made videos in a court case</a> to show off the game's story - that I can't help but wonder how they'll handle Marathon. I guess we'll find out in due time!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, you can watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlC31D_Rr-Y?si=GeF-7H49-3lRQSGk">highlight reel</a> of a bunch of YouTubers and Twitch streamers playing the game to get more of a feel of moment to moment gameplay. Just watch out for that Geoff Keighley jumpscare.
