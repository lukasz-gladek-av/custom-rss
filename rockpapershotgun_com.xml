            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the announcement</a> earlier this week that Riot-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled, a former Hypixel Studios dev has claimed that internal friction and "mismanagement" at the studio are to blame.</p>
<p>Hytale had been in development for a decade when Hypixel co-founder Noxy revealed that it'd been canned in a website post on June 23, also revealing that the studio will be closing in a few months' time. The game's release had been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a> a number of times since 2020.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following that news, former security and IT lead at Hypixel DevSlashNull has claimed in a tweet (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-issues-were-all-internal-former-hytale-dev-says-the-minecraft-inspired-survival-rpgs-cancelation-has-nothing-to-do-with-riot-the-community-should-be-angry-at-the-mismanagement/">GamesRadar</a>) that internal "mismanagement" at the studio, specifically friction among its leadership, was to blame Hytale's fate.</p>
<p>"Hytale: what could possibly go wrong when you hire new leadership that thinks the original team is incompetent?" he wrote. "Oh the whole project ends up going in circles until it dies. The community should be angry at the mismanagement that stole the opportunity for Hytale to flourish."</p>
<p>DevSlashNull went on to paint a positive picture of publisher Riot, adding that they were "an absolute pleasure to work with, from people to leaders" and "understood the power of empowering and giving folks agency", while making clear that in his estimation "the issues were all internal to Hytale's leadership".</p> <div>

<p>We've reached out to Hypixel Studios and Riot for comment.</p>
<p>While it didn't trace the problems back to studio leadership, Noxy's post announcing the cancellation did acknowledge that the game was deep in a cycle of feature creep by the time Riot opted to pull funding.</p>
<p>Asked by a fan whether the team ever had a version of Hytale running prior to the game's 2022 engine overhaul that "would have satisfied players if it would have been released", DevSlashNull responded: "I think so, some of the best moments for me in the team was us playtesting and running pvp tournaments internally on that engine. It was fun and had tons of potential."</p>
<p>Even if there's still a prototype worth building on here, however, the dev doesn't think the game or the work that went into it have much chance of being resurrected by Riot, as "the team that had the original vision and values had all left or been let go yesterday".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-hytale-dev-claims-internal-mismanagement-at-hypixel-stole-the-opportunity-for-hytale-to-flourish]]></content:encoded>
