You know, I don't think I'll ever understand why, after finding a huge amount of surprise success, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> decided to stop working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> all so that they could make a sequel. Perhaps that's just part of my general confusion towards live service games as a whole, but I do think it's a bit odd all the same. Still, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is still on track for a 2025 release it seems, with a date now set for the game's first open beta.
</p>

<p>
As confirmed in a very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be getting an open beta next month, May 22nd. In terms of content, there will apparently be 25 plus weapons, including the "brand new Borealis, an energy carbine power weapon", 10 plus modes like Takedown, a mode returning from the first game where "teams battle to eliminate all members of the opposing team before they can respawn", and 15 plus maps, including a couple of 24-player Onslaught maps.

Actually, hang on, scratch that, as both the trailer and a press release notes that there'll be "infinite" maps. The trailer didn't elaborate on that, and the press release said that 1047 "promise to reveal exactly what that means soon." Judging from the trailer itself, and the fact this was a feature in the first game, it'll be a map editor. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, that would still mean a finite amount of maps, as just because there would theoretically be a regular supply of them, you could still put an exact number as to how many there are. Perhaps there's some kind of randomly generated map feature instead, I don't know, I realise I'm being very particular about this, I just don't appreciate hyperbole. No details on how to sign-up just yet either, so you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled.

            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> was announced… sorry, hang on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">almost four years ago</a>? Cripes, time really does fly when you're waiting on the incredibly anticipated follow-up to one of the most popular games of all time doesn't it! It's no secret that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is happy to take his time with his next game, and good on him for doing so. However, he also can't help himself but continue to work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, releasing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">pretty big update</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">farming game</a> only last year. The good news is that, based on some comments in a recent interview, Haunted Chocolatier is the main focus going forward.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/">PC Gamer</a>, Barone explained,"The 1.6 update is pretty settled at this point. There were ongoing console ports and bug fixes, but it's pretty settled now. I'm committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier… I think it's in a good place. I feel very solid about it. I think if anyone picks up Stardew Valley for the first time in 2025, I'm very proud of it, and I think they'll have fun with it if they like this kind of game."
</p>
<p>
Another issue he's facing is his own work, specifically the work he did when he started development all those years ago. "It's been a few years that I've been working on it now and it's like, I look at some of the stuff I did at the beginning and I'm like, 'Oh man, here we go again. I'm gonna have to redo all of this," Barone said. Though, he did note it's not a case of anything being bad, just that given the passage of time he's a "different person" and his "aesthetic sensibilities have evolved."
</p>
<p>
That's one of the fatal flaws of game dev these days I think. How on earth can you properly reflect the artist you are now when it's a project you've been working on for years? A question I'm curious to see answered whenever Haunted Chocolatier does come out. Which, I imagine, is still probably a good while away.
