            <p>
I think there is a very compelling case for Twitter not being the place that information about, well, honestly anything, should be casually shared in a matter of fact manner. It is a site for, if we must use it, posting things like "just downloaded some MP3s to my iPod Touch," not sharing that Arrowhead are currently testing a roguelite mode in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, which is exactly what the game's creative director Johan Pilestedt did today.
</p>
<p>
He said it as simply as that too. In response to someone suggesting to him that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> mode might be fun, Pilestedt simply, and politely, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998824312401187274">responded</a>, "Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode - it changes the game fundamentally!" You cannot do this, Pilestedt, because now you'll have folks badgering you for only the gods know how long until such a mode is formally announced and/or available.
</p>
<p>
There are zero (less than one, more than minus one) other details to be found about such a prototype as Pilestedt has not shared them, and I imagine will not until there is something solid to be shared. This is a live service game after all, concepts and features change all the time, who knows if this one will even make it out the door?
</p>
<p>
It's also worth remembering that this is a live service game that has been struggling under its own weight recently. Back in October it received a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-huge-into-the-unjust-410-update-fires-out-over-200-bug-fixes-plus-some-weapon-balancing">massive update</a> that fixed more than 200 bugs (not that kind), an update that came after months of performance issues. These problems had been so prolific that they had to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">stop adding new bits like content and feature updates for a while</a>, the thing that keeps the money wheel turning. So, yeah, if that roguelite mode ever comes it, expect it to take a while.
</p><p>
Things seem to be in shipper shape these days, and it was just last week that Arrowhead released a build of the game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">cut its file size down to 23GB from 154GB</a>, exactly the kind of news my hard drive likes to see.

With trends and trendy games passing by these days, I'd understand if you'd already forgotten about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a>. I am not here to remind you of its existence to talk about it, more so use it as genre context for Dogpile, a new game that is essentially the question "what if Suika Game actually had a bunch of dogs and was also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder?" I know, I know, there are too many of those already, but this one's just so charming!
</p>
<p>
First of all, the entire thing is hand-drawn and animated. I feel like the best way I can describe the vibes of the aesthetic is that it looks like one of those fancy greetings cards in a boutique shop that costs more money than you're comfortable with, but it's for your aunt who you quite like and want to get a good chuckle out of her.

Instead of matching different types of fruit, here you must fuse various breeds of dogs together to create larger, equally funny looking dogs. They don't just come in circles either, there's all sorts of shapes adding one layer of tactical gameplay. You choose particular dogs to play from the cards you draw from your deck, but to mix things up all of these canines can have different positive and negative modifiers.
</p><p>
For example, there's a friendly modifier that essentially magnetises two matching dogs towards one another. On the other end, there's a crated modifier that means those dogs can't merge at all for a couple of rounds. Dogtags allow you to add in even more ways to mix up rounds, like one that turns every dog that's smaller than a pug into a pug.
</p>
<p>
To be honest I find Suika Game quite displeasing to look at, and ultimately there's only so much it can do. Dogpile, despite being yet another roguelike deckbuilder, looks like it might satisfy that itch I have for something more. And it's out right now! Today! At 30% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3839300/Dogpile/">Steam</a>! What more can you ask for?
