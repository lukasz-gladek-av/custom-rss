At a time where there is constantly word of this or that game shutting down, even successful ones, it will never fail to surprise me that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a> is still going. You can't play it on PS2 anymore, but there's still an active community on PC even now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> just celebrated its 23rd anniversary yesterday in fact, with a new update video and <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22548/detail.html">letter from the producer</a> Yoji Fujito released to highlight some of the new and upcoming features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, in a future update more monsters are getting added to Limbus. There's also a new morale gauge system coming to Besieged that gives your forces a stat boost. Perhaps most interesting of all is a feature you might take for granted in modern MMOs, which is the introduction of the character race change service. Dodgy name aside, this will allow you to change your character's race, gender, face type, hair colour, and size.

<p>
Updates over the last year even added in something as small as gamepad configuration adjustments, and as big as a new master trial, Wing of War.
</p>
<p>
Fujito's letter further explained that even now, the team is looking to help new and returning players, particularly solo ones, have an easier time with the game. Currently there's something called the alter ego system, which is similar to Final Fantasy 14's trust system in that you can recruit NPCs to help you on quests. According to Fujito, the devs will be looking to allow you to upgrade these alter egos "as a means of enhancing the solo player experience." They have other plans to smooth things over too, which is honestly a little wild to me for a game that's been running for so long.
</p>
<p>
I've not dived into Final Fantasy 11 myself, there's always too many games for me to play to even consider touching an MMO. Still, it's comforting in a strange way that knowing that it's there, trudging along, ready for myself or anyone else to give it a go. Kudos to the team!

Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">leaked</a> and then later confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">Stellar Blade</a>, that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque one with the jiggle physics cranked up to the max, would be coming to PC next month on June 11th. This was obviously welcome news to the kind of people who enjoy that sort of thing (more or less no judgement here). But it quickly became apparent that there was a bit of a caveat: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game isn't available to pre-order in all regions on Steam.
</p>

<p>
Now, you'll probably remember how a lot of Sony published games on Steam aren't available in every territory because of their annoying PSN requirement. That was at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped by Sony somewhat earlier this year</a>, so it's a bit confusing why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> isn't available in all regions. In fact, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> don't even seem to know why this is the case, as in a Dwitter post they explained that they are "closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our best to resolve most of it as soon as possible."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">üî∏Ô∏èWe are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.<br>üî∏Ô∏èAs shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/JDimvKiKte">pic.twitter.com/JDimvKiKte</a></p>‚Äî StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
They also clarified that connecting a PSN account is "entirely optional and never required." It's clear they know how badly this has been received across the board by PC players, and it sounds like this has been a bit out of their hands.
</p>
<p>
Outside of trying to get this region lock problem sorted, Shift Up also sought to make it known that the "DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases", and the mods will be "fully supported without any restrictions." I'm sure people plan on making perfectly regular mods for this game. Definitely not having a vision of something weird and questionable, no sir.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> aren't having a very good week are they? First there were those accusations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> using assets without permission from the artist 4ant1r34l (Antireal), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">which Bungie admitted to taking place</a>. Then yesterday there was a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2460495264">livestream</a> featuring game director Joe Ziegler and art director Joseph Cross which was filled with chat messages about said asset usage for practically the entire stream. Ziegler and Cross did at least address those messages, but with the response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> already being quite mixed thus far, it doesn't amount to much right now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Things also don't sound great internally at Bungie right now either. Several current and former employees reportedly spoke with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> about where Bungie and Marathon are at right now, with morale apparently in "free-fall" across all departments. One source supposedly said "the vibes have never been worse", and staff are concerned about what happens if Marathon flops, something the studio can't afford. There's been nothing said about a potential delay from the current September release date, and it's unclear at a lower level if those discussions are being had by higher-ups.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the art theft in particular, the explanation that's been provided publicly - that these assets were from a texture sheet made by a former Bungie artist - is the internal explanation as well.
</p>
<p>
Bungie's marketing plans sound like they're out the window too. A new trailer was meant to be coming in June, as well as the start of pre-orders, but this is apparently being reworked. A public beta meant to be held in August could now be turned into a "roadmap of public playtests" as well.
</p>
<p>
Those that spoke with Forbes also said that Marathon was pitched by higher-up "good old boy" Bungie leadership, and as long as five years ago team members were trying to explain what would and wouldn't work. They were frequently ignored. Apparently many devs even noted there should be some kind of PvE element to the game, a frequent complaint you will likely have seen about the game by now.
</p>
<p>
Bungie are in a very precarious position right now. They have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">lots of Destiny 2 updates and expansions on the way</a>, but there's no guarantees that'll bring people back the way it needs to. Who knows if there's even time to fix these big issues Marathon is facing. We'll just have to wait and see for now.
