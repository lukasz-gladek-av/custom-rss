I love a game that features some kind of cooking element, so I was quite pleased yesterday when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> revealed they're publishing Town Of Zoz, a new action RPG that's all about fighting off rats from eating your crops, taking down baddies to gather up ingredients, and using said ingredients and crops to make some tasty meals. It's got wonderfully vibrant art and animation. The announcement trailer quickly won me over with the choppy, almost stop-motion-like quality of certain character models.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Town Of Zoz is the debut title from Studio Pixanoh, following Ito, a "young shaman chef adventurer" who has to come home to help run his family's farm and restaurant. There's the usual RPG questiness - dark secrets amongst the locals that you have to uncover, you know the drill - but what really sells me is its Breath Of The Wildy cooking format. Kill an enemy and out comes something like an avocado or chicken legs. Once you've got enough ingredients, you head to the kitchen, where it looks like you'll have to fend off more enemies while your food cooks.

<p>
It looks like a fun, satisfying loop, and the cherry on top is what you do with the food afterwards. As you get to know people around town, you might learn their favourite meal. Making it for them will bring you closer together, and let you learn more about them. Obviously this is just a trailer, but so far Town of Zoz really seems to understand that food is best when it's a communal activity, something to share and bond over. As someone whose family used to run a restaurant themselves, this one's really speaking to me.
</p>
<p>
And if I wasn't sold enough by this game already, some of the score is coming from 2 Mello. His <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> inspired album Memoirs Of Tokyo-To is a banger, and he's done excellent work for games like If Found, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/later-alligator">Later Alligator</a> too. I'll take that release date now please! You can, like I already have, wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>While never officially announced by Bethesda, rumours of an Unreal Engine 5 remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> have been circling the proverbial dialogue pie since 2023, surfacing first via an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/oblivion-linked-virtuos-is-making-an-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-remake/">alleged developer</a>, then leaked court documents. Edwin wrote about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">potential improvements to combat here</a>, while noting that the same leaked documents also mentioned both a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. This might well either prime you with a healthy dose of scepticism, or else have you running around the house shouting "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3!" at your pets, as I do at least once a week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "noted insider" NatetheHate reckons this Oblivion remake is getting revealed "in the coming weeks' - a claim they say they've corroborated. "Nate claims the game will likely release before June, while sources have told VGC it could arrive as soon as next month".</p>

<p>It's reportedly being developed by support n' port studio Virtuous - who've worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Uncharted, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Delta</a> - and "fully remade" in UE5, with reworks to stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reactions, and the HUD.</p>
<p>The armoured elephant in the room here is, of course, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - the full fan remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">still on track for a 2025 release date</a>. It's been in development since 2012, and the team pegged this year for likely release back in 2023. I'm being genuine when I say that the official Oblivion remaster rumours manifesting that year is likely a coincidence - the Skyblivion team have been in dialogue with Bethesda throughout development, so I doubt there's any real tension there.</p>
<p>I do, however, feel that Bethesda could possibly show a bit more respect to their modding community here by not swooping in to steal Skyblivion's thunder, even if I understand the business rational behind not wanting to miss out on potential sales from players that already have a perfectly good modern Oblivion, thank you very much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I couldn't tell you why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has left Star Fox to rot with the likes of Kid Icarus, while other series like Advance Wars have made a comeback (no shade to Advance Wars fans), but it has. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/chuhai-labs">Chuhai Labs</a> are here to save the day with Wild Blue, an upcoming on-rails shooter just revealed yesterday at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/humble-games">Humble Games</a> Showcase. The teaser itself didn't show a lick of gameplay, but it's worth noting that Chuhai Labs were founded by Giles Goddard, one of the programmers for the original Star Fox on SNES.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Goddard boisterously introduced himself in Wild Blue's teaser trailer as the "only person that worked on S**r F*x". The redactions are courtesy of the trailer itself - don't worry, I've not somehow convinced myself that the name of a classic Nintendo game is a curse word or anything.

<p>
There's another tongue in cheek moment with a character that definitely isn't Peppy Hare reciting the infamous "do a barrel roll" line, before being cut off by someone else - presumably protagonist Bowie Stray (excellent name) - saying "we don't call them that here". So this really is just legally distinct Star Fox.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/">Steam page</a> doesn't share all that much either, there's an indication of the kind of locales you'll by flying over like deserts, oceans, that kind of thing, and that there'll be branching paths you can take, but for the most part this is very much an "our game exists" kind of announcement. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that, especially seeing as Nintendo haven't given any kind of indication they're working on a new Star Fox. The last official entry was from way back in 2016, so I'm happy for all of you retroheads that will be able to get your "anthropomorphic animal cool spaceships fix" with Wild Blue, whenever it comes out.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will in fact be compatible with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Ubisoft say, despite a previous <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">tech Q&amp;A</a> on the sneaky-stabby ninja sim declaring point-blank that it won’t. Announced on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687">whatever the fuck Twitter is</a> these days, the confirmation that Shadows will play nice with the Deck comes as a pleasant surprise – even without that prior naysaying, games with a GTX 1070 listed among the minimum specs typically don’t cope too well on the handheld’s frugal hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The only question, suggesteth the tweet, is whether Shadows will get a full-on Verified stamp of approval from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Valve’s compatibility testers</a>, or the Playable classification, which is normally handed to games that run well enough but might have awkward controls or tricky-to-read text. It’ll help, at least, that this particular Assassin’s Creed is launching with a native Steam version, and won’t solely be yoked to Ubisoft Connect (though there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">other ways</a> of installing that launcher on your Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Another barrier that Ubisoft have seemingly both erected and cleared is Shadows’ mandatory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">ray tracing</a>. While not slathered in always-on megalighting like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, it won’t be possible to entirely switch off ray traced effects, as they’ll always be enabled in the player’s hideout hub at minimum. With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-eternals-ray-tracing-now-works-on-the-steam-deck">few exceptions</a>, ray tracing will cut down Steam Deck performance like an impertinent daimyo’s neck, but Ubisoft have also created a more easygoing, software-based version of these effects, which will supposedly function adequately on lower-end GPUs. Which would explain why the GTX 1070 is in the minimum specs and not, say, the RTX 2060, with all its hardware-based ray tracing tools.</p>
<p>Whatever you might play it on, Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches next Thursday, April 20th. Ed (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-my-time-with-assassins-creed-shadows-but-i-remain-unconvinced-by-its-split-protagonists">had a play in January</a>, finding it a competent open-world yarn, though was less impressed with the dual-protagonist gimmick that left hulking samurai Yasuke feeling less fleshed-out than stealthy shinobi Naoe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
