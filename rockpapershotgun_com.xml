            <p>Workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">soon to be under new ownership</a> Electronic Arts are reportedly struggling with a push from management towards trying to use AI for "just about everything". That's according to a new report, which claims staff are concerned about the likes of code mistakes they'll then have to clean up and the tech being trained to replace them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> asserts that the publishers have been pushing their around 15,000 employees to use AI for almost all of the daily tasks. According to anonymous staff, that includes having managers use it to script chats with colleagues about sensitive topics like pay and promotions. You know, the sort of thing that definitely requires and is improved by spending time asking a bot to do words.</p>
<p>The report cites prompts advising managers about "how to talk to a direct report whose performance is negatively affecting business results but who believes otherwise" and "how to phrase constructive questions when a sought-after promotion is denied" as examples.</p>
<p>Staff are also reportedly being made to train the tech to do bits of their jobs, naturally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-boss-boasts-of-being-able-to-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-but-says-itll-never-replace-the-human-aspect">fuelling fears</a> that doing so will be a factor in whether staff in certain roles will be among the next round of layoffs. A former senior QA worker at Respawn told Business Insider that he believes AI being used to review and summarise feedback from play testers contriubuted to him ending up among 100 people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">laid off by EA this spring</a>.</p>
<p>AI tools such as a chatbot dubbed ReefGPT are also reportedly being used to produce code, leading staff to have to go back and fix flaws or errors in what the machine spits out.</p>
<p>EA declined to respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but did discuss their approach to AI in a US financial filing earlier this year. "The use of artificial intelligence might present social and ethical issues that, if not managed appropriately, may result in legal and reputational harm, cause consumers to lose confidence in our business and brands and negatively impact our financial and operating results," they wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI is "not merely a buzzword for us", but "the very core of our business" in a speech to investors last year. That sort of setting is the kind of place you'd expect to hear the Generative AI dream being pushed most heavy-handedly, something arguably borne out by the fact Wilson's comment looked to lump it in with playing a FIFA match against a computer-controlled opponent the devs have programmed.</p>
