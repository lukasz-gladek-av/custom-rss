            <p>An Assassin's Creed designer who publicly spoke out against Ubisoft's return-to-office mandate claims the company have now fired him. Developer David Michaud-Cromp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">posted on LinkedIn last week</a> that he'd been put on unpaid disciplinary leave after recently criticising the policy change on the social media platform.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ubisoft have recently revealed plans to push remote staff back into offices amid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations, restructuring and voluntary redundancies</a>. The company intend to have employees return to working in-office five days a week, with an annual allowance of work-from-home days. All of these moves have understandably not gone down well with French unions, who've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">subsequently called strike action</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This brings us to Michaud-Cromp's latest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424133083051978757/">LinkedIn post</a>, in which the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> team lead wrote he'd been "terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately". "This was not my decision. I won’t be discussing internal details or circumstances. I’m taking time to regroup and will share next steps when appropriate," he added.</p>
<p>Asked about the firing, Ubisoft provided the following statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081">Kotaku</a> via a spokesperson: "Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal. We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity, and repetition of the breach."</p><p>Speaking to Kotaku, Michaud-Cromp offered more of his view on remote work, outlining that in his estimation nailing "fundamentals like clarity of goals, trust, documentation, tooling, and communication practices" often has more of an impact on the effectiveness of teams than how physically close their members are from 9 to 5.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's decision to force staff back into the office, potentially costing those who can't do so due to various personal circumstances their jobs, has been one of the main areas the unions organising strikes on behalf of Ubisoft staff they represent object to. A number of staff have <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot">reportedly</a> been left feeling as though they've suffered a "betrayal" at the hands of top management they can't trust. In that same article from Game Developer, two Ubisoft devs who serve as representatives for the Solidaires Informatique union - Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui - have publicly called for CEO Yves Guillemot to resign.</p>
<p>"I think Guillemot should move away at this point," Rutschlé said. "I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again."</p>

            <p>As any Civ player knows, time has a habit of passing. Next week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> will turn a year old. It's been a year of regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-nautically-themed-130-update-arrives-today-delivers-significant-buffs-to-popular-civs">additions</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-update-131-drops-today-rolling-out-a-new-island-filled-map-and-knocking-egypt-off-the-top-of-the-pyramid">tweaks</a> following the mixed initial reception to Firaxis' attempt to do something different with their grant strategy behemoth. Fitting, then, that the devs have rung in that first birthday by revealing when they're hoping to drop some big changes that'll have "major implications" for Civ 7.</p>

<p>As outlined in a video and <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/anniversary/">blog post</a> fronted by Civ creative director Ed Beach, these larger changes and additions will be arriving as part of a free update dubbed Test of Time, which Firaxis are "tentatively aiming" to drop this spring. Headlining its contents thus far is the return of the ability to play as one civilization throug the whole game if you wish, something the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">announced they were working on</a> last year.</p>
<p>Beach outlined how exactly it'll be implemented here, making clear it's not a separate game mode or a replacement for the base game's system of shifting civs with each age change. Instead, when you hit the end of an age, you'll simply be offered the option to keep on plugging with the same civ, with AI civs mirroring whether you choose to stick or twist in their own end of age decisions. To help ensure long-running civs don't get stale, Firaxis have opted to introduce a couple of new features - Apex Ages and Syncretism.</p><p>The first of those is a "sole Age where this civ gets its full, unique kit", designed to mirror the period when it was in its prime or fits best with the world. Beach provided Rome in the antiquity age as an example. "Civs played outside of their Apex Age retain a core, defining part of their kit and gain a new Age-appropriate Civic Tree," he added. "In our example, this tree includes a unique node, Roman Renaissance, that lets you optionally unlock more Age-appropriate Roman perks, as well as two nodes based on your civ's attributes – in Rome's case that's Cultural and Militaristic. These attribute-based nodes are common for all civs outside of their Apex Age, providing perks that are relevant for the current Age's mechanics."</p>
<p>Syncretism, meanwhile, gives you the option "to study a Mastery on your new unique Civic node, and adopt the Unique Units or Infrastructure from another civilization currently in its Apex Age". So, if you're playing an ancient civ and want to incorporate another civ's unique exploration age ships into your fleet to bolster your effectiveness at that point in time, you can do so.</p>
<p>Alongside the ability to play as one civ throughout, Firaxis are using the update to switch up how victories are earned with the hopes of offering more variety in winning strategies via Military, Economy, Culture, or Science, rather than pushing you into a single legacy path. Finally, legacy paths themselves have been replaced with new "Triumphs", which offer a wide range of optional, challenging objectives to complete as you go, allowing you to score points in the various winning metrics civs are measured by.</p>
<p>So, that's Tests of Time. Prior to the big update, Firaxis also have a smaller update dubbed 1.3.2 set to arrive soon. That one'll bring nested tooltips, more civ balancing tweaks, the ability to immediately see how useful a tile is, plus reworks of AI diplomacy and coastal raids. A free leader - Gilgamesh - will also be arriving for every player with 1.3.2 as a nice little anniversary present.</p>

            <p>I'm going to a toddler's birthday party on Saturday and I have it on good authority from Alva's dad that there will be trays of sandwiches and a couple of cakes from M&amp;S. There is no booze provided. I'm not sure if that's because there should be no booze consumed at a two-year-old's birthday, or only that we should bring our own. I guess I'll find out for sure if they frisk on the door. However, if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>'s latest anniversary update is anything to go by, I am now looking forward to Alva's fifth birthday.</p>
<p>To mark five years in Early Access, developer Iron Gate have released an anniversary patch that is a damn sight better than the prospect of watching a sad looking Colin the Caterpillar cake getting pawed at by hungry toddlers. There are flower garlands, mysterious axe heads, and a steady 60 fps on Steam Deck performance mode. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d6gBu2Zd7Bc">Who doesn't want mysterious blades at a birthday party?</a></p>
<!--more-->
<p>While it may not be a name you would put on a banner, <a href="https://www.valheim.com/news/five-years-of-valheim-/">patch 0.221.10</a> offers a little something to both the players who love the idea of a party and those who would rather stay home.</p>
<p>For the partiers, there are Fey Lights to string up around your settlement, sweetbreads to bake and serve, and flower garlands to wear as you use the new Vibe and LoveYou emotes. If you want to keep things lowkey, you may just want to wear the celebratory cap.</p><p>On the midpoint of the partier to non-partier, you will find a pair of new materials – the mysterious axe head and the curious axehead. You'll need both if you want to craft Early Axes, a new dual-wielded axe you can attain much earlier than the Berserkir Axes.</p>
<p>Then on the non-partier end of the scale you will find a stack of quality of life changes. Engine optimisations to improve performance, fixes to reduce armour stands' exorbitant CPU usage, a less memory intensive minimap.</p>
<p>All those performance improvements have had a knock on effect for the Steam Deck's performance mode, which now sees Valheim reaching the all-important 60 fps.</p>
<p>What I really appreciate about this patch is not the improvements it's making the Early Access Viking simulation, but the gift ideas that it's given me for Alva's fifth birthday party. A nice cap and a pair of axe heads are easy enough to come by. And it saves me trying to work out which Famous Five books she's already read.</p>

            <p>After being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-accused-of-using-ai-generated-art-to-promote-sale-as-job-listing-indicates-theyre-keen-to-adopt-ai-assisted-development-tools">accused last week</a> of using AI-generated artwork to promote their store's new year sale, retro game sellers GOG have reportedly addressed the issue in a private Discord server for paying supporters. According to this fresh response from a GOG staffer, the banner was made "with the help of Al tools" and was "mistakenly allowed" to be pushed live on the storefront.</p>

<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-ai-art-banner-ad-confirms-discord-message-small-team-slop-2000665056">Kotaku</a> report having been sent a screenshot of this response posted in a message to GOG's official Patron Discord server by an employee with the handle Arthur Slay. Beginning with Slay making clear that they're addressing the New Year Sale banner, their message as shared by Kotaku continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>First of all, regarding the quality of the asset: This banner was a work-in-progress asset that we mistakenly allowed to be displayed on the storefront. This shouldn’t have happened. We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error. Second, I want to confirm that this WIP asset was indeed made with the help of Al tools. We hear your disappointment with the use of this technology, and see that it’s a sensitive topic for many of you.</blockquote>
<p>Slay then reportedly went on to discuss GOG's general approach to the use of AI, emphasising that the game sellers "don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants" and that they "experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have" as part of their preservation efforts. "We’ve been testing different technologies since our beginnings," the staffer added. "Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not. Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less."</p><p>Approached for comment on the sale banner last week, GOG told RPS they were unable to "comment publicly on our internal processes or tools". I've reached out to the company for a second time in light of this Discord message.</p>
<p>The Polish storefront - noted for revamping and selling a bunch of classic games - changed ownership in late 2025, with Witcher developers CD Projekt opting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">sell to original GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński</a> in a deal worth about £18.6 million. So far, Kiciński's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">suggested the plan for the store going forwards</a> is to remain focused on preservation and DRM-less games.</p>
