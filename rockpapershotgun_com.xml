            <p>Right, so. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, the official Oblivion remaster which released earlier this year. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the fan-made Oblivion remake mod which still currently looks due out relatively soonish, despite its release window having been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">source of drama a few months ago</a>. There's also <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, another massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim modding</a> project, but this time seeking to re-create the province in which Oblivion's set as it might be at the time The Elder Scrolls five takes place. Simple. The last one of those has just released a fresh teaser.</p>

<p>Despite having already released one of its regions as a very well-received and popular forerunner - that'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> - the same team's full version of Cyrodiil doesn't look as far along in the development process as Skyblivion. That said, is devs have still been sharing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ar__IhI5cs">regular progress updates</a> over the past couple of years. Their latest is a teaser of the mod's questline surrounding Anvil, with getting the gold coast city up and running having been a key focus of their work this year.</p>
<p>What's afoot in the picturesque southern port town? Well, two important-sounding dudes are having a chat about birds in front of Anvil's count. One of them is called Ramon and the other's Anvil's viscount. The former's concerned about a mysterious idealist/criminal dubbed The Wren, who's threatening to throw a spanner into the works of the trade which keeps Anvil running. There's also some courtly bickering going on about succession, with debate over whether a lad named Corvinus, seemingly the viscount's son, is fit to rule the city and deal with its fowl predicament.</p><p>As that chat plays out, the modders show off a bunch of shots in and around their version of Anvil. It looks lovely, if suffering from the unavoidable limitation of looking more like Skyrim in a new hat than a game built from scratch would. The Discord post accompanying the teaser also offers an intro to one of the side quests Anvil'll offer. It's about you becoming an entrepreneurial child's minion.</p>
<p>"The city of Anvil is home to many up-and-coming business dealers, though some fall further outside the norms than others," the modders' blurb for this quest reads. "Meet the future saltwater business owner; Jinol! He has plans for creating a business run and owned by the children of Anvil and he is looking for any would-be business partners passing through Anvil to help him in this innovative endeavour." God, imagine what the Elder Scrolls equivalent of those terrible CEO grind-themed podcasts would be.</p>
<p>The Beyond Skyrim lot plan to show off more during an Anvil stream set to take place on their YouTube channel on December 6th, and they're keen to recruit folks for the following roles: "Animators, writers, editors, navmeshers, concept artists, 3D artists, experienced exterior landscapers, dungeon designers, creation kit implementers, sound effects artists, and quality assurance".</p>
<p>By the looks of their last update, the areas which include Leyawiin, Bravil, Cheydinhal, and the Imperial City all have plenty of work that needs doing once Anvil's sorted. I'm intrigued by the idea of returning to Cyrodiil down the line for something that isn't trying to repackage TES IV and have really dug the time I've spent with their Bruma mod, so I'll be keeping an eye on the Beyond Skyrim folks' progress.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>’s legions of fan weather-watchers spotted <a href="https://streamable.com/r96864">a portfolio reel</a> created by former Rockstar animator Benjamin Chue that includes what appears to be some WIP stuff from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>. Assuming the leak is legitimate, this isn’t nearly an eruption on the scale of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gta-6-leaks-benefit-precisely-no-one">the 2022 GTA 6 leaks</a>: it contains a couple of extremely non-final animations from the forthcoming open world game. 
</p>
<p>One is of deuteragonist Lucia Caminos jumping out of a pick-up truck, which seems like a thing she’d do, though official GTA 6 trailers suggest she’d do it with a lot more bum jiggle than this. Another is of a placeholder baldy man – let’s christen him something appropriately generic, like Jean-Luc Picard – undocking a bike from a public bicycle hire station. Yes, GTA 6 has Boris Bikes.
</p><!--more-->
<p>I call them Boris Bikes because that’s what they were nicknamed when they came to London a few years ago, during the mayorship of tactically “bumbling” clown-emperor Boris Johnson. Since then, they’ve switched sponsors and been rebranded as Barclays Bikes and Santander Cycles, neither of which has the same ring, nor the same mild notoriety. In GTA 6, the bike hire scheme appears to be named LomBikes, a division of LomBank, a bank that <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lombank">already exists</a> in the world of GTA. That’s what it’s called in the animation reel. You can also make out a LomBike docking station in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kvaqks/looks_like_gta_vi_will_have_rental_bikes_like/">one of the leaked 2022 images</a>, which Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-confirm-gta-6-leaks-but-say-it-wont-have-any-long-term-effect-on-development">have confirmed as genuine</a>. 
</p>
<p>The presence of public bike hire stations in GTA 6 gives me a weird pang. It might be the only thing that has given me a weird pang, to be honest, save for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">the Tom Petty music in the announcement trailer</a>. I used to live in a block near central London and the local kids were always doing experiments on the bikes. There was always a jailbroken Boris inside the security door that was covered in unidentifiable substances. The vehicle would deteriorate further as the weeks went by, eventually migrating to its final resting place beneath a stairwell. When riding the Boris Bikes, there was the thrill of trying to reach a docking station with a vacant slot inside the free usage period. At least one of these anecdotes feels like a natural basis for a GTA sidequest.
</p>
<p>GTA 6 has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">delayed again</a> – it’ll now launch in November 2026. In the meantime, Rockstar face a lawsuit from a UK union after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">firing around 30 people on charges of leaking confidential information</a>.</p>

            <p>November is...done! The tawdry moveable feast that is Videogaming shudders and rolls beyond the canopy, out into the whitening dunes and fathoms of December. Now for revelry! Strike your trumpets! Blow your drums! Possibly the other way round! The folk of game development exit their wagons and sprint weeping amongst the dissipating trees. A bunch of narrative and game designers put on eight-inch stilettos and form a high-kicking cabaret line. The stilettos fly off and perforate Take-Two's entire executive board. A miracle! Saint CJ be praised! 
</p>
<p>What wonders await us out here in the climactic month of the year? More PC games, apparently. Here are a few that deserve scrutiny, maybe even celebration.
</p>
<h2>Monday 1st December</h2>
<ul>
<li>People keep yelling at me in comments that Dotemu's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> (pictured) is an awesome throwback beat 'em up and we are perfect dunces for ignoring it. Fine, those people. Here's an Official RPS Mention. Now get the hell out of my office.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467850/Wild_Growth/">Wild Growth</a> is an intriguing and snazzily pigmented incremental fantasy strategy game in which you play healer to a Norse warband. I like games that explore the healing profession. I'm not massively into idle clickers, though.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 2nd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tingus-goose">Tingus Goose</a> is that frightful game about goose trees that sprout babies. Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humans-birth-geese-who-birth-mutants-to-pay-for-elaborate-sky-mating-in-tingus-gooses-steam-next-fest-demo">inflicted this on us a few months ago</a>. The very title gives me hives. I'd successfully obliterated it from my memory, but then Julian went and recommended it over Slack this morning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleep-awake">Sleep Awake</a> is the horror game in which people vanish when they sleep, and everybody has accordingly gone nuts for want of shuteye/energy drinks. Wimps! </li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> is Santa Ragione's grotesque psychosexual farming fable inspired by Surrealist film and featuring human slaves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 3rd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2692990/DONT_SCREAM_TOGETHER/">Don't Scream Together</a> is not a polite reminder to only scream by yourself in the privacy of your own home, but a Blair Witchy co-op horror game with mandatory mic usage. Don't talk too loud or you'll become what's chasing you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 4th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3884520/Blood_Refreshed_Supply/">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is Nightdive's revamp of Monolith's 1997 Build engine shooter, featuring 42 levels of demonic mischief, a new scenario, and originally cut features such as weather.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> is a long-in-development sci-fi horror in which you explore a trashed Moonbase from the 1980s. One for the Alien: Isolation and Observation lovers.</li>
<li>Floating city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flotsam">Flotsam</a> leaves early access today. Sim Waterworld, they're calling it, despite the commendable absence of Kevin Costner.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveller 0</a> is a town-building prequel to Square Enix's "HD-2D" throwback RPG that includes stuff from the free-to-play Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 5th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3757210/Agreeee/">Agreeee</a> is about trying to agree to the terms and conditions so that you can play the dang game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also coming this week: some new DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, and Mechwarrior V. Plus: various embargoed things. We are entering the final Events season of the year. The silvery shoals and drifts of December hide many secrets. Like hungry sand fleas, they wriggle towards the footfalls of the game devs carousing on the forest's edge. Eesh! Anyway, let us know if there are any promising new games we're missing.

            <p>So, an ambitious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> multiplayer mod called CyberMP has been in development for a little while now, and the folks behind it have just concluded its "most stable and successful" closed beta test yet. Tweaks to key elements like vehicle and player synchronisation, as well as a new interface and custom lobbies went down well with testers, while technical gremlins were minimal.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about CyberMP, it's a project that's currently being worked on by a team of 10, having first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod-gains-traction-following-successful-playtest">come to prominence</a> last summer. Its goal is to offer multi-person deathmatches and races to Cyberpunkers, rather than full GTA Online-style co-op missioning or gigging.</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the mod's latest closed beta test, which the modders had <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1404067462986731571">previously teased</a> would be a "pivotal stage in the project's evolution". As shown off in the video above, the CyberMP team invited a group to give some races and shootouts a go, as well as cruise around Night City.</p><p>According to the modders' <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1444762474581590148">latest Discord post</a>, the key goals included making sure progress had been made on getting players and vehicles to sync up seamlessly, with the CyberMP folks having reworked both systems. Thankfully, that work's paid off, with characters and cars reportedly translating more smoothly across players' screens, while moving about on foot feels "more responsive".</p>
<p>Also under the microscope were a new interface overlay, which provides everything from chat functions to the ability to teleport around the world, and the option to create custom lobbies for the mod's races and battles. Finally, testing out a new JavaScript module and how CyberMP runs on Linux were on the to-do list. The modders say all went well, adding in terms of those last two technical bits: "several minor bugs that were found have already been fixed, and we will continue working on optimisation".</p>
<p>"In summary, we can confidently say this was the most stable and successful test in the project’s history," the CyberMP team wrote. "Over the few days, only a handful of game client crashes were recorded, some of which were not directly related to the CyberMP client. All discovered gameplay bugs have either already been fixed or are being fixed now. We feel we’re reaching a new level and are preparing for even more extensive changes."</p>
<p>As of writing, the mod's still without a release date, but its creators did tease here that more updates on on the way soon. So, I guess all we can do is keep out weird robo-eyes peeled for news of when multi-merc meetups might open up to everyone.</p>
