            <p>I cannot remember any of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>’s bosses, so it’s perhaps for the best that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach will let us skip right past them – skip right past them like children who think video games are just Instagram montages, and that the power of choice is a Christian rock band. Kojima Productions’ forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> off-Reeder will apparently give you the option to bypass bossfights after your defeat, with information about the character then fed to you in the form of image and text descriptions. In other words, Death Stranding 2 is secretly a hybrid visual novel.</p><!--more-->
<p>I jest, I jest! No visual novel would ever receive this kind of financing. They probably blew through the entire budget of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amarantus">Amarantus</a> on Troy Baker’s eyeshadow. Rest assured that Death Stranding 2 will have traditional real game accoutrements like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">shooting and cyberpunk pedalos</a>, but should you miss claiming a boss’s scalp by millimetres you will now have the option of delegating its defeat to the Game Over screen.</p>
<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," explains <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a> on Xitter, translating and summarising comments from game director Hideo Kojima during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-will-let-you-clear-bosses-without-actually-defeating-them">Eurogamer</a>. The bossfight and any story revelations therein will then be spelled out "like a novel".</p>
<p>What will the Kojima faithful make of all this? As Matt Jones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pillowfort.bsky.social/post/3lmrgnq4bec26">points out on Bluesky</a>, other developers have proposed to let players skip things and gotten it in the neck from people who regard ‘cheating’ at games as some kind of Nietzschean self-negation.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, for example, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat">received a torrent of abuse from disgruntled Dragon Age 2 players</a> over a recirculated interview from 2006, in which she argued that some games might benefit from the option to skip the combat. Something tells me that Kojima will be granted more latitude. Myself, I see no harm in letting Death Stranders skip bossfights as long as Death Stranding 2 doubles down on the hiking mechanics and lets me choose from a selection of bootlace knots to modify my stamina and agility. Also I want a pogo stick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Much coverage of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> has compared the Firaxis 4X to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s 2021 release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. As our dirty turncoat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> columnist Sin Vega briefly explores in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">her review for Eurogamer</a>, the game's Age structure, which hands you a new culture at intervals in each campaign, is reminiscent of Humankind's Era transitions.</p>
<p>Developers Firaxis have elsewhere observed that the impression of Civ cribbing notes from Humankind is an unfortunate coincidence. According to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/gaming/interview-civilization-7-almost-scrapped-its-iconic-settler-start-but-the-team-couldn-t-let-it-go/ar-AA1pwT01">an interview</a> with executive producer Dennis Shirk last year, the Civ 7 team came up with the concept on their own, pitching it to parent company 2K Games mere days after Amplitude unveiled Humankind. It's also, of course, worth reiterating that as a historical 4X, Humankind takes plenty of cues from older Civilizations. Still, Amplitude co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis was tickled pink when he saw Humankind cited in Civ 7 reviews. "That was probably the best compliment I ever got when I read some of these articles on Civ 7," he told me during an interview about Amplitude's forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, adding "I did not see that coming, to be frank."</p> <!--more-->
<p>While they're obviously competitors, and have never done any kind of formal collaboration, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude and Firaxis largely get on and are enthused by each other's work. "Sometimes we have conventions where we meet some programmers, some designers, we chat, and it's always cool, because it's always very good stuff," he told me, when I asked if the two teams had ever gotten together to bandy around features. "But we could see from a while ago that already they were following [our work]. And it was very exciting for us, being much smaller at the time, and still is today. I mean, Firaxis was, in many ways, the reason for me to become a designer, originally. So when these people look at my games, it's very surprising."</p>
<p>Being compared to Civilization can be tricky, of course, in terms of managing the expectations of players and publishers. The 4X is fundamentally a "niche" genre, de Waubert de Genlis argued, and few specimens beside Civ are capable of <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report">shifting millions before launch</a>. Amplitude's games tend to have a "small bump" at first, he said, gathering a healthy following over the coming months.</p>
<p>"Basically Civilization is like 16 or 17 million players on Civ 6, I think," he spelled out. "Then most of our 4Xs are around 2 million-ish, Humankind is at 3.5 million. So it's big, but still far away from the 17 million. And then if you look at the other 4Xs that are not Amplitude or not Civ, the best ones would be... I'd say it depends if you take Paradox as [the same kind of] 4X or not, because they're real time. If you take turn-based 4X, very quickly you go down to the very small numbers. So it is difficult."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude have never felt pressured to out-perform Civilization - even from Humankind publisher Sega, their parent company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sell-off-studio-behind-endless-legend-and-humankind-as-part-of-restructuring-but-it-goes-to-the-original-owners">until November last year</a>. "Sega were not really telling us, you know, we had to be Civilization because, you know, it's a 25 year franchise, or more, maybe 30 year franchise," he said. "And you can't overnight become Civilization."</p>
<p>Whether they originate from Civ or a smaller, feisty Civlike, I'm keen to see more Age or Era-style mechanics in strategy games. Back in 2021, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humankind-pc-review">called jumping Eras "possibly Humankind's greatest strength"</a>, allowing the player to switch rails and transform, say, a culture greased by gold into one fuelled by research. "This on-the-fly redefinition of your entire gameplan, and the fact that it's a necessity rather than an option, is a masterstroke," he wrote. "The more I play, the more fundamentally brilliant a mechanic I realise it is, and on this front at least, I don't feel like a dick in saying Humankind blows Civ out of the water."</p>
<p>I'm not sure Civ 7 players are as keen about the implementation of Ages. Here is another chunk from traitorous opportunist Sin's Eurogamer review: "The first two ages close with escalating crises that force you to choose negative modifiers (evil doppelgangers of social policies, which are unlocked with culture instead of science) until the act break. It's a move towards narrative - an unpredictable challenge to make the game - and you - less rote. In practice, they're either irrelevant or deeply irritating."</p>
<p>The broad thinking behind Eras and Ages is to keep breaking players out of their ruts over the course of a mammoth campaign. I think that's a noble aim, even if the execution is muddled. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is trying something similar with the tidefall mechanic, which peels back the ocean at intervals to reveal new navigable areas. You can read more about that in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2-is-everything-i-love-about-2014s-best-4x-but-on-a-map-thats-constantly-changing">Endless Legend 2 hands-on</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A modder for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> has pared back the fighting game to its bare essentials by removing most of its flashy new features, in an effort to "get us back to [Tekken 5] days." The mod is called "Good Ass Tekken" and it basically turns the game into a good-looking remake of older versions. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can see the mod in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jXqt5DSpQg">this video</a> of bad blood inheritor Devil Jin fighting lip-licking Russian slimeball Dragunov. The mod removes the heat bar, the rage state, armoured moves, and tracking attacks. Which is, uh, more or less everything that makes Tekken 8 distinct from its ancestors (and slightly angrier). </p>
<p>Rage, for example, is a glowing red state that you enter on low health, which allows you to bust out a powerful "rage drive" or "rage art" - often a means of regaining some momentum when you're on the ropes. The heat bar is an even newer feature, added in Tekken 8, which lets you chip away at an opponent's health even when they block, among other advantages and uses.</p>
<p>These aggressive fist-augmenting tricks are designed to encourage players to push their opponents (you can read how it works in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>). But not all players seem to be enjoying the resultant pummelings, which can result in quicker fights where one mistake means the match is lost. The mod's maker, "KulaGGin", called the mod's return to classical fighting "how I see real Tekken". The modder also wants to increase the distance players can backdash "for better footsies", make launching attacks reliably unsafe when you whiff, and dial back the ridiculous damage you can currently do with combos. </p>
<p>If you're sold, you can download the mod on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tTMZHRPQvE">Fight Club Discord</a>, as noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-8-fanmade-mod-is-working-to-remove-some-of-the-games-more-polarizing-elements/">Automaton</a>, who first spotted it. To the unTekkened eye, the above brawl between Devil Jin and Dragunov may simply look like more fighting game co-biffery. But to anyone that's played the latest game's onslaught of flashing body parts, it is noticeably clean. A Tekken for purists. </p>
<p>Me? I like the rage state - it's my "smash glass in case of bear" button. And armour moves (which let you absorb a hit as you attack) grant players at least one panicky option if things are going terribly. I would miss them if they were gone. But I could certainly see a "no frills" mode like this being appealing to more grizzled Tekkenistas.</p>
<p>At least it doesn't make the game more like Tekken 4, a game that was so stressful to develop it reportedly caused the game's director to lose <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-hair-on-the-right-side-of-my-body-fell-out-how-tekken-nearly-broke-its-designer-from-stress">all the hair on the right side of his body</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
