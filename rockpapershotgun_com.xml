It's Star Wars Celebration right now, which as I gather is about celebrating giant balls of gas fighting one another. Sorry, I'm being told that it's actually about some multimedia franchise that has so much going on it's impossible to keep track of? Doesn't sound right to me, but I'll have to trust it. Arguably the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Warsy game</a> announcement of the weekend is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-zero-company-looks-like-xcom-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-in-its-first-trailer">first trailer for the Star Wars meets XCOM game Star Wars Zero Company</a>, but it wasn't the only one. Turns out last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' second story pack got a reveal too, and a release date to boot.
</p>

<p>
This one's pirate themed, as evidenced by the DLC's name, A Pirate's Fortune, once again following Kay and Nix on a new adventure in the Khepi system. As is often the case with Star Wars media that isn't the movies, A Pirate's Fortune features one of those Glup Shitto type characters, Hondo Ohnaka, who you'll be joining forces with for this particular escapade. He originally appeared in the animated Clone Wars series, first season even, so even if I jest a touch, he really has been around for a while now.

You'll also be facing off against a new character called Stinger Tash, both of you looking to enter some place called the Khepi Tomb to "uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds." The DLC also adds in the Miyuki Trade League which can net you goodies for your ship, the Trailblazer, and even if you aren't getting A Pirate's Fortune, everyone will also receive some cosmetics inspired by Star Wars: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeleton-crew">Skeleton Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The DLC's out quite soon too, currently due to arrive May 15, less than a month away. I wouldn't bet on any more story stuff after this though, so savour it while you can.

We've all known it's coming for a long while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-are-making-three-new-star-wars-games-including-a-new-strategy-game-with-former-xcom-devs">three years in fact</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> got a proper reveal today. In case you aren't sure which one this was meant to be, it's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> one from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bit-reactor">Bit Reactor</a>, led by former XCOM devs. For the most part the announcement trailer is just a CGI cutscene, you've been round this rodeo before, you know how these things go. Though, it does end with a smidge of gameplay and yeah, it really does just look like Star Wars by way of XCOM, which is likely to be an instant winner.

I'm not exactly sure if "gritty" and "authentic" are words that'd normally apply to any Star Wars media - let's not forget Yoda was literally performed and played by The Muppets' own Fozzie Bear - but that's how Star Wars Zero Command has been described, at the very least. The single-player game is set "during the twilight of the Clone Wars" where you'll play as Hawks, a "former Republic officer" who leads the titular Zero Company.

They're a band of misfits, by the sounds of things, and they've been recruited by Hawks that sees them facing off against some vague threat that could consume the galaxy, or whatever. This is Star Wars, there's always galaxy threatening stuff going on, and this is a prequel so we can only assume things will generally end well - though, in a press release CEO and creative director of Bit Reactor Greg Foertsch did say in a statement that they're aiming to provide "meaningful outcomes" based on the choices you make.
</p>
<p>
The core gameplay looks mighty similar to XCOM, and apparently between missions you'll be able to build up your own base and do spy things like gathering intelligence. On top of that you'll be able to make and customise your own squad of "authored Star Wars characters", so it sounds like you shouldn't expect Jar Jar Binks to show up.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps predictably, an exact release date hasn't been confirmed just yet, but it is supposedly releasing sometime in 2026, and it'll be available on PC via Steam.
