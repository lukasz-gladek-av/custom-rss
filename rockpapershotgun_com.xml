            <p>Back in the mists of 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effects-normandy-sr1is-in-no-mans-sky-now">No Man's Sky revealed its very own Normandy SR1 space frigate</a>. "The Normandy in No Man's Sky?" you cry. "Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a pilotable version in their own space sim.</p>
<p>"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!</p><!--more-->

<p>That's not all they're adding in the latest updates. No Man's Sky now supports cross-save, albeit in limited beta form to begin with. At last, you will be able to transfer all of your console saves to PC, where they belong. Here's some blurb - it sounds like implementing the feature has been atypically tricky.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man's Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p>
<p>It's very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn't even exist back then!</p>
<p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man's Sky players can connect their different platform accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Find the full bulletin about the Normandy/cross-save update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">here</a>. Of course, all this invites the question of when we'll hear more about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. Bioware released an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-release-new-mass-effect-5-epsilon-trailer-while-hinting-about-mass-effect-3-connections">"Epsilon" teaser trailer</a> on N7 Day last year, but the word is they're having a quieter one this year, presumably to avoid stealing any thunder from the recently launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ved-purification">VED: Purificatio</a>n, a free prologue demo to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> VED, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190370/VED_Purification/?curator_clanid=45226842">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, here’s a non-neutral assessment: the voice acting is as rough as the cheap Asda cat litter I bought that was so close to gravel in consistency that I refused to subject my pet to it, so that’s bonus points to the art for carrying my interest. This one’s a turn-based RPG, but with cRPG elements like dialogue choices, multiple endings, and a series of intriguing ‘curses or blessings’, which sound somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>-like. There’s dice rolls and ability loadouts, and most importantly, the gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182420/VED/">Steam page</a> for the main game feature at least one very good giant mushroom bastard. Here’s how the game describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>In VED, you take on the role of Cyrus, a young hero who comes to the city of Micropolis in search of a new life. There he suddenly discovers the ability to teleport between two interconnected worlds full of mysterious flying islands, strange creatures, and dangerous monsters. Unfold an interactive story where each decision matters and help Cyrus discover the truth about this magical place, so that you can decide the fate of two worlds. To succeed in your quest, you will have to master the powerful magic of the Veds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just once, I would like a game to just come out and tell me in the marketing that “only about one third of the decisions you make matter”. Would you not just buy that game immediately, purely out of respect for its honesty? I would. I haven’t played VED of course, so maybe each decision does matter, and maybe “easy to learn but difficult to master” is an accurate description of the combat, too. Who knows! The full game’s out in a week anyway. That’s the 14th of November, and your prologue progress carries over to the big release, should you find yourself a dedicated VEDhead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When multiplayer fishing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> came out last month, it offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs</a>. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

<p>That's in-game money, of course, earned by selling your catch. Not actual human dollars. But it's still a comically large price tag when compared to the other titles in the game, which generally cost $75. To declare your heterosexuality is now the most expensive thing you can do in the game. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625852883021083340/">complaint from a bitter user</a> on Steam demanded a "straight" title, and that is what they got. What's funnier is that the title comes in quotemarks. So you're not straight, you're "straight". </p>
<p>I'm straight. I also find this incredibly funny. As a glib response to a bad faith complaint, it's perfect. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625853246786774999/">another player asked</a> if non-binary items of clothing would make an appearance. In that case, a non-binary title and an accompanying t-shirt were simply added to the game. </p>
<p>All these additions come as part of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444">big "housecleaning" patch</a> that fixes bugs and adds other features. Other titles now available  include "creature" and "cryptid". I'm currently sporting "critter". </p>
<p>Plenty of non-cosmetic changes have been made too. Fishing on ripples in the water now gives you a larger chance of catching better fish. There are multiple save files now, meaning you can rock more than one avatar. Some items can be stacked up to 99. The inventory menus have been reworked. One note in the changelog simply says: "Added the ???????? which is accessed through the ???? ?????? and ??? ????????" - colour me intrigued. There are also now 18+ lobbies to try to ensure chat is safer for young players. (Although all this means is that players have to accept a pop-up when joining 18+ servers. Not exactly perfect but better than nothing.)</p><p>"The launch product was rushed and a bit of a mess," said creator "lamedeveloper" in the update post, pointing out that the entire development time of the game totalled just 5 months. "I ended up not really being proud of the product I had put out. Hopefully, this patch addresses most of the major issues with the game (and I can finally sleep a bit)."</p>
