            <p>
Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> was announced, we knocked it for offering zappy muzak in place of the TV show’s official theme. Gamexcite and Daedalic have added the theme, now, and I sort of wish they hadn’t. “Help!” I screeched to my bedroom walls, as the rousingly sorrowful opening bars wafted from the speakers like nitrous oxide. “A videogame is making me feel something! It is making me feel like 31 years have passed, and I can still remember Neelix getting drunk on water. I still remember the Doctor’s first words. I still remember blowing up the Caretaker Array rather than using it to insta-warp home.” 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can choose not to blow up the Caretaker Array in Across the Unknown, but I was too chickenshit to witness the consequences of leaving such a device in the hands of the bullying, bouffanted Kazon. That’s not what Janeway would have done, and while Across the Unknown’s Janeway has a certain demon Botox energy, she looks the part closely enough to command my loyalty. Let us go forth, Captain! There’s <em>coffee</em> out there in these nebulae.

<p>
We were a Star Trek/Buffy/Simpsons household back in the 90s, tuning in at 6pm sharp after school to get our fill of phasers, Spike and Moleman, save for those days when the Beeb would stiff us with an episode of Neighbors. While the spectacle of Voyager sliding over gas giant rings remains pristine in my mind, there are definitely a few bits I’ve forgotten. 
</p><p>
For example, I don’t remember Voyager spending this much time hurrying between planets to stock up on Deuterium for the warp engine. I don’t remember the crew losing faith in you if you fail to build a new storage room in time. These are the managerial intricacies they edit out of 30 minute TV episodes, but thanks to the magic of videogames, the one true artform, we are free to sign in exasperation because we can no longer research a new transponder amplifier after running out of juice. Fortunately, power-outs don’t (so far) interfere with your ability to move around and gather resources.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t remember Tom Paris looking this avuncular. Whatever star fitfully smiled upon the conception of this game’s Janeway smirked in contempt when Daedalic gave flesh to nu-Paris. He’s so… sturdy! He still talks like the old Paris, though, which is to say, like a snarky little flyboy, and he’s fared better than Kes, who looks like she’s been dunked in custard. In general, the script approximately matches my memories of the old cast, though it’s a sparser creation with no voice-acting, carried along by dialogue choices that sort of usher you through old plotlines, while occasionally giving you the chance to deviate from canon. I haven’t done much deviating so far, unless you count sabotaging morale by failing to open a new locker room within 30 cycles.
</p>
<p>
Across the Unknown divides your labours as follows. Firstly, you click to scan and move Voyager around procedurally generated star systems, with time paused until you set a course. Secondly, you manage the ship’s interior, a cutaway dollhouse simulation akin to latter-day XCOM base management, with rooms and systems to clear and build according to a resource budget. Thirdly, you send people with different skillsets off on away missions that consist of a series of Choose Your Own Adventure challenges. Fourthly, you autobattle with 3D spaceships, giving Voyager orders that reflect the state of your shields, hull and critical systems, while performing crew special abilities with a cooldown.
</p>
<p>
After an hour mostly spent in the prologue, I wouldn’t call any of this mindblowing. It’s a bog-standard Holodeck recreation of bits of other games. It also makes me newly sad that we’ll never get to play the finished version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumplight-odyssey">Jumplight Odyssey</a>. Still, Across The Unknown doesn’t have any obvious major problems, as yet, and if your memories of the show are copious yet fading, the Proustian euphoria of recognising the specific arrangement of command chairs on the Voyager bridge may convince you to forgive the straightforward moving parts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across The Unknown</a> is out today on Steam. The demo's still live if you fancy it.

            <p>Rubbing shoulders with factions is a big part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> charm, even if it often devolves into you doing a bunch of favours if you don't want to risk ending up on the vilified naughty list for one too many accidental grenade pickpocktings. You do get some nice perks for keeping the likes of the NCR or Legion on side, but a new mod aims to take that to a new level, letting you send faction cronies out on handy odd jobs while you kick your feet up.</p>

<p>The mod's called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96429">U_DO_IT - Faction Quest Assigner</a>' and is the work of SkullzyRS, the creator of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3433">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2466">number</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4497">of</a> popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> mods. They've recently turned their hands to New Vegas for a project I can't recall off the top of my head as having been done previously in Obsidian's radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.</p>
<p>"I love to roleplay and have always wanted to step into the shoes of NPC man and get someone to do the dirty work for me, so this is the beginning of that idea," the modder wrote in the description of their creation. "The goal would eventually be to get NPCs to actually be able to complete minor or trivial 'go there, get that, bring back' fetch quests for you while you focus on the real and exciting... fetch quests lol, but this is what I have for now as quest editing has been a notoriously bad area to play with in general, so baby steps at the moment."</p><p>In its current form, Faction Quest Assigner adds a command device to your inventory that you can use to send NPCs from eight different Mojave factions out on. These jobs are all done offscreen and range from the likes of patrolling and scavenging to sabotage and assassinations. Once you've picked a job, you pick one of four difficulty tiers to dictate how long the job'll take, what rewards you might net from it, and the percentage chance of your goons failing to complete it.</p>
<p>Naturally, the higher the risk, the higher the reward - often in caps or items, plus a dollop of positive rep with that faction. In order to limit the ability to cheese your way straight into the hearts of every group, these little missions come with a cooldown of three in-game days. Overall, I can certainly see it as the sort of mod I might use to help keep the latter stages of a New Vegas playthrough busy. Sure, by that point I'm usually off DLCing, but it's handy to have ways of making it feel like things are still happening on the war front once you reach the pint when everyone's just waiting for the second battle of Hoover Dam to kick off.</p>
<p>Plus, who could reject the idea of being able to roleplay as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-fallout-tv-show-season-2">Fallout TV Show season 2</a>'s Legate Home Alone. Now, if only I can get these cronies to carry me on a big throne...</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is in a bit of a Schrödinger's cat situation. That's because at the time of writing, the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">official site</a> only shows the shooter's logo, and text that reads "This site is currently unavailable. Please contact support@codethirtytwo.com for assistance," alongside links to its official Discord server and Dwitter page. This, of course, could just be a blip, but even as I'm writing this it's been the case for several hours, and there's not a single word from developer Wildlight about why it's down. So, it is both dead and not dead until someone opens the box.
</p>
<p>
This obviously isn't an immediate confirmation that the game is shutting down, but given that last week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">most of the team was apparently laid off</a>, there is certainly reason to question whether this is that famed writing on the wall you so often hear about. The silence from Wildlight in both the game's Discord server and social pages certainly adds to the writing.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to all of this, a report has emerged from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment">Game File</a> that sheds a tidbit of light on how Highguard came to be. Namely, that the game was predominantly funded by Tencent. It's been unknown up to this point just who funded the game, given Wildlight's proud proclamation of independence.
</p>
<p>
The framing of Wildlight as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">indie studio</a> by founder Dusty Welch has been a sticking point for me since the moment I heard it, seeing as prior to the layoffs it was a 100+ person company. To hear a report that Wildlight were funded by a company as massive as Tencent doesn't offer me any sense of vindication, more frustration at the hubris at those at the top to think they can just repeat the success they previously had many years of changing industry trends later.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, here's hoping that those affected by the layoffs end up on their feet, and much the same to those who may or may not be out of work by the end of the week.
