            <p>I didn't sleep last night for entirely self-inflicted reasons and my brain feels like that one accursed hoover bag you refuse to empty, because there is no way of doing so that won't turn the neighbourhood into Silent Hill. I need to avoid any complicated write-ups, or my brain will detonate similarly and paint north London grey.</p>
<p>Ah, a minigolf game! I think I can just about hack the concept of minigolf, on this most desperate of Mondays. It is golf but mini. Bonzai golf. Digestible! Intuitive! Why, I've managed to write 100 words without even looking at the Steam page. Let's do so now. Wait a minute, this isn't minigolf. It's Mini Mini Golf Golf. What is Mini Mini Golf Golf? "Destabilize the present and plunge into a neon psychohistory of a bizarre entity in distress," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3188050/Mini_Mini_Golf_Golf/">the Steam page explains</a>. "This is not a game about minigolf." It is too late to flee.</p><!--more-->

<p>Find a demo for Mini Mini Golf Golf on the Steam page. It's kind of great. I don't encourage you to play it if you're having trouble seeing straight. There appear to be two halves to the game. On the one hand, you are a scientist of sorts operating snazzy retro gadgets aboard a space station in the distant, post-apocalyptic future. You've got a sexy, self-ticking digital clipboard, and a bank of signal displays redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a>, which need to be tuned to siphon cryptic footage from static. </p><p>On the other hand, you can use one of the displays to play isometric minigolf. It's pretty simple, at first: drag-click the mouse to aim and power up a shot. Classic Atari fodder. But then Plot happens, and the minigolf game-within-the-game comes over all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>.</p>
<p>The courses evolve from cutesy dioramas into connectible grid fragments and chunks of abstract factory line. One level resembles a map of tectonic activity. The ball starts to spell out words. "Nice to meet you," it says. Look ball, I am just trying to play regular minigolf. Quantum, sentient minigolf is not within my operational capacity right now - I can barely count up to 10.</p>
<p>The ball has no time for my immense fatigue and suffering. It wishes to tell me about its difficult childhood. "The psychohistory of the entity you encounter is fragmented, tainted and biased," the Steam page continues. "It is incomplete, more than human, and tired."</p>
<p>Mini Mini Golf Golf is out on 28th November. It was the wrong game for me this morning, but it feels like the right game for me at some stage. I have never seen anybody deliver dialogue by means of a golf ball before, or use that golf ball to model earthquakes. Perhaps there's a level in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-the-golf">What The Golf?</a> that compares?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I didn‚Äôt get much further in the extremely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-is-live-with-an-early-glimpse-of-the-new-camping-wound-and-weather-systems">popular beta</a> for the haute-couture-asaurus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action </a>of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn‚Äôt having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn‚Äôt spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I‚Äôm getting the sense there‚Äôs been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a <a href="https://x.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522">clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma</a>, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.</p>
<!--more--> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you felt like the combat in the MHWilds beta felt "off," it's not just you! As this short comparison video shows, Capcom seems to have reduced hitstop on most (if not all) weapon types in Wilds, leading to some weapons ùòßùò¶ùò¶ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò® worse than they did in prior games. <a href="https://t.co/PRIbkdEFTP">pic.twitter.com/PRIbkdEFTP</a></p>‚Äî Blue Stigma (@Axelayer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The Oxford English Above Video defines 'Hitstop' as a brief animation pause the moment a weapon connects with an enemy, meant to sell you on that weapon's weight and power. The more frames in the hitstop, the more exaggerated the impact of the attack - up to a point. Blue Stigma uses the switch axe in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate as an example. The hitstop for its overhead swing lasts eight frames. The game runs at 30fps, so Blue Stigma reckons that‚Äôs about a quarter of second you‚Äôve got to register how ‚Äúpretty damn strong‚Äù the attack is.</p>
<p>So, what‚Äôs the problem in Wilds? Comparing the same attack across different entries, Blue Stigma offers similar results: A quarter of a second in Rise, and one fifth in Monster Hunter World. In the Wilds beta, however, there‚Äôs a grand total of <em>zero frames</em> of hitstop, causing the axe to feel puny in comparison. Some weapons and attacks in Wilds do have hitstop comparable to past entries, says Blue Stigma, but many have reduced hitstop, or none at all. The result is much limper and less satisfying combat across the board.</p>
<p>I should add that I personally have no expertise in this exact area, preferring to use much fluffier terms when talking about combat, so there might well be more - or less - going on here than the clip suggests. ‚ÄúSlow bonk make bonk feel good‚Äù certainly scans to me, though.</p>
<p>Blue Stigma makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheRealFolkBlues/videos">YouTube videos under ‚ÄòBlue‚Äô</a>, so do go show them some love if you found the breakdown interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of my lesser quality tests for an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is whether the shopkeepers complain at you for not buying anything. Grumpy shopkeepers, good RPG. This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I‚Äôd happily upgrade it to ‚Äòshopkeepers you can attack‚Äô, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/THYSIASTERY">Thysiastery</a>, it turns out. This ‚Äúdungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay‚Äù apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You‚Äôd be a monster for it, of course, but it‚Äôs nice to have options.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCommand a party of bearers of the Brand, drawn into a vast Labyrinth. Recruit while exploring the Labyrinth in hope of finding a way out, and its secrets will be revealed as you delve deeper,‚Äù reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140180/THYSIASTERY/">Steam page</a>. The basic premise here should be familiar to anyone who‚Äôs played old-school dungeon crawlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/dungeons-dragons">Eye Of The Beholder</a>, or modern revivals like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legend-of-grimrock">Legend Of Grimrock</a>. Your party of four shuffles around in first person, turn-basedly slaying monsters with attacks like ‚Äòfemur breaker‚Äô and ‚Äòlobotomise‚Äô. You‚Äôll level up, hoover up shinies, make discoveries. You know. Adventure shit. Here are some more details:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Turn-based combat in which your choices allow you to capitalize on chance and weakness - or be similarly exploited.</li>
<li>Classic roguelike features such as permadeath, procedurally generated areas and randomly generated characters that provide a highly replayable game.</li>
<li>A great number of skills for characters to learn and discover, then teach further to other characters.</li>
<li>A number of difficulty modifiers to amp up or down the difficulty.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>No solid release date on this one just yet - it‚Äôs slated for ‚ÄúQ2 2025‚Äù. Maybe the merchant will tell you if you rough ‚Äòem up a bit? There‚Äôs always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark And Darker</a> in the meantime if you like a little multiplayer looting with your dungeon crawling.</p></div>

            <p>Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.</p>
<p>We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing," Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© observed last week at a BAFTA event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">attended by Eurogamer</a>. The series has experimented with a new Animus wielder, Layla Hassan, but Cot√© feels Ubisoft have failed to weave an impactful and consistent narrative around her, not least because the overarching AC plot of warring Templar and Assassin orders has become a lacklustre hunt for ancient alien McGuffins.</p>
<p>"The continued focus on characters hunting for Isu artefacts made the narrative more predictable," Cot√© went on, "and reduced the conflict between Templars and Assassins to a straightforward pursuit of control over - let's be honest - magical relics. This shift pulled focus away from what had always been at the heart of the franchise: exploring our history. </p><p>"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern, more of a side-quest, rather than an integral part of the overall experience," he said. "Furthermore, the compounded complexity of 15 years of lore built in this parallel storyline created a cognitive load that made the franchise difficult to approach for newcomers." </p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first step on the road toward putting "history back at the centre of the players' experience," Cot√© explained, with a modern-day narrative that "will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey". You can expect a "meaningful contrast between past and present". </p>
<p>To be more specific, "the modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future.</p>
<p>"These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history," Cot√© concluded. "The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come." </p><p>It all sounds very grand. The less grand practical reality is that all the modern-day stuff will sit within a new Assassin's Creed meta-game hub, a project previously known as Assassin's Creed Infinity. If I were a cynical man, and I do try to be, I'd say Assassin's Creed's modern-day component is coming back as a set of animated cyberpunk wallpapers for a bog-standard game launcher.</p>
<p>I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">cautiously enthusiastic</a> about the 30 minutes of choreographed Shadows footage I saw at Summer Games Fest this year. I tend to be cautiously enthusiastic about anything that whiffs of Tenchu, mind. The new open worlder was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">delayed into 2025</a> following an Ubisoft share slump abetted by "soft" sales of Star Wars Outlaws. I'm not sure a rejuvenated modern-day component is the secret sauce, here, but I'm interested to see what they mean by "reflect on contemporary issues". Just please don't bring back Desmond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
