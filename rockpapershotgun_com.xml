            <p>
It's been seven years since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>, and in all that time, I've somehow never noticed that the title is a reference to sleepless penury. My mind jumped to the association of moonlight with magic and romance, skimming clean over the less enchanting sense of "moonlighting" as working a second job after dark. Luckily, this knowledge has dawned on me just in time to softly kneecap my enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, which launches into early access today, and appears quite a bit different from its predecessor.

What's the same? Well, it's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">a real-time action-RPG about having a second job as a village storekeeper</a>. By day, you stock shelves with potions, etcetera and work the till. By night, you head into the catacombs to replenish your wares. 
</p>
<p>
What's changed? Well, it's now a 3D game with an angled aerial camera, rather than a top-down pixelganza. They've also moved away from the original Zelda or Binding Of Isaac-style dungeon format. Instead of an expanse of rooms that seal you in till you've killed all their monsters, you'll be picking from branching paths as in a roguelike such as Hades.</p><p>The inventory management side has been re-puzzlified with (for example) new items that consume adjacent items, perhaps gaining in strength for every treasure they eat. The shop management stuff is more elaborate, with new modifiers to boost the value of otherwise homely goods.
</p>
<p>Developers Digital Sun and publishers 11-Bit aren't sure how long it'll be in early access. The current version includes three dungeon biomes with their own enemies, around 120 relics, four main weapons, and roughly 100 shop and dungeon perks. The final version will have more environments, bosses, loot, NPCs, quests and story stuff, plus expanded shop systems, events and customisation options. All this plus the customary bugfixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>
Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/">Steam</a>. I enjoyed the first Moonlighter, and I'm uncertain about the new dungeons and visual direction, but the inventory and shop enhancements sound worthwhile on paper. To circle back to my intro, I'm a bit concerned that I can be persuaded to overlook exploitative or precarious working conditions if they're presented to me in fluffy fantasy language. Please do not start referring to staff cuts as Ye Olde Layoffs, publishers.

            <p>
I won't comment on the quality of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, the game, because I've not had the chance to play it, though obviously it's not been received with all that much fanfare. You know what I did quite like? Marathon, the short film, the one that came with the game's reveal from Alberto Mielgo. It felt like a strong promise of a (more-or-less) fresh sci-fi world, the performances were subdued, it felt larger than life. Good stuff! Yet as many things currently are, it's been scrutinised over potential AI use, prompting Mielgo to put out a (understandably aggro) statement.
</p>
<p>
Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/">Instagram</a>, Mielgo said that he couldn't believe "we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO." He went on to note that everything in the film, including "paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders [were] done with [a] huge team - 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time."
</p>
<p>
On the topic of what Mielgo's personal opinion on AI was, he perhaps more sheepishly noted that he has "no idea." To his credit, he followed that up by saying that "AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced." He then sort of ruined that sentiment by finishing with the line, "this text was kindly edited with ChatGPT," a line written so dryly I honestly can't tell if it's a joke or not (I hope so).
</p>
<p>
In seemingly now-deleted comments on the same Instagram post (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">The Game Post</a>), Mielgo responded to someone asking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">Marathon's plagiarism issue</a>, obviously a hot button topic in the world of AI, and his thoughts on the fact that some of these plagiarised assets may have been handed off to the director to make his short film with. He explained, "you know what I hate the most? Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers. Go whistle around."
</p><p>
To be unfair to both Mielgo and Bungie, there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">has been</a> a <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">pattern</a> of <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">plagiarism issues</a> at the studio over the years. A one off is one thing, but this is notably questionable. Anyway, I do think people should stop trying to sniff out AI use because annoyingly the stuff is getting better at making "art", so let's put our focus into just completely snuffing it out, yeah?
