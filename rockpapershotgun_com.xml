            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzards-old-manual-art-is-a-real-nostalgia-trip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, and the world will feel my pain. </p>
<p>Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of <a href="https://www.frazettamuseum.com/collections/framed-art">Frank Frazetta</a>'s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">his excellent Space Marine piece</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, a valued RPS community member <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">on the Discord</a> shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. </p>

<p>Here's the piece in question. Shout out to CMaster on the Discord. </p>

<p>Thing is, I've most definetely seen this piece before, because the original <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/StarCraft.PDF">Starcraft manual</a> that houses it was primo toilet reading back in the day. But it was still a shock seeing it again, especially considering how different it is to the style I associate Blizzard with currently. Here's a few more for the Zerg and Protos.</p>

The mutalisk, especially, isn't worlds away from some of Starcraft II's art. But things get really interesting when you look at a few bits from <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/Warcraft%202%20Battlenet%20edition.PDF">Warcraft II's manual</a>.

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/warcraft-2-manual-orcs.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure><p>

In contrast, here's a more recent orc from <a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/World-of-Warcraft/Focus/Warlords-of-Draenor-concept-art">Blizzard's archives</a>. As far as I can tell, it's a concept piece from the 2014 expansion Warlords Of Draenor.

<p>If you prefer this more recent piece, I absolutely get it. While I'm not a fan of the softness and stylisation myself, it's very distinctly a Warcraft orc. This could just be an effect of familiarity, sure, but you could identify that as Blizzard immediately, while the older piece could be from any number of DIY, grungy OSR manuals. Personally, though, that's why I love it.</p>
<p>Here's a human. Sorry about the text. Bloody love their text, humans do.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's it, that's the post! As I said, figured a few of you might get a kick out of seeing the old art, especially if it's your first time. Also, I'm contractually obligated to write 'orc' at least twelve times a week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it's sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

<p>
If you see anything paranormal, scoot on back to the factory floor and hit the red button to condemn the structure. If the building appears normal, press the green one (you won't, seemingly, have to worry about other habit certification requirements, such as checking that all the kitchens have fire blankets - different department, I guess). In the event of a haunting, the predictable complication is that the spooks might not let you leave. Quite why your employer keeps accidentally building haunted houses remains to be seen. Where exactly do they get the logs for those walls?
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Cabin Factory partly because it could be an amazing prank. Maybe none of the cabins harbour ghosts! Perhaps the whole thing is a vicious social experiment on the part of developers International Cat Studios, to see how many players can be induced to imagine supernatural antics. 
</p><p>
It would be a neat way to save development resources with regard to ghoulish lighting effects, fraught violin soundtracks and such. Perhaps other self-described "horror" games could follow their example. Imagine a Silent Hill game in which Silent Hill is a perfectly unremarkable town, haunted only by the spectres players bring in with them. Hang on, isn't that what Silent Hill is anyway?
</p>
<p>
The other thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is the precise level of eerieness that separates a haunted house from a house that just has a lot of shoddy wiring and ill-fitting carpentry. What kinds of layout, atmospheric elements, and special effects will they introduce that provoke alarm but do not kindle the certainty of an eldritch infestation? How do you tune, say, a creaking floorboard so that it sounds almost like the footfall of a poltergeist but, on reflection, is probably just a creaking floorboard? What species of rising damp looks almost, but not entirely like the Babadook?
</p>
<p>

The third thing that interests me about The Cabin Factory is that it could be a commentary on game testing. It gives International Cat Studios a certain leeway when it comes to glitches - that's interference from beyond the grave, not a misbehaving shader! I wonder if there's any odds of a licensed multiplayer mode where they wheel on houses from other, unfinished games and have you comb them for frame-rate drops styled as phantom interventions, using a PKE Meter that actually just shows you a graph of CPU activity.
</p>
<p>
The Cabin Factory is out 13th December. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/">read more on Steam</a>. The obvious movie pairing here is Cabin In The Woods.

            <p>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesn’t get you very far, at least you put in an honest day’s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that don’t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.</p>
<p>Also, coincidentally, all things you can do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3128740/Beff_Jezos_Simulator/">in the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beff-jezos-simulator">Beff Jezos Simulator</a>. Now, work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation games</a> aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?</p>

<p>In this wonderful fantasy allegory - like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> but for people who, when they say 'let them cook,' are preparing to slurp a stew made entirely of boot - you can also perform these premium fantasy billionaire activities:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fulfill Orders Efficiently: Pack items quickly and accurately, manage customer service, and keep satisfaction high!</li>
<li>Grow Your Business: Hire a skilled team, expand packaging stations, and even open a warehouse as demand soars.</li>
<li>Upgrade Your Skills: Unlock powerful abilities like bulk shipping, advanced sales insights, and marketing strategies through a rich skill tree!</li>
<li>Real-World E-Commerce Mechanics: Face real challenges like inventory management, pricing strategies, and keeping customers happy.</li>
<li>Adapt to Market Trends: Stock popular items and adjust quickly to shifts in demand to keep profits high.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I’m not spotting anything about buying entire media outlets to gradually influence public opinion into thinking bald divorced men with all the basic empathy of a mouldy satsuma are actually extremely fuckable and cool, but I’m sure that’s in there somewhere too.</p>
<p>What would you do if you were a billionaire, reader? I would buy the world a copy of Beff Jezos Simulator <em>and</em> a really lovely bottle to piss in. Wide rimmed. Sturdy. Leak-proof. The works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is expanding yet again with 12 new subclasses, including drunk monks, teleporting beekeepers and shadow sorcerors]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors.1047210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> patch 7 would be their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-update-will-be-larians-final-handover-to-players">final handover to players</a> of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two currently untitled new game projects</a>. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be "diminished", there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.</p>
<p>The subclasses in question are a fanciful bunch. Take Drunken Master for the Monk class, which lets you intoxicate enemies and then rapidly sober them up to inflict physical and psychic damage. As a Ranger Swarmkeeper, meanwhile, you can wield a "legion of bees" like a battering ram and then teleport to the swarm's location to stick the boot in. The Fighter's Arcane Archer subclass lets you temporarily banish people to another dimension, the Cleric's Dark Domain lets you blow up corpses, and the Rogue's Swashbuckler gets to flick sand in faces, jolt weapons from hands and generally speaking just wind adversaries up. Fire up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735?l=english">the Steam announcement post</a> for the full list.</p>
<p>As for the new photo mode, this gives you a bunch of lens settings such as FOV and focus level, together with scene settings such as the ability to toggle off either party members, NPCs and enemies. It also lets you choose facial expressions and pick from around 40 static and animated poses, each with variations. There are also post-processing effects such as contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignetting, and a choice of frames and stickers.</p>
<p>The sweetener is full cross-play functionality with full cross-platform progression. No longer will that Xbox player you know have to play Baldur's Gate 3 solo. You'll be able to invite them into your game and, as the case may be, cover them in angry bees. </p>
<p>There's no release date for the patch just yet, but Larian are doing early public "stress-testing" in early January. You'll be able to register your interest beforehand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
