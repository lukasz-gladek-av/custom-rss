            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's petition to the European Commission has hit a major milestone, surpassing a million signatures. However, the YouTuber behind this effort to stop companies from rendering games unplayable by shutting down their servers is still asking for more folks to get their pens out and sign, due to concerns about fakery.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ross Scott originally launched <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">back in 2024</a>, after Ubisoft pulled racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline. Cue a lot of debates about terms of service which tell folks that when you buy a game, you're not buying permanent access to it, but rather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">a license to play it</a> for as long as it exists.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">European Citizens' Initiative</a> has crossed 1 million signatures. Except it hasn't," Scott announced in a video update uploaded to his channel Accursed Farms yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody's mistakes."</p>
<p>"That could be a lot," he continued, "I've heard 10% minimum, 20% is better, 40% should be really safe." The second issue is that Scott says he's "received several reports of people claiming to [have spoofed] signatures on the initiative site."</p>

<p>"First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition. This is a government process," Scott continues. "Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this."</p>
<p>It's unclear at this point whether any folks spoofing signatures on the EU petition might end up being prosecuted for doing so, but it won't invalidate the campaign as a whole. However, the fact Scott's even heard talk of such a thing has left him unsure of exactly how many real signatures he's got. He reckons there are "at least 600–700k" at current.</p>
<p>Hence him <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">asking for EU citizens</a> to keep on signing legitimately. As of writing, the EU petition is at 1,091,165 signatures, with a million having been the goal that would lead the European Commission to at least look into the issue.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games also has a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/">UK petition</a>, which currently has just over 150k signatures, and looks set to receive a date when it'll be debated in parliament soon. That said, the UK Government have already issued a response to that petition back in February, which reads: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games. Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue."</p>
<p>"I would bet money on the EU initiative delivering something good if it passes, but the UK has been more about exhausting all options," Scott says in the video. He adds regarding that previous response from UK politicians: "A member of Parliament could sneeze on the petition, and that would not be a worse answer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The studio making underwater survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have promised fans that "nothing has changed" despite a recent drastic change in leadership at the company. The game is still planned to be a single player survival adventure with optional co-op.</p>
<p>"Nothing has changed with how the game is structured," said a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement posted to Unknown World's website</a> yesterday. "It will remain a single-player first experience, with optional co-operative multiplayer. No subscriptions. No loot boxes. No battle pass. No microtransactions." Okay nameless statement, this still dosn't clear anything up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We know that you have a lot of questions and concerns about the news from our publisher regarding the leadership changes at Unknown Worlds," it begins, and then spends eight paragraphs not answering those questions. "We’re also supporting Steve Papoutsis as he transitions into his role as CEO at Unknown Worlds. He’s already expressed his excitement to check out everything we’ve been working on."

</p><p>Earlier this week Krafton, the publishers who own Unknown Worlds, announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">three senior staff members were being replaced by an executive</a> from one of their other studios. Steve Papoutsis, who worked on sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>, is now the CEO of the studio. Those leaving include studio co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire. </p>
<p>In the press release which made that announcement, there were some lines about a renewed commitment to "achieving regular milestones". The subtext is that Krafton believed Unknown Worlds were not working fast enough. Their new guy, they suggest, will commit to regular checks from on-high.</p>

<p>"These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations."</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> (hi) are squinting heavily at the megapublisher with untrusting eyes. Hence yesterday's damage control in the form of a "letter to our community", which is mostly a defence of incoming CEO Papoutsis and his benefactors at Krafton.</p>
<p>"We want to reassure you that KRAFTON feels strongly about supporting that vision at the studio, as we continue to navigate the game toward Early Access," the letter continues. "While we work closely with Steve and get him up to speed with all the amazing work the team has already done on Subnautica 2, we also understand that it means we’ll need to ask you to remain a little patient and support us as he comes on board."</p>
<p>They go on to promise that a new schedule and early access timeline will be coming soon, but still don't answer any obvious questions about this whole drama. Ousting the long-serving leaders of a studio and installing a former EA producer who presided over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-hardline">Battlefield Hardline</a> is a drastic assertion of control. So what happened? Why kick out those three specific people? Should more people expect to be laid off? Will the team face the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-callisto-protocol-proves-that-crunch-is-dumb">reportedly disastrous crunch conditions that affected The Callisto Protocol</a>? No answers are forthcoming.</p>

</figure>
<p>The studio promises not to fill the game with lootboxes, and okay, thanks? Lootboxes are not the real worry, and the game is reportedly so far along in development it would likely be technically unfeasible to introduce such features anyway. The real worry is that the culture, morale, and day-to-day working experience at Unknown Worlds may alter for the worse. </p>
<p>A final wrinkle in the story: former studio head Charlie Cleveland says he is "Now making some films!" on LinkedIn. This comes after he recently moved to LA and set up a movie company, the website for which is awash with <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">generative AI movie posters</a> and <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/zeroes">wonky-faced placeholder images</a>. Which I imagine might distract someone from actual game development. But unless anyone involved speaks plainly about this messy situation, all we will have is speculation.</p>

            <p>January 12th, 2026. It's my next birthday, and also now the date that BioWare exosuit shooter Anthem will finally be taken offline. I very much assume the two things are unrelated.</p>
<p>The live-service thing that EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-canceling-their-anthem-overhaul-to-focus-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age">abandoned doing live-service stuff for</a> not that long after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">well-documentedly difficult development</a> was followed by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">lukewarm release</a> is finally going the way of the dodo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," EA wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">a post</a> on their website, "This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline."</p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that," the publisher added, also letting us know that this shutdown isn't resulting in any layoffs. It might seem a strange clarification to make - Anthem hasn't been a going concern for years and EA have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">sliced BioWare's staff</a> post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Veilguard</a>, but I guess the company have just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">read the room</a> for once and want to make clear any potential consequences for the developers, rather than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">sliding around the subject</a> as they have in other announcements.</p>
<p>Once that plug's pulled, Anthem will cease to be playable since it's an online-only affair. That means you've got roughly 192 days to do as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-huh-biowares-exosuit-shooter-anthem-is-still-online">our Alice O did back in 2023</a> - suddenly remember that Anthem exists and hop in to give it a go like you're taking one last joyride in an old car that'll never get the work done to stop it imminently being resigned to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>She wrote the following of that sojourn to the abandoned kingdom of Anthem:</p>
<blockquote>Is Anthem good? No. It's a looter-shooter with boring loot and perfunctory shoot. But I like parts," "Flying my cool-looking exosuit around is pleasant, lazily swooping around the skies of an alien world. It's an involved movement too, because the suit slowly heats up and you need to regularly cool it by diving downwards or flying through waterfalls and such. I'm always happy when simply getting about involves playful little motions. And I'm kind of interested in some of the traditionally BioWare-y NPC chatter and storybits going on back at the hub base? But the rest of the game's not good enough for me to persist.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I've just checked and assuming you don't already own it, you'll need to pay for an EA Play subscription to try <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/buy/pc">Anthem on PC</a> before its song is sung. The game's also set to be removed from that service in 43 days' time, as of writing, so your window's suddenly gotten a lot smaller.</p></div>

<p>As is good journalistic practise, I'll start with the bit I find the funniest, conceptually, especially if I imagine it as a newspaper headline. "Several towns have been moved closer to water". Rivers have also been widened, and bridges have been "reconsidered". This is all part of TaleWorld's efforts to reshape "the very veins of the continent", ostensibly to widen the maritime trade network, though I suspect it's actually just to give you more targets to boat batter.</p>
<blockquote><p>"For settlements now hugging rivers and coasts, danger sails closer — rival ports are now just a voyage away. To meet this new maritime threat, both parties and armies can now travel by water, gaining access to naval movement and combat."</p></blockquote>
<p>The world map is also being expanded with "a new rugged long strip of a south-facing coastline". Coincidentally, rugged long is also my stripper name. Here's the map:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>TaleWorlds Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Returning to coastline plundering, TaleWorlds have also detailed the part naval warfare will play in sieges. Namely blockades, which will be automatically formed after setting up a siege camp, as long as the siege target is a naval settlement and the besiegers have ships available. As a player, you can also reinforce besieged towns from water - "either by breaking through the blockade at the cost of some troops, or by attacking the fleet directly to lift it."</p>
<p>A few other bits of interest: If you dock and then go pottering about on land, you'll be able to summon your ships again from any coastal town. Sailing itself will be aided or hindered by wind speed and currents, and you'll have to contend with attrition, from hazards like storms and regular old disrepair, while you're out there.</p>
<p>How is Bannerlord these days? I played it for about fifty very good hours when it came out and haven't touched it since. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review">reviewed it back in 2022</a> and didn't reckon it was a meaningful upgrade from the previous. "I still enjoy Bannerlord because there's nothing else doing those open world battles," she wrote. "But almost everything else is a robotic, shallow grind offering no surprises, with a plethora of complaints that early access is supposed to iron out".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-expansion-is-terraforming-the-land-to-encourage-maximum-boat-bastardry]]></content:encoded>
