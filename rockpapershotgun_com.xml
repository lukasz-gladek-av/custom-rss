            <p>Co-operative starship mishap sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-space">Jump Space</a> just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/543372164837935536">the first major update</a> of its early access phase, bringing both functional capitalism and a surprisingly enjoyable trio of melee weapons. The former takes the shape of newly opened item shops at your home base, giving you a chance to stock up on guns, repair kits, or artifact buffs before shipping out on a mission. And, having thwacked a few bots with the latter, I’m liking how worthy they are of a precious weapon slot, even in a game previously set up entirely for gunplay.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Besides their generous impact damage, the newly added wrench, crowbar, and sci-fi Heatblade sword can – with a timely block – deflect laser blasts back at the mechanoid dickhead who fired them. Yes, Jump Space now has parrying, which I’m aware in 2025 is the action game equivalent of saying <em>wow, this strategy game’s got deckbuilding in it</em>. But I still think these three hittin' sticks are good additions, for two reasons: one, they add a needed extra dimension to Jump Space’s otherwise simplistic shooting, and two, it’s simply a right old laugh to perform laser-bouncing ninja nonsense with what is outwardly a completely mundane pipe wrench.</p>
<p>Basically: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crsO5CO3KTA">Oh, good. Why that’s very good. Yes, I like that.</a></p>
<figure>

<p>The shops aren’t as interesting, though I imagine the ability to quickly tool back up with basic guns might take some sting out of losing your upgraded arsenal in a failed run. Speaking of which, the patch notes also share some of Keepsake Games' thinking on equipment permanence: in short, it doesn’t sound like they’re adding the (apparently much-requested) option to stash favourite guns for safekeeping, though the plan is to make higher-tier loot spawns more common. "This will make good weapons frequent enough that hugging your MK3 for dear life won't be players’ top priority," the post explains.</p><p>Back in the present, this update also adds a handful of mission modifiers, potentially throwing in yet more baddie spaceships to dogfight or extra salvaging opportunities, as well as a little Hallowe'en event involving the fetch-questing of pumpkins. Your reward? Another pumpkin, specifically one to wear on your head. It presumably still protects you against the vacuum of space, unlike the ones they have in Tesco.</p>
<p>Jump Space still has a lot of early access jumping to do. Nothing here fixes its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spark-of-co-op-magic-keeps-jump-space-flying-though-early-access-turbulence">biggest issue of mission and environment repetition</a>, which will need solving if it’s to have real legs. This patch feels like a pretty good enough start, though.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s battle royale mode has a name, and it isn’t quite as awful as I was expecting, falling well short of the exhilarating cringe of "Battlefortnite". Battlefield REDSEC, they’re calling it. Such a Tom Clancelled, Limp Bizkit-ass moniker. What does REDSEC stand for, EA? Rampant Ennui Detected, Send Emergency Cookies? Or is it a game about hunting down commie office assistants? See, this is why they pay me the big bananas here at Rock Paper Shitpun Dot Com.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The more momentous news here is that REDSEC will be free-to-play. This implies that it will exist as a standalone experience, like Call Of Duty: Warzone – an endlessly contracting and expanding skirmish that floats alongside the numbered sequels. It won’t just be an update for Battlefield 6 itself, which explains why it’s absent from the latter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">Season 1 DLC plans</a>. Still, I’m getting ahead of myself.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing else to share right now, beyond pointing you toward EA’s placeholder for the full gameplay trailer tomorrow. It seems likely the publishers’ hands have been forced by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online">rumours this weekend</a> - the people who outed it as REDSEC also claim that it'll launch on 28th October.</p>

<p>Last week, dataminers also discovered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/either-battlefield-6s-battle-royale-mode-will-release-next-week-or-theyre-adding-granite-or-something-called-granite">a mysterious piece of forthcoming content called “Granite”</a> on the EA app, rumoured to be the new Battlefield's battle royale functionality. I am defiantly clinging to the hope that this is a literal addition to the game's building materials that will absolutely ruin the lives of tank drivers.
</p><p>
All this comes as EA make tweaks to Battlefield 6’s progression system, handling and arsenal – recent measures include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">cracking down on attempts</a> to farm the bots in custom modes for easy XP. In hindsight, I wonder how much of that tweaking was carried out with a view to preparing the ground for REDSEC – even if the latter can be played separately, there will surely be a lot of crossover with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer component. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the game takes heavy inspiration from Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, EA’s flagship battle royale – the current head of Battlefield Studios is Vince Zampella, Respawn co-founder.
</p>
<p>
Again, I’m speculating. And why should I speculate, when some of you lurking bastards have been playing REDSEC in playtests? I know because you keep popping up in the comments on Battlefield 6 articles to waggle your eyebrows and hum innocently. Come on, break your NDA. I won't tell anyone. Nobody from EA reads this site anyway. There's a nice banana in it for you if you spill the beans.
