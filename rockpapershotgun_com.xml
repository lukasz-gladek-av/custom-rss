            <p>We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mochi-os-hamster-warfare-is-a-sweet-swift-sugar-rush">weaponising hamsters</a> and grizzling about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> with a word from the world of film – a film being a curious subspecies of video game that plays itself, consists partly of human souls preserved in gelatin and silver halide, and can only be ‘failed’ by skipping the post-credits scene. Whatever will the mad labcoats dream up next?</p>
<p>More specifically, it’s time for an insight from Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. He thinks the <a href="https://www.redsharknews.com/advancements-like-unreal-engine-5-could-mean-were-at-a-tipping-point-for-filmmaking">much-gobflapped</a> adoption of Epic’s Unreal Engine by visual effect teams is a blight upon the face of Hollywood. He thinks it’s an insult to the dignity of helicopters. OK, he doesn’t go quite that hard.</p><!--more-->
<p>Verbinski is currently doing interviews to promote Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – a sci-fi movie about Sam Rockwell returning from the future to warn of the perils of AI, which was itself very firmly made without using generative AI.</p>

<p>Asked by <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">But Why Tho</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/director-gore-verbinski-says-unreal-engine-is-the-greatest-slip-backwards-for-movie-cgi/">PCGamer</a>) to discuss the state of VFX, based on his long career of making galleons explode, Verbinski observed that “the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape. So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.”</p>
<p>I am immediately fascinated to learn what Verbinski means by a “gaming aesthetic”. All too often, interview answers tail off at this stage. Thankfully, Verbinski kept going.</p>
<p>“I think that’s why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you’ve got this different aesthetic,” he said. “It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you’re in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn’t work from a strictly photo-real standpoint.</p><p>“I just don’t think it takes light the same way; I don’t think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface, scattering, and how light hits skin and reflects in the same way. So that’s how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand.”</p>
<p>Verbinski has seen this transition play out over the course of a trilogy – as he commented, “in the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat.” I imagine Peter Jackson has similar feelings about the shift in CGI technology over the course of his Tolkien adaptations – there are few sights sadder than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2fq8tq/at_one_point_during_filming_of_the_hobbit_sir_ian/">Gandalf in a greenroom</a>. </p>
<p>Verbinski noted that many movie studio executives are absolutely fine with this, because they creatures of Money who don't care what real boats look like, but he himself regards the wider adoption of Unreal Engine by movie-makers as a regression. “I think in Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die, we try to be really strict with making at least 50% of the frame photographic,” he said. “I think that keeps you honest. You can use props as a reference, and when you see the CG replacement, you know how to replicate the real thing.</p>
<p>“I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya">Maya</a> as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards,” Verbinski continued. “And there’s also something, a mistake I think people make all the time on visual effects. You can make a very real helicopter. But as soon as it flies wrong, your brain knows it’s not real. It has to earn every turn; it has to move right. It’s still animation, sometimes it’s not just the lighting and the photography, sometimes it’s the motion.”</p>
<p>Old man yells at cloud, no doubt, but still, what do you think? In which Unreal Engine-based films do you detect at gaming aesthetic, whatever that means?</p>

            <p>Last week, EA followed through on plans outlined in 2025 by shutting down the servers of Bioware's Anthem. Pretty much since the shooter's fate was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">set in stone</a>, there's been the natural chatter about whether it could potentially be kept online or revived down the road in some fashion. At this early stage, there's been no huge re-emergence, but that doesn't mean folks aren't experimenting to see what such a thing might involve.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-revival-private-servers-shutdown-bioware-fan-2000661358">Kotaku</a>, a YouTuber going by And799 has posted a video of them getting the game up and running with two accounts serving as players in the same session. Seems like the majority of the player data [is] handled through Bioware's server instead of blaze and it is required for the game to be able to load offline," they observed in the video's description.</p>

<p>Now, before you get too excited, they also made sure to stress that "this is just a POC from my research and experiment and does NOT represent the current progress of the private server/revival project that is currently in progress." Adding to that, the video being posted on the Anthem subreddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfng76/anthem_client_as_server_testing_youtube/">attracted a comment</a> from a user who claims to be working with And799. "This is still a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit," this user added. "A lot of stuff clearly doesn't work as 'intended', and definitely needs at minimum, more polish."</p><p>That certainly mashes with the walls of code and text open in various windows over the course of the five-minute demo clip. So, any revival of Anthem still looks to be a ways off at current, with a project dubbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1pb8b3v/cenotaph_an_anthem_revival_project/">Cenotaph</a> whose creators previously posted about taking on that task having not updated their <a href="https://discord.gg/FwrJEJ7yMs">Discord server</a> to say anything beyond 'this is an idea we'd like to get the ball rolling on at some point' at this point.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed happening as I've taken a look around the Anthemsphere is that today, January 21st, the moderation team of r/anthemthegame have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qiwule/ranthemthegame_will_move_to_readonly_on_january/">posted plans</a> to archive the 33,000 user subreddit by making it read-only as of January 31st. "After that date, no new posts or comments can be made, but the subreddit and everything shared here will remain visible as an archive," they wrote. "We wanted to give everyone a clear heads-up ahead of time, in case you want to wrap up ongoing discussions, share a final farewell or reflection, or revisit and comment on old threads, screenshots, stories and memories. You still have about 9–10 days to do so."</p>
<p>There were quickly a couple of comments asking if it'd be possible to hold out a bit longer before taking this step, just in case efforts like And799's do yield progress towards a private server-based revival down the line. The subreddit's team have just responded to those by switching up their plans, which they say are "the result of long-term burnout and the reality that there has effectively been no active full mod team for years".</p>
<p>"It's very clear from the responses here that many of you still want this subreddit to remain a place for discussion, sharing projects, memories and potential future developments...and knowing that, it's not something that's going to be ignored," a fresh sticked comment from one of the moderators reads. "Because of that, we're pausing and rethinking the approach. If this community is going to continue, it needs solid volunteers who are genuinely willing to take on ongoing moderation responsibilities so the sub can be maintained at a level it deserves." They're encouraging folks who might fit that bill to reach out to them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modmail">via modmail</a>.</p><p>While it likely goes beyond what's achievable by a fan-run private server project without significant backing, long-time Bioware key cog Mark Darrah recently shared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-could-be-revived-as-a-trad-bioware-singleplayer-rpg-for-10-million-says-former-dragon-age-producer">his own vision for keeping Anthem going</a> as an RPG folks could try single-player, in addition to playing via local servers.</p>

If you find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> too dark, perhaps you will like I Hate This Place, an isometric (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9fm7ej/why_is_everyone_mentioning_isometric_when_they/">is it, tho?</a>) survival horror based on the comic book of the same name from  Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin. I Hate This Place is dark – it has hungry tentacle nests, antlered stalkers, and spiders of many sizes – but going by the trailer, at least, it’s nothing like as harrowing and hollowing as the Acid Wizard game. The colours are bright and splashy, the munsters, funky: think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>.
</p>
<p>
It occurs to me that we need a thematic darkness scale for ‘dark’ video games, perhaps comparable to ocean depth categorisation. I’d say Darkwood is right down there in the hadopelagic trenches. I Hate This Place? A denizen of the upper bathypelagic (Midnight) zone, so far. Here's that trailer.

In I Hate This Place – which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">a demo on Steam</a> – you play Elena, a grumpy teenage girl exploring the forests, bunkers and derelict townships of a “cursed land”. There’s a day-night cycle: when the sun is up, you explore, find resources and blueprints, craft gear, and set up shelters. When the sun is down, you try not to die. 
</p><p>
The game’s humanoid mutants are blind, following the sound of your footsteps. As for the spiders, they range from swarms of baby arachnids in eggs to giant jumping varieties that pose as rocks. There’s also the requisite spider queen, who can tangle you in webs and impale you. All of these badniks are vulnerable to bullets, but I imagine it’s wiser to avoid them, for the most part.

What is Elena’s motivation, besides not getting squelched by a centaur or devoured by a tarantula? She is a chasing the spectre of the Horned Man. That'll be the dude who keeps doing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>-style cinematic stings at her while she's rifling through cupboards, I expect. She also has a missing mother. This seems like a foundation for psychodrama, though I’m not expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> levels of soap opera, going by the trailer. Elena sounds quite indifferent, for a girl at permanent risk of being skewered or torn in half. I'm not convinced she really <em>does</em> hate this place.

Anyway, the game is out remarkably soon - 29th January, in fact. The devs recently did a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorGaming/comments/1po8r8w/we_are_the_developers_behind_i_hate_this_place/">Reddit AMA</a> if you want to hear more about difficulty modes, ammo scarcity and so forth.
