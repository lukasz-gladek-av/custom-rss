        <p>Will join new company founded by Arc Games bosses</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Embracer Group's undoing of their catastrophic multiple-year acquisition spree continues with the sale of Cryptic Studios and Arc Games, respectively the developers and publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-online">Star Trek Online</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a>.</p>
<p>The companies will become part of Project Golden Arc, a new outfit owned and led by members of the Arc Games management team, with $30 million of funding supplied by Chinese publishers XD Inc. As part of the sale, Embracer will keep hold of publishing rights for the previously Arc-published Remnant looter-shooters from Gunfire Games. </p>
<p>I'm happy that the MMO adepts of Cryptic - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-trek-online-and-neverwinter-mmo-devs-cryptic-are-the-next-embracer-owned-studio-to-suffer-layoffs">laid off staff</a> during Embracer's self-inflicted debt crisis in 2023 - are striking out for new pastures. We were quite keen on Star Trek Online, with CJ Wheeler (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-star-trek-online">noting</a> that "the game wraps itself fully in the design language of Star Trek, from the style of designer Michael Okuda's 'okudagrams' for elements of the menus to the familiar ships you can take to maximum warp". </p>
<p>As for Neverwinter, John Walker (RPS in peace) did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/impressions-neverwinter">a whole diary series</a> on it back in 2013, calling it "enormous, jam-packed with so very much to do, extremely approachable, but elaborately complicated if you want it to be". And then there's the defunct but warmly remembered crime-buster caping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/champions-online">Champions Online</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/city-of-heroes">City of Heroes</a>. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how many of the people who made those games remain at Cryptic, admittedly. Their most recent game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magic-legends">Magic: Legends</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/magic-legends-is-closing-down-six-months-after-entering-open-beta">shut down</a> before completion of the open beta.</p>
<p>Arc, meanwhile, are the former North American branch of the Chinese company Perfect World, initially created to localise the latter's games. They're also the publishers of Runic's Torchlight games and Heart Machine's Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>Arc and Cryptic were acquired by Embracer in 2021. As part of this week's sale, the rights for Arc's recently published multiplayer game Fellowship will be transferred to Embracer's subsidiary Coffee Stain, which will be <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/">spun off</a> "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers by the end of calendar year 2025".</p><p>After two years of mass layoffs, studio closures and cancellations, Embracer Group's affairs are perhaps a little more stable but still notably debt-ridden and, well, wriggly. It's like watching a beached octopus decide which limbs it can flog to passing seagulls in return for being dragged closer to the sea. </p>
<p>They're in the process of splitting into several separate companies, approximately divided between board gaming, video gaming and The Lord Of The Rings. They sold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-borderlands-devs-gearbox-to-rockstar-parent-take-two-for-460-million-in-shares">Gearbox to Take-Two Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">Saber Interactive to Beacon</a> in March 2024, but still retain possession of many notable developers including Fishlabs, Tarsier, Warhorse Studios, and Eidos-Montréal (who cut <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">75 staff</a> in April) across their various subsidiaries.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> devs Digital Extremes have launched <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/shop/founders">a Founders program</a> for their faded dark fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>. This means that you can now pay to get access to the work-in-progress game, rather than signing up for a chance of a free code. What’s more, you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095380/Soulframe/">wishlist it on Steam</a> ahead of the eventual final release, inasmuch as a steadily updated gameworld like this ever reaches completion. There are always more layers to the setting, and more rad shoulderpads to unearth from the depths.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The purchase includes one or all of three "Wyld" characters, each with different weapons, skills and gear, or as Digital Extremes would have it “unique Pacts, Armour, Weapons, Sidearms, Figments, Spirit Guide Sparrow skins, Talismans, and Motifs of the Wylds.” There is a lot of this mildly confounding flavour text in Soulframe. Some of it exists for love of a fairytale; some of it is designed to magnify the lure of various craftables, currencies (including Arcs, bought with real cash) and other microtransactables. I’m not sure I’d call the Founders packs “micro”. They cost $39.99 or £24.99 apiece, or $129.99/£84.99 if you buy all three as part of the bumper Paragon pack.

<p>
I remain keen on Soulframe, based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe">the few hours I played around a year ago</a>. It has a tense and mournful overworld full of exquisite metals, textiles and masonry, with commendably Moria-ish procedural dungeons beneath. It has characters who spend the hours and days between sign-ins snoozing among woodland animals.</p><p>It has a sturdy and balletic third-person combat system with some ornate special moves that channel the decade Digital Extremes have spent crafting ever-fancier playstyles for Warframe. It has a parallel Nightfold tent city dimension you can fall backwards into as though cosying up to a big, floofy dog at the end of a busy day’s spent *checks notes* gathering Moonsteel Threads to Bestitch your equipment. (There is, in fact, a big floofy dog in the Nightfold.)
</p>
<p>
I do quite like aspects of the backstory writing, which angles for the same gnomic intensity and byzantine cast relationships you’d find in the Souls series… then cakes it all up to the point that my eyes grow tired, and my brain fills with the squeaking of a million wheel-bound hamsters. The basic problem is that it’s a free-to-play sim powered by updates, and as in Destiny, this entails a relentless fusillade of world-building. They call it "Soulslite" but there's nothing light about the lore. Much of this lives on the official website and social feeds. Wade through sign-up with gaze averted, and you may be surprised by the quietness of the gameworld beneath.
</p>
<p>
The Soulframe founder packs accompany the twelfth major “prelude” or pre-alpha update. Given the above complaints, the most important thing it introduces is probably an expanded and retuned new player experience, which lets you try out starting characters before committing to a pact. It also adds the ability to fast travel between World Trees using Wevetseeds, new boss spawning patterns, a mushroom you can eat to trigger a harrowing “Cogah” world shift for special rewards, a new Greatsword weapon, and a camel merchant for the Nightfold tent dimension. The camel has an eyeball attached to their beard. There will be an explanation for this and it will be exasperating.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has been listed for PC, bringing closer the moment in which you and I can learn why exactly Troy Baker is a glam rocker, why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> director George Miller (it's not actually him) has a cat demon, and why Turkish-German screenwriter Fatih Akin has become a living doll. Sony have yet to announce the PC version of Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> courier fantasy or give it a release date, but the Entertainment Software Rating Board have <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">a page up now</a>. Go on, Sony - call them liar liar, pants on fire.
</p>
<p>Which leads us neatly into the detail of said ESRB ratings page - it warns that you will encounter "a man set on fire in a fantastical manner" in Death Stranding 2. Possibly the man was being deceitful? A social stealth game featuring self-combustion would be neat, actually, and is absolutely the kind of brilliant garbage Kojima would develop. The ESRB further caution that "the word 'f**k' is heard in the game." Well, that's me out. I was already iffy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">the flagrant Snake bait</a>. I don't want to hear not-George Miller swear.
</p>
<p>I found the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a mixture of unbearable and fascinating, with the balance shifting towards fascinating as I revisited the game after review and made connections between its portering and path-beating mechanics and my own experiences of getting horribly lost in the vicinity of Kettlewell. It was also one of RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-games-of-2020">favourite games of 2020</a>, with Katharine (RPS in peace) calling it "a walking simulator in the very best sense of the word".
</p>
<p>The sequel remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. There's still time for a surprise end-of-year release. Come to think of it, isn't there some big industry awards show round the corner in December? In other news, Hideo Kojima has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people">learned so many ways to kill people</a> and we really should hurry up and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">send him to outer space</a>.</p>
