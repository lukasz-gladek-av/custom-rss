Do you… do you hear that? Can you feel it? That disgusting, gnawing feeling, a shiver down your spine because you know it's coming for you… the Steam summer sale… Friends, Romans, country(insert pronoun here), it is unfortunately that time of year again, that time where you look at all of those games in your wishlist as you try to figure out which deal is the best, and which to leave for the next inevitable sale.

Personally, there are far too many games in my wishlist that I'd like to buy now but I am also supposedly an Adult with Responsibilities, so I will try to refrain from picking anything up. Besides, that backlog isn't getting any shorter and my lifespan isn't getting any longer. Still! The mortifying concept of ego and literal death aside, I'm still going to make mention of a few notable games that have some healthy discounts, if only to make you think "oh yeah I've been meaning to play that."

For starters, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Death Stranding is 60% off</a> making it only £14, and considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s inevitable PC release is nowhere in sight, you might as well relieve some of that FOMO. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/">Elden Ring is quite a healthy 40% off</a> at £30, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/">so is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, making it £39</a>. Possible future GOTY and frequent discourse starter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a smaller discount of 10% off</a>, but that still makes it £38. Last year's actual GOTY <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/">UFO 50 is also only £16.80</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really want something cheap as chips, the groovy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer is as low as £1.27</a>. Heavily lesbian visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/">Heaven Will Be Mine is only £2.27 as well</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/">Robocop: Rogue City is £4.49</a>.
</p>
<p>
Point is, there's too many damn games that are really cheap right now. I'm sure you'll figure out your budget somehow.
