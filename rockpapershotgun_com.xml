            <p>Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition, an upgraded, 64-bit version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">your 29th favourite strategy game of all time</a>, which includes all of the original expansions and will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods".</p>
<p>The developers assert that "this is the iconic Dawn of War as players remember it, but optimized for modern hardware." Nonsense, Relic! In order for this to be Dawn Of War as <em>I</em> remember it, I would need to play it while subsisting entirely on cans of 20p Tesco tomato soup. Nowadays Tesco tomato soup costs 65p a can. It turns out that in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only rampant inflation. And 4K graphics. Here's the announcement trailer.</p>

<p>The Definitive Edition features four Dawn of War campaigns, encompassing nine armies and over 200 maps. You can expect upscaled textures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">image-based lighting</a>, together with an optimised HUD layout for widescreen displays and an "improved" camera. "World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting will faithfully enhance the moment-to-moment action," gushes the press release.</p>
<p>Back in February, a few months after Sega sold them to UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP, Relic unveiled plans for a fiendishly diversified mix of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-devs-relic-bounce-back-with-plans-for-big-rts-sequels-smaller-experiments-and-spiritual-revivals">big RTS sequels, smaller experiments and spiritual revivals</a>. Happy as I am that they're still in the Spice Maureen business, this does feel like a quick cash-in while they work on something brand-new. If you don't care for those Definitive technical flourishes, you can already find a Dawn Of War compendium on Steam in the shape of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4570/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Anniversary_Edition/">Anniversary Edition</a>, which also features all the old expansions and is currently 80% off till 29th May.</p>
<p>All this confirms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-skulls-returns-amidst-dawn-of-war-4-rumours">Nic's report</a> from earlier this week that "something Dawn Of War shaped" would turf up at this year's Warhammer Skulls event. Nic is our premier Games Workshop astropath and archivist. He knows his Great Knarlocs like I know yearly increases in the price of canned goods. Let us gather trustingly around his arcane relay in the hopes that he absently murmurs the words "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters">Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</a> sequel".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ever find yourself thinking, "man, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was a good video game, it sure would be swell if they made another one of those"? If so, the headline already spoiled this for you, but I'm going to pretend like it hasn't: a sequel was just revealed at the Warhammer Skulls Showcase! The reveal trailer mostly shows off what looks like more of the first game, but with boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">shooters</a> that look this good, I think that's just fine.
</p>

Right now, the game is currently slated for a 2026 release, with no more specific a window than that. I'm sure it'll be nowhere near GTA 6, just like literally every other game next year. A press release explains that enemies like Nurglings and Chaos Cultists will be making a comeback alongside the introduction of new enemies like Bloodletters and Juggernauts. I'm sure this'll all mean a lot more to Warhammer 40K lore heads than it does to me, honestly there could be an enemy called Hellsuckers and I'd believe you.

<p>
On top of all that there'll be new weapons to pick up, locations to explore, and a storyline with different branches to head down, each with their own unique levels.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's actually another new Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun game you can play right now too, Words of Vengeance. This one's a "first person typer", so think games like The Typing of the Dead, but with a Warhammer 40,000 paintjob. Words of Vengeance looks silly as hell, and it's even completely free! Love that.
</p>
<p>
There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36406/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_Anniversary__Boltgun__Graia_Collection/">Steam bundle</a> with the original Boltgun, alongside the first Space Marine, that's 47% off at the moment if you've not played either of them before. You can also wishlist Boltgun 2 on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">right here</a>, and pickup Words of Vengeance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">here</a>.

            <p>Each army in Warhammer 40,000 has its own codex containing rules, lore, and nice pictures, and The Leagues Of Votann's - the game's contemporary space dwarves - was out of date before a single model was available to buy. Advance copies went out, people noticed that the rules were horribly broken, more people noticed that the rules were actually massively, horribly, absurdly broken, and the company issued an apology, pulling out their <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2CjuqDSg/leagues-of-votann-balance-update-a-word-from-james-workshop/">cutesy 'James Workshop' moniker</a> in an attempt to aw shucks the fact they'd just sold everyone some very expensive hardback kindling. They later issued some rules errata, and they're supposedly in a more sensible spot now, even if doing anything interesting with them visually is confined, as per, <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Grendl-Grendlsen-Squat-Bounty-Hunter-2018">to Necromunda</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to bet money on it, I'd guess they won't be nearly as broken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2</a> when they appear as potential allies or foes for both the Ad-mech and Necron playable factions. That's because difficulty balance was one of the major problems holding the original Mechanicus back from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> greatness (the game was later patched), so I imagine it being at the forefront of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> Studio's mind this time. Decide for yourself by observing the trailer below. How many busted tokens do these dwarves have in their beards?</p>

<p>If you skipped the first Mechanicus, it was notable for a couple of things: an absurdly entertaining action economy that let your late game popebots sweep maps without stopping for breath (do Ad-mech breathe?) and a soundtrack that felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU">pipe organ had gained sentience</a> and declared war on reality itself. It was, balance aside, a good time, and I'm interested to see what Bulwark have learned from their first outing.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the game's Steam page lists the release date as TBA, but the presser I received reckons it's out sometime this year. This may be old news by the time you're reading this, by which time hundreds of billions of cells in my body will have been replaced. A truly antiquated and wasteful biological system I wouldn't have to deal with if the machine god would simply bless my digusting, fallible flesh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
