<p>Here's a bit of story from the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>An endless rain of miasma hangs over a near-future Tokyo in the wake of an ancient enemyâ€™s resurrection. The fate of the city lies in the hands of young ninja prodigy, Yakumo. Fighting his way through cybernetic ninja soldiers and otherworldly creatures, Yakumo must reconcile a destiny he shares with the legendary Ryu Hayabusa himself and free Tokyo from the ancient curse that brought the city to its knees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-ninja-announce-ninja-gaiden-4-and-theyre-getting-help-from-platinum">announced earlier this year</a> as a joint effort by Team Ninja and Platinum - an unholy alliance in character action games that should perhaps be made illegal. It's not the only game of face-obscuring sneakery being developed. The retro-styled action platformer Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-the-trailer-for-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-from-koei-tecmo-dotemu-and-the-blasphemous-team">unveiled late last year</a>, with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> devs in charge. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-will-set-your-village-on-fire-as-is-only-proper">got to have bite</a> previously, and quite enjoyed what he played. That's also now got a release date of July 31st.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/high-on-life-2-comes-to-run-the-joke-further-into-the-ground-this-winter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>High On Life 2, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/justin-roiland-has-resigned-as-ceo-of-high-on-life-developer">former Rick And Morty actor Justin Roiland</a>'s Squanch games, is coming this Winter, as per tonight's Xbox showcase. The trailer looked heavily doctored despite the "in-game footage' claim, but it looks to be more of the same with the volume turned up: talking guns, aliens, weird abilities like a turtle with flamethrower breath, and the same two or three jokes stomped so far into the ground they end up melting in the glow of the earth's core.</p>

<p>Humour is, of course, subjective, but the main problem with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> is that is just wasn't a very good shooter. Those guns talked the talk, but the walk felt plinky and limp. Not ideal if you want to present something as more than just a gimmick.</p>
<p>All this said, the animation itself was pretty fantastic, making this one of the rare cases where a cinematic trailer is probably a fair indication of what to expect. I should also say that Squanch are no doubt full of talented and hardworking folk who bear no responsibility for Roiland himself. If this means moving on from his particular brand of anti-humour and making High On Life 2 their own, all the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
