            <p>Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">acquisition of Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. 
</p>
<p>Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-report-reveals-more-about-turbulent-development-including-forspoken-prompted-shift-from-snark-to-seriousness">famously</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-producer-posts-tell-all-video-about-the-messy-birth-of-ea-and-biowares-anthem">difficult</a> original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">$20 billion in debt </a>and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face.
</p>
<p>OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">smiling words</a> without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe."
</p>
<p>For context, the next Mass Effect game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-making-a-new-mass-effect">sort-of-announced in 2020</a>. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-tease-the-return-of-the-geth-in-the-next-mass-effect-game">the possible return of the Geth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy</a>, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">mass layoffs</a> in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-got-a-nice-pay-bump-last-year-while-the-companys-workers-earned-less-on-average">got himself a pay rise</a>. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive to speculate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">EA might sell BioWare or close them down</a>.
</p><p>"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."
</p>
<p>He also gave an update on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-amazon-make-a-mass-effect-tv-show-liara-should-be-the-main-character">the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show</a>, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout.
</p>
<p>"The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy.
</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".</p>

            <p>
Blizzard are adding a new premium virtual currency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> alongside player housing in the MMO's forthcoming Midnight expansion. It's called Hearthsteel, and is "purchased with real money using your Battle.net balance and used in turn to buy Housing items from the Battle.net shop and in-game shop," as detailed in a blog post this week. 
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736">comments</a> that the "vast majority" of housing items are and will continue to be earnable through play, with a "small fraction" sold for Hearthsteel. Even then, you'll be able to buy items sold for Hearthsteel using WoW Tokens derived from in-game gold. Housing items "tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop", and nor will "thematically important decor that players know and love". Hearthsteel is strictly for homey boondoggles: there are "no plans to use it for the Trading Post, mounts, transmogs, or pets".
</p>
<p>
All well and good. But Blizzard's reasons for adding a new premium currency to a game that was rubbing along well enough without seem sketchy.
</p>
<p>
As the developers themselves put it in that blog post, "why bother when we already have a Battle.net balance?" They justify the introduction of Hearthsteel by noting firstly that "when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties". To which I can only say: show your working, Blizzard, because I have no idea what you're referring to.
</p><p>
The developers add that buying things with real money "can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items", giving the example of buying a full set of chairs, candles and a dining table for a banquet. They argue that "using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient".
</p>
<p>
I'm... not really seeing it, and neither are the Wowsers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq6li7/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzards-reason-for-adding-premium-currency-to-world-of-warcraft-after-21-years-of-doing-just-fine-without-one-has-everyone-worried-about-player-housing/">PCGamer</a>). As one user points out, why not just let players put multiple purchases into a shopping cart rather than rolling out some newfangly Azeroth doubloons?</p>
<p>It seems likely that the real rationale for Hearthsteel is the same rationale that informs purchaseable virtual currencies at large: they cloud how much you're actually spending in real money terms, and often wangle you into spending too much by flogging the virtual currency in set amounts, rather than letting you buy exactly as much as you need. The addition of housing to WOW Midnight is sure to inspire a microtransaction boom - I guess this is just Blizzard adding a little more grease to the chute.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a consumer advocacy group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-european-consumer-watchdog-wants-you-to-be-able-to-buy-exactly-as-much-in-game-currency-as-you-need-not-fixed-chunks">called upon the European parliament to end such predatory practices in videogames</a>, but a huge number of publishers rely upon virtual currencies, especially in the realm of free-to-play. Time to bang that drum again, while you agonise over the interior of your Razorwind Shore chalet.
