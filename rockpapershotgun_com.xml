Right, sorry parents that proudly put their kids' borderline impressionist drawings on the fridge, there's a new bare minimum you have to meet. If you're not turning your child's drawings into full on video games, then I'm sorry to say you're not doing a good enough job. This doesn't apply to Artur Latkovsky, though, who is quite literally doing that with his game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/odd-dorable">Odd Dorable</a> (I'm sure I don't need to explain the name to you), a game where every single bit of art in the game was made by his four-year-old daughter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, here's the thing: the art is very obviously something drawn by a four-year-old. You're not going to boot Odd Dorable up and think "wow, she's only four and she drew this?" It so clearly was! And yet, it is immediately, infinitely charming because it is raw, unfiltered art made by someone that doesn't have any preconceived notions of, well, presumably just about most things.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1kee9op/i_am_working_on_a_game_made_from_my_daughters/">I am working on a game made from my daughterâ€™s drawings</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acem13/">u/acem13</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/">indiegames</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Latkovsky describes it as an "open-world exploration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game" where you have to help a princess find all her lost candies. I can't quite tell you what those puzzles will be like, details are pretty light, but given the involvement of a literal child in the developmental process, I'm going to assume they're not going to be all that complicated. 
</p>
<p>
The real hook here is the improvisational nature of it all. Latkovsky explained in a Reddit post that he even tries to get art drawn by his daughter on concrete into the game. Another example is that his daughter drew a dinosaur with fairy wings who is guarding a space rocket, so of course that gets added in. I mean, isn't this every child's dream? To tell someone all of the ridiculous ideas you have and they make them real? Good stuff, even if the kid is technically being paid in candies according to Latkovsky.
</p>
<p>
It'll also be quite a short game, capping out at around an hour, purposefully designed to be "digestible", so don't expect too much from it when it apparently arrives in September this year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690890/Odd_Dorable/">here</a> if you're as charmed as I am.

Horror asymmetric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary later this year, an amount of time so large it really makes you think "man, most live service devs should have had the foresight to make their game a decade ago, huh?" With that anniversary approaching imminently, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/behaviour-interactive">Behaviour Interactive</a> held a year nine anniversary broadcast where there was one reveal that'll have you going "yeah that makes sense" and another where you'll say "ok, sure."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The first one is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> villain Springtrap is coming to the game as a new killer, an addition that feels so obvious I'm not sure why it's taken this long. It seems like they're taking some cues from the movie for this one, as Matthew Lillard is actually reprising his role as the character from the film adaptation. Details like Springtrap's moveset and a release date are being withheld for an incoming livestream, but there's a legendary outfit planned alongside the Yellow Rabbit version from the film. Oh, and of course there'll be a map based on the Freddy Fazbear's restaurant too.

Here's the weird one: it's another collaboration, this time with The Witcher of all series. No, you won't be running around as Geralt or anything, it's coming in the form of a few costumes. Survivor Vittorio Toscano is getting an outfit based on Geralt's, with other outfits planned based on characters like Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. This one's just a bit odd! The Witcher games aren't horror, so it just feels a bit like suits swinging around properties they own just because they can.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, a few other updates are planned throughout the rest of the year, with June seeing a rework of The Archives and adjusted gamma settings, alongside other updates further down the line allowing for more spectators in custom matches, rebalancing for map and key items, and a few other bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new chapter coming in 2026 where you (yes, even you) will be able to take part in a choose-your-own-adventure style activity to vote on different aspects of a new killer and survivor. TLDR: Lots on the way!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a> is still trudging along, it seems, as yesterday publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> announced that a new expansion is on the way, Alloyed Collective. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/524216645064853111?l=english">post over on Steam</a>, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> team explained that alongside updating the game's previous bit of DLC, Seekers of the Storm, they've brought on some "additional folks that are familiar with Risk of Rain to help us build out the next DLC." Alloyed Collective is apparently still a while away from being ready, but it sounds pretty jam packed.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one brings in six completely new stages, which range from "cliffside scrapyards to machinery-choked fortresses and buried caverns" in Solus-controlled territory. Two survivors are being added in, one a returning one (presumably from the first game), the other being fresh meat, though details are slim on both. You'll be able to take control over seven new drones, with a new station allowing you to modify them to your own needs. There's seven new enemy types too, lots of sevens! And one 15, as there'll be 15 new items to find as well.
</p>

<p>
With the world being as it is economically, it's also worth noting that if you've got a group of people you like to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> with, only one of you needs to buy Alloyed Collective to play with the new stages, items, and monsters. They just won't have access to the new survivors, or be able to permanently unlock new items or logbooks.
</p>
<p>
Seekers of the Storm wasn't exactly well-received at launch due to there being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">whole bunch of bugs</a> that made the game quite unplayable. Fingers crossed we don't see a repeat of that! Hopefully with new team members being brought on board and no release date in sight means the devs are able to get this bit of DLC out more comfortably.

        <p>Dean Hall claims the data used to support Unity's claim is "bogus"</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a> creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dean-hall">Dean Hall</a> is alleging that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/unity">Unity</a> are threatening to revoke all licenses for workers at his current studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/rocketwerkz">Rocketwerkz</a>, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a>. The developer made this claim in a lengthy post on Reddit saying that Unity are doing based on "bogus data about private versus public licenses." Hall shared what he claims is an email from Unity dated May 9th where they explained that the Unity Compliance Team has flagged Rocketwerkz's account as according to their data, the developer "currently [has] users using Unity Personal licenses when they should under the umbrella of your Unity Pro subscription."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Hall, when they asked Unity for more details, the evidence they provided included five email addresses that have supposedly "been logging in with Personal Edition licenses." Hall then noted that two of these email addresses had @rocketwerkz addresses, one being an employee who uses Unity Personal but does not work on a Unity project at the studio, the other being an external contractor who was provided a Pro licence at the time of their work.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kiyh0m/unity_is_threatening_to_revoke_all_licenses_for/">Unity is threatening to revoke all licenses for developers with flawed data that appears to be scraped from personal data</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thedeanhall/">u/thedeanhall</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">gamedev</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
The third was supposedly a personal email address of an employee, who Hall also says is provided with a Pro license, but the Rocketwerkz CEO says the second two were obscured email domains of employees at a separate company in Dunedin, New Zealand, neither of which have worked for Hall's company. Hall notes that Dunedin is where Rocketwerkz is based. 
</p>
<p>
If what Hall is saying is to be believed, it's likely that this is the reason employee emails from another company have been provided as evidence. However, that would obviously raise some questions as to how this happened in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Unity do not appear to have offered an official statement on the situation at this point in time, but I've reached out for comment.
