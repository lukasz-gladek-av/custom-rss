If you've been playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> and thinking, ah, this could really benefit from having approximately 16.7 million fewer colours and a couple more homicidal husks in diving suits, may I usher you wincingly towards Repose. It's a moodalicious, monochrome dungeon-crawler in which you get 50 in-game steps to search hideously dishevelled techno-crypts for oxygen cylinders, before you die of exhaustion. More likely, you will die of getting shot by a zombie astronaut. Here's a trailer.

Like Blue Prince, Repose invites you to make use of a notepad. Unlike Blue Prince, this isn't because you'll be jotting down clues about winsome dartboard puzzles. It's because the game doesn't have a save system. It has save codes, instead. Ah, save codes. Once a routine video game design convenience, now the province of the utter sadist. There are, at least, permanent progression elements such as doors you can unlock from the other side.
</p>
<p>
The grid-based format and 50-step limit might lull you into thinking that Repose is a turn-based game. It isn't. If you see a threat, you've got a second to either flinch away or belt it with your fireaxe. The axe is one of two starting possessions in the demo, which is still live on Steam. The other is a glowstick, which lends a gorgeously chiselled glimmer to your surroundings but also makes you visible from a whole 'nother tile away. Try not to equip it absent-mindedly. There are guns in the screenshots, but I've yet to acquire one.
</p>
<p>
The demo doesn't dig deep into the story, but what's here pongs of corpo-dread and existential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. The first location in the game is called Cafe Void - bet the coffee's good there. Your employer is simply The Company. There's a character who warns you not to sleep in any beds you encounter, which is not helpful in a game where you can only take 50 paces before keeling over. In the undeniably existential confines of my flat, 50 paces is good for... three, maybe four midnight toilet round-trips. My flat doesn't harbour any astronaut husks, mind. Not since the landlord put his foot down about couch surfers.
</p>
<p>
Repose launches today. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3002510/REPOSE/">Read more on Steam</a>. Alternatively, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a> - it has a similar vibe but is (so far) sexier and weirder and marginally less punitive, providing you accept that 'failing' your first run is desirable.

            <p>I cannot remember any of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>’s bosses, so it’s perhaps for the best that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach will let us skip right past them – skip right past them like children who think video games are just Instagram montages, and that the power of choice is a Christian rock band. Kojima Productions’ forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> off-Reeder will apparently give you the option to bypass bossfights after your defeat, with information about the character then fed to you in the form of image and text descriptions. In other words, Death Stranding 2 is secretly a hybrid visual novel.</p><!--more-->
<p>I jest, I jest! No visual novel would ever receive this kind of financing. They probably blew through the entire budget of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amarantus">Amarantus</a> on Troy Baker’s eyeshadow. Rest assured that Death Stranding 2 will have traditional real game accoutrements like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">shooting and cyberpunk pedalos</a>, but should you miss claiming a boss’s scalp by millimetres you will now have the option of delegating its defeat to the Game Over screen.</p>
<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," explains <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a> on Xitter, translating and summarising comments from game director Hideo Kojima during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-will-let-you-clear-bosses-without-actually-defeating-them">Eurogamer</a>. The bossfight and any story revelations therein will then be spelled out "like a novel".</p>
<p>What will the Kojima faithful make of all this? As Matt Jones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pillowfort.bsky.social/post/3lmrgnq4bec26">points out on Bluesky</a>, other developers have proposed to let players skip things and gotten it in the neck from people who regard ‘cheating’ at games as some kind of Nietzschean self-negation.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, for example, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat">received a torrent of abuse from disgruntled Dragon Age 2 players</a> over a recirculated interview from 2006, in which she argued that some games might benefit from the option to skip the combat. Something tells me that Kojima will be granted more latitude. Myself, I see no harm in letting Death Stranders skip bossfights as long as Death Stranding 2 doubles down on the hiking mechanics and lets me choose from a selection of bootlace knots to modify my stamina and agility. Also I want a pogo stick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
