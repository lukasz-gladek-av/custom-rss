            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s battle royale mode has a name, and it isn’t quite as awful as I was expecting, falling well short of the exhilarating cringe of "Battlefortnite". Battlefield REDSEC, they’re calling it. Such a Tom Clancelled, Limp Bizkit-ass moniker. What does REDSEC stand for, EA? Rampant Ennui Detected, Send Emergency Cookies? Or is it a game about hunting down commie office assistants? See, this is why they pay me the big bananas here at Rock Paper Shitpun Dot Com.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The more momentous news here is that REDSEC will be free-to-play. This implies that it will exist as a standalone experience, like Call Of Duty: Warzone – an endlessly contracting and expanding skirmish that floats alongside the numbered sequels. It won’t just be an update for Battlefield 6 itself, which explains why it’s absent from the latter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">Season 1 DLC plans</a>. Still, I’m getting ahead of myself.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing else to share right now, beyond pointing you toward EA’s placeholder for the full gameplay trailer tomorrow. It seems likely the publishers’ hands have been forced by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online">rumours this weekend</a> - the people who outed it as REDSEC also claim that it'll launch on 28th October.</p>

<p>Last week, dataminers also discovered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/either-battlefield-6s-battle-royale-mode-will-release-next-week-or-theyre-adding-granite-or-something-called-granite">a mysterious piece of forthcoming content called “Granite”</a> on the EA app, rumoured to be the new Battlefield's battle royale functionality. I am defiantly clinging to the hope that this is a literal addition to the game's building materials that will absolutely ruin the lives of tank drivers.
</p><p>
All this comes as EA make tweaks to Battlefield 6’s progression system, handling and arsenal – recent measures include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">cracking down on attempts</a> to farm the bots in custom modes for easy XP. In hindsight, I wonder how much of that tweaking was carried out with a view to preparing the ground for REDSEC – even if the latter can be played separately, there will surely be a lot of crossover with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer component. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the game takes heavy inspiration from Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, EA’s flagship battle royale – the current head of Battlefield Studios is Vince Zampella, Respawn co-founder.
</p>
<p>
Again, I’m speculating. And why should I speculate, when some of you lurking bastards have been playing REDSEC in playtests? I know because you keep popping up in the comments on Battlefield 6 articles to waggle your eyebrows and hum innocently. Come on, break your NDA. I won't tell anyone. Nobody from EA reads this site anyway. There's a nice banana in it for you if you spill the beans.

            <p>What happened today? Well, Astarion said something sassy, Lae'zel tried to teach Gale how to build a shed, and Shadowheart wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> of Shar-themed parody of 'Is This The Way To Amarillo'. That's about how I imagine the journal entries a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mod lets you write as part of an impressive in-game diary system will go.</p>
<p>Well, that and at least 100 words per day of moaning about having a little squid thing in your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/19332?tab=description">Tav's Journal</a> and has been developed by Mazzle23. It repurposes a clever tool they created for custom in-game mod instruction pages the other month, letting the player take simple quest logs and turn them into detailed diaries packed with entries in which you can document whatever you like. So, when you look back through the events of a playthrough, instead of Larian's default synopses, you'll have unique personal records of what you were doing or thinking at whatever point.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's aimed at the likes of those who get really deep into roleplaying or completionists who might be noting down details to return to, taking the sort of writing you might have done on a physical notepad up until now into the game itself.</p><p>Assuming you're in it to feel more in the shoes of your tadpole-brained adventurer, you can kick off as you would in physical DnD by filling out the character profile and biography section for your character. Mazzle23 boasts of "large text areas for detailed storytelling and notes", so feel free to go full War and Peace if you've time and a person in mind whose life thus far can't be summed up swiftly. Handily for more verbose narrative-weaving entries, the mod's diaries come with their own auto-save system and the ability to jump between editing and read-only modes.</p>
<p>They also include two kinds of to-do list, with the one for long-term goals mirroring the usual quest log, while the other provides for day-specific tasks "tied to particular journal entries" which I assume you'll set up yourself. 'Tell Gale he smells, then laugh when he cries' for instance.</p>
<p>The aesthetically-pilled will be glad to learn that the mod boasts some visual customisation too, with six page themes to pick from and multiple fonts, in case you can't feel truly at one with your dwarf unless you're scrawling across a stone tablet in Comic Sans. Any worries about having to ruin previous work in order to tailor a diary to a fresh playthrough have been planned for, with each character being able to create and maintain their own simultaneously, while you can also duplicate journals if you want templates or backup copies.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a really impressive thing to have pulled off, with Mazzle23 noting than an option to export journals as PDFs and auto-tracking for in-game stats are among the additions they're working on for future updates. If you fancy giving BG3 journaling a go, you'll need grab both the <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases">BG3 script extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18883?tab=description">Mazzle's EZ-Documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>
Is it bad that I find the office labyrinth of Pager rather cosy? Is it a sign that I have finally gone full 9-to-5 zombie? Or have I simply been mugged on Memory Lane by a composite of 90s aesthetics and technologies - pebbly Macintosh wallpaper patterns, mock-Bauhaus prints and yes, pagers, though I never owned one of those as a kid. 
</p>
<p>
I even like the background whine of the omnipresent CCTV cameras, which grows abruptly piercing as I walk beneath them. These are very much the wrong emotions for anything that bills itself as influenced by Kafka. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Kafka genre, I am sorry.

<p>
Created by the evidently self-deprecating bilge, and available in full now on <a href="https://bilgetbd.itch.io/pager/devlog/1095316/pager-full-version-is-out-now">Itch.io</a> with a browser demo, Pager is 60 floors worth of laidback 1-bit dread. You are some kind of office worker. Your boss sends you instructions via pager. The instructions tend to be things like "take this box to room 4". You go to room 4 and it's full of fish swimming by the light of distant stars. The next instruction is to jump three times. Pager does not have a jump button.
</p><p>
It's a gentle spoof of corporate ladder-climbing, a send-up of arbitrary and unknowable bosses and bureaucracies. It mixes humour with horror with a surprising sleepiness. There are a couple of soft jump-scares in the demo, but I was more unnerved by the crackling noise emitted by the butterfly you occasionally find perched on a coffee cup. Butterflies should not crackle. Still, even the butterflies can't wholly undermine the peace I glean from these mostly dark rooms full of dotcom memorabilia. Kafka aside, Pager's inspirations include Severance, Lynch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Serial Experiments Lain and Sonny Boy. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Lain-alike, I am sorry.
</p>
<p>
I'm not as bowled over by the demo (which includes the first 10 floors) as I thought I might be, after cooing over the screens. I think the scenarios could be longer, and perhaps wittier. They have a certain dad joke energy, at times - a touch of WarioWare minigame, but couched in a way that leads you to expect something more fiendish.</p>
<p>The developer comments on the Itch.io page that Pager "shouldn't give you any satisfaction", and do you know, I feel like I might ultimately be dissatisfied by a game that declines to give me any satisfaction. But perhaps it's a wind-up - the trailer includes a few scenarios that seem more elaborate and chilling, and the individual puzzles appear to follow a larger story. At the very least, I think it's worth you firing up the demo, especially if you think human art peaked with the launch of Kid Pix. Pager is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/">Steam</a>.
