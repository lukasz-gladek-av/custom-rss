            <p>
Last year, myself, Brendy and Graham  got fearfully excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, a bountiful free 1v1 FPS with map designs calibrated to nostalgiafuck anybody who ever played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> over an LAN or hoarded shareware CDs. Our fever burned all the hotter for knowing that Straftat is the work of them wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, the amazing Brutalist exploration game from 2022.
</p>
<p>
Brendy and Graham have now left the Treehouse, alas, so there is nobody here to get excited with me about VHOLUME, a first-person parkour game from one of the Straftat developers. I am sitting alone in my room, sorrowfully punching the air, tears pooling around my ankles and threatening to short-circuit the PC. Just as well it's a single player experience, I guess.

<p>
VHOLUME is the work of Léonard Lemaitre, the aforesaid Straftat dev, plus Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin, who I'm not familiar with. It's being published by IronEqual. The game casts you as Robert, a man galloping through "the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia", ruled by a tyrannical Ministry. He's on a mission to restore his family's revoked ration tickets. Quite what this has to do with parkour remains to be seen. It doesn't look like there are any other humans in the setting.
</p><p>
It's another dystopian Brutalist world of canted slabs, yawning concrete turbines, and slit windows stacked in such a way as to inspire massive trypophobia. In some of the screens, it looks like there's some liveable urban architecture. In others, it looks like a continuation of Straftat's abstract level mash-up ethos, with blocks jutting from mist.</p>
<p>The tech is less 90s than that of Straftat or Babbdi, with softer, diffuse lighting and shadows. I'm not sure which aesthetic I prefer. VHOLUME is a handsome beast, but it's sort of like they rubbed Straftat down with scented oils.
</p>
<p>
Expect "movement-centric gameplay where the player can jump, run, climb and slide with great freedom". True princes of parkour "can exploit momentum, discover shortcuts, and break the labyrinthine design, making each run a test of skill and efficiency as they chase target times."</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, and no trailer, but you can find some gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">Steam page</a>. I imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> fans who can live without the radiance of that game's City of Glass might enjoy this. As will people who relished last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p>

<p>"The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> Rally physics engine continues its evolution with the introduction of all-new Snow Physics and support for studded tyres," Supernova wrote in their <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-ea-0-2-out-now/">announcement</a> of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/514103843981624359?l=english">update 2.0</a>. "Rally drivers must now adapt to a dedicated layer of technical challenge, where control and precision are pushed to their absolute limits under low-grip conditions."</p>
<p>Despite that snow chat, there aren't any full snow stages in the game just yet, with this update instead bringing the Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit - an ice and snow track you can use to get some practice in via AC Rally's time attack and free practice modes. The other addition's a fresh car, the iconic Alpine A110 group 4 coupe, which won the Monte Carlo rally in 1973. It's an utterly beautiful blue machine, and I can't think of many better cars Supernova could have picked to look good as they slide past the snowbanks.</p><p>Anyway, my petrolheading aside, this update also brings a number of handy tweaks. "Based on new field research and validation from professional rally drivers, the gravel and tarmac physics and tyre models have been improved across the board," Supernova wrote. "The force feedback system also sees several fixes and refinements, including better consistency and improved behaviour under braking." The likes of general wheel support and car sound mixing have also gotten attention. Finally, there are 25 new events to give a go.</p>
<p>I'll definitely be making time to give AC Rally another extended go over Christmas, having not currently been back to see how I find it now Supernova have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3917090/view/803457048228397793?l=english">deployed a fix</a> for the Logitech G29 wheel-specific issues that marred <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-looks-the-part-as-it-heads-into-early-access-but-ive-found-its-driving-a-numb-struggle">my pre-release rallying</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione have announced that they’ve repaid all the money they borrowed to develop their Surrealist horror game Horses, despite being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">denied release on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ban-santa-ragiones-horses-just-before-release-with-a-weird-reminder-that-adult-only-nft-games-are-fine-though">the Epic Games Store</a>. It’s a better outcome than expected, given Steam’s centrality to PC gaming, and a strong demonstration of support for art that is prepared to disregard taboos and investigate something profoundly ugly. It’s also, however, not enough to keep Santa Ragione operational. </p>
<p>As warned when they broke their silence about the Steam ban last month, the developers are suspending operations and looking for other work. It’s possible they’ll get the band back together down the road, but this “will not be easy”.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses has sold 18,000 copies across all platforms since launch on GOG, Humble and Itch, generating around $65,000 in net revenue. Back in November, the developers told us that they had borrowed roughly $50,000 from friends to complete development, following the Steam ban, with the overall budget running to $100,000.</p>
<p>“After paying the royalties owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of HORSES, these proceeds will be sufficient to repay the loans we took to finish development,” reads a press release, sent to RPS last night. “We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved.</p><p>“At the same time, this result is not enough to begin production on a new game,” it continues. “The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.”</p>
<p>Steam rejected a work-in-progress version of Horses in June 2023. The platform holder’s reasons for doing so remain unclear, but according to a Valve statement circulated by Santa Ragione themselves, the platform holder’s reviewers were concerned about depictions of "sexual conduct involving a minor". The developers subsequently altered the game to make all the characters visibly over 20 years old. They have also argued that while Horses does contain portrayals of sexual abuse of many kinds, it does not seek to arouse or glorify.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">reviewed Horses</a>, and while I haven’t played and therefore can’t speak for the WIP build from June 2023, this absolutely isn’t a work of child pornography. It’s a story of sexual oppression and brutalisation, which considers censorship as a form of sadism. The violence it depicts is portrayed as being technologically mediated via both an in-game projector and various self-referential pieces of design. It very clearly isn’t intended to be received as ‘unfiltered’ representation and endorsement. To claim otherwise is to misunderstand the game or, worse, twist it out of context.</p>
<p>In this week’s statement about sales, Santa Ragione write that the Steam ban precipitated “a prolonged scramble for funding, with debt, opportunity cost, and team members taking other work”. In other words, the studio had already begun to fragment long before Santa Ragione went public about Valve’s decision.</p><p>The developers also note that while Horses has been a relative hit at launch, the game will miss out on the long-term revenue from Steam’s many sales and bundle offers. “Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles,” they write. “These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like.” </p>
<p>I’m interested to hear more about the key distribution situation. Santa Ragoine have previously criticised Valve for declining to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" featuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>, their previous well-regarded horror game.</p>
<p>The developers conclude by refocussing attention on Valve’s role as de facto industry regulator and censor, given the size of its share of the PC gaming market. They write that stronger-than-expected sales of Horses “should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. </p>
<p>“For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly,” the statement concludes.</p><p>To continue the theme from that closing sentence, the news that Steam had banned Horses came following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a wider crackdown on adult games</a> across both Valve’s platform and indie storefront Itch.io. This summer, Valve and Itch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">altered their</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">submission terms</a> to give international payment processing networks a say over the definition of acceptable adult material.</p>
<p>The payment networks themselves appear to have tightened their rules <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">under pressure</a> from anti-misogyny groups and anti-pornography activists with ultra-conservative leanings. There is a counter-campaign underway to force the payment networks to reverse policy, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.com/post/3m7gd2poyk22y">organised</a> by community figures such as journalist and Youtuber Ana Valens. We will likely have more reporting on the subject next year.</p>
