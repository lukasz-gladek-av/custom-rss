When you have a game that is so run focused like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, balance is the key to not getting someone to throw their controller at a wall, cursing their own birth as they do so. Up until now, there were parts of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> that certainly weren't balanced, though that mostly came down to a few bugs. As of today though, there's a new update you can download for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> which brings in some much needed fixes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, there's a big fix for Libra, Creature of Night. Previously, Libra could get stuck in a loop of doing the same attack over and over again (one worst case scenario seeing this occur a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4lm4r/72_consecutive_attacks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-update-aims-to-fix-one-nightlord-boss-tanking-your-framerate-the-other-from-going-berserk-and-mashing-you-into-paste-with-72-consecutive-attacks/">whopping 72 times</a>), but that's now been fixed. You'll also find that the game won't look as much like a slideshow when facing off against Adel, Baron of the Night anymore, as a bug that meant the game's stability wasn't so stable has now been fixed.
</p>
<p>
One fix I find personally funny is that there would occasionally be an issue where during the "Find the Demon Merchant in Limveld" personal objective, said Demon Merchant just shouldn't show up. That too has now been fixed, but I do love the idea of just being stood up by a Demon Merchant as you set about on your quest. Sad moody fanfic when?
</p>
<p>
Bow users will technically be in for a bit of a tougher time, as a bug that caused physical attack power to increase on bows when a passive magic, lightning, or holy effect was added to the weapon has now been fixed. There's a few other small fixes too, you can read about those on the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1012">official patch notes</a>. A small update overall to be sure, but one that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">paving the way for duos somewhere down the line</a>.

            <p>
Finding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P: Overture</a> a bit too hard? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you just "get good" like those randos you see littered all over Twitter. I'm actually here to say that you're not alone on this one. The story expansion for the conceptually weirdest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> in town dropped during Geoff's Onslaught Of Generally OK Announcements (aka, Summer Game Fest) as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-overture-gets-surprise-release-right-now-so-you-can-play-it-instead-of-staring-at-geoffs-awful-shoes">surprise release</a>, and it seems like the general feedback so far has been "please make it a bit easier so Twinkocchio doesn't get battered so hard."
</p>

<p>
In a Director's Letter shared earlier today from Jiwon Choi, the game director shared that the team has been reviewing all of the feedback they've received over the past few days and are "already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions." Specifically, they'll be paying "closest attention to the combat experience.

"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended. Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."
</p>
<p>
Probably worth noting that this letter didn't feature any kind of window as to when the patch might be coming. Choi explained that the video was more to let P-Heads (that's what I like to call Lies of P fans) know that changes will be coming somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p>
That previously announced update that includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-ps-upcoming-easy-difficulty-modes-have-wonderfully-unhelpful-names">new difficulty settings</a> arrived with the DLC too, allowing you to either make both it and the base game easier or harder. Feeling very thankful to have not seen any of the usual annoying discourse when it comes to such features in Soulslikes, but alas, there's always tomorrow.
