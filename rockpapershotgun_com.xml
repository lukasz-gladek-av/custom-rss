            <p>Sometimes our patron news deity the Maw opens beneath my feet like a toothy sinkhole, and sometimes it leaps up and slobbers all over my face like an exhilarated labradoodle after a weekend at the kennels.</p>
<p>Down boy! Down, you ridiculous creature! Stop putting your tentacles in my ear. Who wanna biscuit? Do you wanna biscuit? Well, you can't have a biscuit - the only things I have to offer are new PC games. Here's what's coming down the chute this week.</p><!--more-->

I can't remember what the rest of the RPS editorial team are up to this week because I spent the whole morning meeting dying for the loo. I believe there are reviews, guides, news and features in the works. My plans include some tentative follow-up necromancy. How about you?
