With trends and trendy games passing by these days, I'd understand if you'd already forgotten about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a>. I am not here to remind you of its existence to talk about it, more so use it as genre context for Dogpile, a new game that is essentially the question "what if Suika Game actually had a bunch of dogs and was also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder?" I know, I know, there are too many of those already, but this one's just so charming!
</p>
<p>
First of all, the entire thing is hand-drawn and animated. I feel like the best way I can describe the vibes of the aesthetic is that it looks like one of those fancy greetings cards in a boutique shop that costs more money than you're comfortable with, but it's for your aunt who you quite like and want to get a good chuckle out of her.

Instead of matching different types of fruit, here you must fuse various breeds of dogs together to create larger, equally funny looking dogs. They don't just come in circles either, there's all sorts of shapes adding one layer of tactical gameplay. You choose particular dogs to play from the cards you draw from your deck, but to mix things up all of these canines can have different positive and negative modifiers.
</p><p>
For example, there's a friendly modifier that essentially magnetises two matching dogs towards one another. On the other end, there's a crated modifier that means those dogs can't merge at all for a couple of rounds. Dogtags allow you to add in even more ways to mix up rounds, like one that turns every dog that's smaller than a pug into a pug.
</p>
<p>
To be honest I find Suika Game quite displeasing to look at, and ultimately there's only so much it can do. Dogpile, despite being yet another roguelike deckbuilder, looks like it might satisfy that itch I have for something more. And it's out right now! Today! At 30% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3839300/Dogpile/">Steam</a>! What more can you ask for?

            <p>
I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.
