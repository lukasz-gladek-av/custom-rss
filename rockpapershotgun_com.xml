            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> on PC has been updated with a new Enhanced version, bundling in a range of tune-ups such as ray-traced graphics and support for AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS, new features for GTA Online, and a heaping helping of swankmobiles for your fleet of GTA cars. Existing GTA 5 story mode and GTA Online progress will carry over, and it’s all free to people who own the old version of GTA 5, which is now known as the Legacy version on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s a nice overhaul with a few downsides. One is that the game’s system requirements have also been Enhanced - you'll need double the RAM and double the graphics card memory, amongst other things. You can still play the Legacy version if you don’t have the specs for the upgrade, but Legacy and Enhanced owners aren’t allowed to play together, which threatens to drive a bit of a wedge through the community.</p>
<p>The Enhanced version also adds “kernel-based anti-cheat protections”, which may not amuse those of you who prefer it when games don’t snoop on every application you have running from the stinking bowels of your computer, or have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">concerns</a> about the cheater-rumbler software throwing up false positives or exposing your system to ransomware. But the big forum complaint, right now, is that Rockstar appear to have done away with GTA 5’s in-game text chat - possibly because these Enhancements come via the previous "next gen" update for GTA 5 on PS5 and Xbox, which obviously have different kinds of chat functionality.
</p>
<p>
There are many threads about the absence of text chat on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3240220/discussions/0/592890771319858068/#c592890771319866010">Steam</a> and Reddit. Several people have posted what they claim are screenshots of conversations with Rockstar support. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3mxmt/as_it_turns_out_the_lack_of_chat_in_the_enhanced/">One of these alleged support messages</a> acknowledges that “in-game text chat is not supported in GTA V Enhanced currently”, which suggests it’ll be addressed via patch; in the meantime, it advises people to make use of the game’s SMS features or platform level chat features. I’ve approached Rockstar myself for comment.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like picking the straws from a bale of spun gold, but in-game text chat is a feature many have come to rely on. Perhaps you have disabilities that make text chat more convenient, or perhaps you’d like to exchange salutations with randos without speaking aloud and potentially revealing your gender.</p>
<p>More frivolously, somebody’s posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3zxwx/the_newbie_took_off_before_i_realized_that_ee_had/">a tragic communique</a> about innocently boarding a plane piloted by a brand new player, and realising they couldn’t communicate with each other. Hey, perhaps there's a Netflix miniseries in this. I'll send Vin Diesel a request for comment, too.
</p>
<p>
There are also a host of other complaints related to people struggling to migrate their progress between versions. While irritating, these seem more like the usual launch-day bugs.</p>
<p>Of course, the lion’s share of disgruntled responses to Rockstar’s social media posts about the update are from people pining for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer. The game remains slated for console launch later this year so it's definitely high time we had a video. Maybe even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">GTA 6 PC release date</a>, as a treat.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A long-running zombie MMORPG you can play in your internet browser is shutting down next week, after almost 20 years of plank-smashing and supermarket looting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urban-dead">Urban Dead</a> is closing down because a new UK law threatens hefty fines for online services (including games) that don't follow age restriction rules and other guidelines. It looks like making the game compliant with that law would be too much work for the solo web developer who's been keeping the apocalyptic servers going for this long. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Sad to have to announce that Urban Dead will be closing down on Friday 14 March 2025, due to an upcoming change in UK website legislation," said developer Kevan Davis in a <a href="https://www.urbandead.com/shutdown.html">post on the game's website</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cult-text-based-zombie-mmo-urban-dead-is-shutting-down-after-a-full-19-years-8-months-and-11-days-because-of-new-uk-legislation/">Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>"The Online Safety Act comes into force later this month, applying to all social and gaming websites where users interact, and especially those without strong age restrictions. With the possibility of heavy corporate-sized fines even for solo web projects like this one, I've reluctantly concluded that it doesn't look feasible for Urban Dead to be able to continue operating."</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act was passed into law in 2023 and comes into effect this year. The UK government says the act will make social media and search companies "more responsible for their users’ safety on their platforms."</p>
<p>"The strongest protections in the Act have been designed for children," an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">explainer says</a>. "Platforms will be required to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content."</p>
<p>But the law has been criticised as a censor's charter by human rights groups <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/online-safety-bill-a-threat-to-human-rights-warn-campaigners/">such as Open Rights</a>, and big companies like Apple have complained that it has <a href="https://www.24zero.net/apple-calls-uks-online-safety-bill-a-serious-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption/">repercussions for end-to-end encryption</a>. This is a bit messy, since Apple is already in a spat with the UK government over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">a secret order</a> they were handed by the government to hand over the keys to their encryption - but, look, none of this has anything to do with zombies. Urban Dead just seems to be collateral damage in a bigger legal brawl between the UK government and corporate interests.</p>
<p>"So a full 19 years, 8 months and 11 days after its quarantine began, Urban Dead will be shut down. No grand finale. No final catastrophe. No helicopter evac. Make your peace or your final stand in whichever part of Malton you called home, and the game will be switched off at noon UTC on 14 March."</p>
<p>Malton is the name of the big city you explore in the game. It's basically loads of blocks full of gun shops, fire stations, hospitals, malls, pubs, and other potential sources of useful items to scavenge. You can board up the windows of any building to protect against the undead. It's the only MMO I know that lets players play as zombies. I briefly wrote about waking up as a zombie and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-urban-dead">enjoying the game's refresh battles</a> back in 2017. I haven't played for many many years, but my fond memories of the game include holding out in a boarded up mall with lots of other players (and a single "pet" zombie player who muffled and groaned in <a href="https://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Guides:The_Zombie_Lexicon">a whole language that you could actually translate</a> if you took the time to examine the moans). </p>
<p>The developer doesn't write off a re-boot down the road. "If Urban Dead is ever revivified or spun off in any way in the future," says Davis on the Urban Dead news page, "it'll be announced on this website."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A healthy pinch of my motivation for writing about waiter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> plate em' up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-way-of-the-tray">The Way Of The Tray</a> is so I can read your hospitality job horror stories in the comments, but I do love the energy here. It's a breathless, colourful (actual) plate-spinner that has you serve mythical dishes in the daily grind for tips from Yokai customers. You'll then invest those tips back into waiter skills and restaurant upgrades, or at least whatever petty cash is left over from paying rent.</p>

<p>I personally would not rely on the structural integrity of a layer of onigiri to support multiple clay bowls and glass bottles, but I am not a professional, nor do I have to please a clientele of demons, large spiders, and Kappas. I also personally wouldn't have written the phrase "immerse yourself in the mysterious atmosphere of Japan" in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/">Steam features</a>, since all you have to do there is add an '-ese folklore' to not sound like a 17th century powder-wigged buffoon trotting out his maid in Geisha makeup for tonight's dinner party entertainment. Here are some less irksomely worded features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the art of keeping your tray balanced: every mistake can cost you a tip. Learn to manage your time so you can serve all your guests on time and prevent them from leaving.</li>
<li>Serve unusual orders to yokai and learn all the secrets of local cuisine.</li>
<li>Develop your waiter skills to earn more tips and invest them in upgrades, and don’t forget to pay the rent.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own experience in food service includes frying up English breakfasts in a chippy cafe, temping for a catering company for weddings, and working in a Wetherspoons-grade pub kitchen (I believe the professional term is "microwave ape"). None of these were especially negative, mind. The chippy was in a popular holiday town, which led me to observe that some customers will treat any perceived imperfection as a direct assault on their perfect getaway, but I suppose the nature of limited leisure time makes solipsists of us all. As does paying six quid for a bacon roll. If I'd known you were going to be a Kappa I would have whacked extra cucumber in there, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The hideout is an acre of "fully customisable" land for Naoe and Yasuke to visit for a breather.  Once there, you can pop down buildings, shrubbery, animals, and decorations. The blog also specifies the placement of "mossy rocks". No other types though. Moss or piss off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's some grid snapping action.</p>
<figure>

<p>"Each building &amp; upgrade will also have a direct impact on gameplay," the blog says. The dojo trains combat allies. The forge upgrades weapons. A tea room lets you "increase ration efficiency", and so on. I assume that's something to do with health, although I'm now picturing a radical late nineties console advert in which a spiky-haired youth shouts downstairs at his parents that he can't go to grandma's house because he's "increasing ration efficiency, Mom!". Nothing says excitement like upgrade names that evoke board room minutes.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the grid snapping action also applies to animal companions, who you can pop down and visit to pet at your leisure. "We had all these endearing critters all over the world already," writes Dany of the senior design team, "and everyone's instant reaction is to drop everything they're doing and stare at them for a minute. It made sense for us to make them available inside of the Hideout."</p>
<p>This isn't entirely accurate to my experience with Assassin's Creed, since I actually spent a good chunk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a> on a personal quest to find every bear in Greece and kick them in the face. Call me out for being an awful cynic here, but this also feels like a case of "give the player what they think they want" at the expense of those moments Dany describes. I'm not sure how often I'd stop and to stare at wildlife in the open world if I've already got a hideout carpeted in deer poo.</p>
<p>To further populate, upgrade, and decorate your hideout, the open world is scattered with resources for you to collect - or possibly pay for since it's Assassin's Creed, a pioneer in the groundbreaking "give us a tenner for this bag of wood" monetisation field.</p>
<p>This is purely speculation on my part, however. Ubisoft have already announced they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">dropping the season pass model</a>, although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Steam listing</a> does offer a pricier edition that includes some DLC, so this feels more like a token rebranding than the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">currently flailing</a>) company turning over a new mossy rock.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I'm emanating pessimism like a <a href="https://freshare.net/persimmon-seeds-predict-warm-winter-above-average-snow-fall-in-the-ozarks-freshare-net/">snow hater dissecting a spoon-shaped persimmon seed</a>, so I should say that I think this all sounds like a pleasant and serene way to spend time between the hustle and/or bustle of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sengoku">Sengoku</a> period. A few customisation tools go a long way in helping you feel ownership over a space, and I'm a sucker for anything that lets me enjoy the vibe of pruning a bonsai without the anguish of having that bonsai die approximately fourteen seconds after I bring it home. Also, I like the sound of the ally conversations at the hideout:</p>
<p>"Having our allies in one place creates opportunities for character development," the blog says. "We gathered the writers (from 4 different studios all over the world) in a meeting and had them create interactions inspired by questions like, 'What would happen if these two characters suddenly became roommates?' I really love all the cool little moments they came up with. It makes the Hideout feel like the beating heart of the league".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“For the original games, the size of the dialogue box was quite small and there wasn’t a lot that we could fit in there," producer Yasuo Daikai <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-interview-suikoden-hd-remaster">told IGN back in 2022</a>. "Japanese is a language that can say a lot in a very short amount of space, but for English and other languages, you need a lot of space to say the same thing usually. So in this game we have expanded the size of those dialogue boxes, and that has let us retool and work on the localization to get us more in tune with the Japanese script,"</p>

<p>I wasn't able to check all or even most of the dialogue, instead pausing occasionally to compare the remasters to footage of the Playstation originals. But most lines I did compare are different. It's a fine translation, but one that sometimes sacrifices idiosyncratic character for what feels like cautious legibility. Considering how difficult these games are to own legally, my ideal package would have been one that preserved the original scripts in some form.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stilted becomes the colloquial in ways that feel sensible and deft. Viktor's "Prepare yourselves for a surprise" from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 is now "you might wanna sit down for this". Sometimes, the poetic becomes more commonplace. "Not that I see our reunion in the stars," Leknaat tells the hero in the original. "Not based on an astrology reading," she says now. Odessa's "Our tiny newborn hope must be kept alive" is now "that small flame of hope must be kept alive."</p>
<p>Other changes are more subjective, depending on how much you like Suikoden's goofiness, but seem clear examples of extra space being used. Instead of the hero having the option to tell Emperor Barbarossa "I don't wanna", he can now say "not if I can help it".</p>
<p>I've only played a little of Suikoden 2 at time of writing, but every line I compared in the introduction is slightly different. Again, these strike me as a translator using the extra space that Daikai mentioned to craft more precise lines. Jowy's "Me too. I thought about going back to Kyaro and I couldn't wait to get out of that uniform" is now "Me too, actually. No way I could stay in that uniform any longer knowing we're headed home to Kyaro." Luca Blight's "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that old man. I'm getting rusty" is now "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that stupid old man. I'm falling out of practise."</p>

<p>Since review embargo is up, I can tell you I'm having a lovely time revisiting two games that are precious to me beyond words (which is awkward because I have to write about them). There are also plenty of features in support of preservation: music, cutscene, and cinematic galleries with concept art backgrounds. There's no lack of love or care here. Suikoden I character designer Junko Kawano's new portraits are a real treat, especially. But - speaking purely in terms of preservation - there's something irreplaceable about a fourteen year old answering an emperor's request with "I don't wanna", and I'd have loved to see an original translation menu toggle.</p>
<p>(Yes - the dragons still sound like elephants.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
