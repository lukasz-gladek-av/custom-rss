            <p>A new joint investigation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">Guardian</a>, Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/">+972 Magazine</a>, and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/">Local Call</a> has claimed that Microsoft have worked with the Israeli military to store surveillance data on Palestinian civilians in Azure servers overseas, with some of that data allegedly being used to research and identify bombing targets. The report has led to renewed calls for game developers and players to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">the recently launched Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign</a> against Microsoft and Xbox gaming products and services - in particular, Minecraft, Call Of Duty, Candy Crush, and Game Pass. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report is based on interviews with 11 sources from Microsoft and the Israeli military, plus access to a cache of leaked Microsoft documents. In late 2021, the Guardian piece begins, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with Yossi Sariel, the commander of Israel's military surveillance agency Unit 8200, to discuss plans for storing intelligence data on Microsoft cloud servers. According to the report's sources, the inspiration for these proposals was that Israel's military did not have the storage space or computing power to handle the amount of data they wanted to collect and process.
</p>
<p>The alleged result of that conversation was a cloud-based system that became operational in 2022, and has been used to gather "indiscriminate" recordings of Palestinian phone calls in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the report, as of July this year around 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data were being held in Microsoft Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion were stored in Ireland, though not all of this data may be from Unit 8200.
</p>
<p>"Thanks to the control it exerts over Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure, Israel has long intercepted phone calls in the occupied territories," the report notes. "But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians." One of the investigation's sources also explains how these phone recordings may have been used to plan airstrikes, commenting that intelligence officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the vicinity of an individual target.</p>
<p>Sariel ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings">resigned his position in September 2024</a> in response to criticism for failing to anticipate the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Israeli civilians in October 2023, which left over a thousand dead with hundreds taken hostage. According to this week's Guardian report, he was accused of prioritising fancy new technology over older surveillance methods.</p>
<p>But the cloud-based system he allegedly developed with Microsoft's assistance is said to remain in use alongside AI-driven target recommendation tools, as the Israeli military continues a punitive and open-ended assault on Gaza that has killed over 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, and left hundreds of thousands more homeless and starving.</p>
<p>The report argues that Microsoft had some awareness during development of the system that it was being used to collect phone calls and facilitate airstrikes. It cites internal records that show that during the initial 2021 meeting with Nadella, Sariel referred only to "sensitive workloads" of secret data, not the storage of Palestinian phone calls. But it adds that "documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files" and that Israel-based Microsoft staff, who allegedly include former members of Unit 8200, appear to have known about the project's overall objectives. </p>
<p>The report also references files that show that Microsoft executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue from the project, calling it "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">confirmed that they had supplied technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. But they insisted that they had found "no evidence" that it was being used to target or harm Palestinians, citing an external review carried out by an unnamed third party.</p>
<p>They have also pushed back on this week's claims, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the Guardian that they have "no information" on the data being stored in the cloud by Unit 8200. "At no time during this engagement," the spokesperson added, "has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<p>Asked about Nadella and Sariel's relationship, the spokesperson continued that the CEO "attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting" and there was "no discussion" of the exact content of the "sensitive workloads" above.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Microsoft's comments, this week's news has fuelled calls to join the BDS boycott, with some participants pointing out that this doesn't have to mean parting ways entirely with any and all Microsoft services. "BDS has a standing boycott target on Microsoft products which people can realistically drop from their lives, understanding that not everyone can change their operating system," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a> lead artist and gameplay designer Allison Shabet in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rally.luckyraven.cc/post/3lvr42n2vm22i">a Bluesky post yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3lvr4m3lhi222">Bluesky thread</a>, game designer and writer Austin Walker added that "I've obviously been saying this a lot lately, but BDS does not expect anyone to drop everything made by Microsoft all at once. They pick very specific targets in order to get as wide a coalition as possible, and in the case of Xbox, even suggest different tiers of engagement."

            <p>If you've tried to hop into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta's early access period this morning and have ended up sitting a queue behind thousands of other folks in camo gear, then don't panic. Or at least that's what EA say, as their wrenches slam against the game's servers in an attempt to let more people in.</p>
<p>With players stuck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mjubus/i_guess_im_not_playing_tonight/">twiddling</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju39x/im_getting_trolled_by_the_servers/">their</a> <a href="https://x.com/Sephiroth_VM/status/1953395511010173366">thumbs</a> in lines that can stick you as far away as 240-something thousandth from the front, the developers have been jolted into action. After all, you don't want to anger the sorts of folks who're up for shooting some blokes on an otherwise chill Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue," the official Battlefield comms account tweeted amid the cries. "Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible."</p>
<p>As of a few minutes ago, it appears that works begun to see the lines go down. "We are now seeing signs of queue numbers returning to suitable levels and times," reads a follow-up tweet, "Thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the issue. We'll continue to keep an eye on queues and server capacity, and will follow up where needed!"</p> <div>

<p>So, hopefully if you've had to wait for your dose of early FPS access this morning, you should now be facing less time spent staring at a number. Maybe you've been smart and decided to give up on the line until this afternoon, in which case it sounds like you should end up getting in pretty rapidly if you're lucky.</p>
<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta from today, August 7th, (early access) or August 9th (general), then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">read this</a>.

        <p>It's allegedly dubbed Deep of Night, and you've got to dig pretty deep into the net to find much info on it</p>

            <p>Some dataminers digging into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s files following the arrival of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning">Duos update</a> claim to have uncovered some details about an endless mode.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/">PC Gamer</a>, said new mode is allegedly called 'Deep of Night', and will see you grouped with similarly skiller nighfarers to fight your way up through the ranks of a new rating system that players reckon could work similarly to Armored Core 6's rankings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of writing, the main sources of info about this endless mode are a Reddit thread penned by a user with the handle Adminisitrator and a video from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkLAD97-hCA">Scavinjx</a>. Having delved through a number of Reddit threads on the subject, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mgb1gf/comment/n6ncwnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it appears</a> the original discovery of the files might have been by a user named <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3286774?spm_id_from=333.1369.opus.module_author_name.click">Supuritto</a>, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1096362317248987138">shared their findings</a> on Chinese social media site BiliBili.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/">Adminisitrator's thread</a>, the in-game description of the mode reads as follows: "The Deep of Night is is a battlefield of endless Night. Victory will increase your rating, burnishing your depth. The darkness extends unto infinity." So, a long series of fights with the lights turned off, getting deeper and harder as you go, if you'll forgive the inherent Kenneth Williams 'ooh, Matron' nature of that last bit.</p>
<p>The dataminers claim you'll be working your way through five depths, with each having 999 rating levels to work your way up through, aside from depth five, which is for those elite boss battlers who reach rating 6000 or more. If you lose a fight, you'll slide back down the ratings and depths, but it looks like once you're through depth one, you can't be sent back beyond depth two. I assume that last bit might be a measure to limit cheeky low-level grinding by hardened vets.</p>
<p>As for new rewards, the post shows off screenshots of "depth relics" which it says you'll be able to equip in three new slots just for Deep of Night runs. These come with two buffs, plus one pesky debuff. New weapons work along the same lines, such as a great omenkiller cleaver that boosts your health restoration and damage negation, but increases the damage dealt to by by the encroaching night. Some enemies and bosses also look to be getting "magmafied" variants, which as you might expect see them turned a bit more orange, and I assume able to dish out some toasty damage.</p>
<p>As ever with leaks and datamines, it's worth taking all of this with a grain of salt unless FromSoftware announce that we are all going into the Deep of Night. The mode certainly looks like it could be an interesting alternative to the current weekly boss rotation that arguably leaves a bit to be desired, though I'll likely end up doing a Sum 41 and be in too deep fairly quickly.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-getting-an-endless-mode-with-special-relics-and-magmafied-bosses-claim-dataminers]]></content:encoded>
