            <p>I really, really like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> It might just be that this logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.</p>
<p>You've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. "I want to sit with Bob". "I need a window seat". "I forgot to shower". "I do not like bad smells". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.</p>

<p>Here's what the Steam page - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">which also has a demo</a> - has to say:</p>
<blockquote>"Window seat or aisle? Booth or table? Lone wolf or life of the party? In Is This Seat Taken?, your mission is to organize groups of people according to their preferences. It’s a cozy, no-pressure logic puzzle game where you’re in charge of who sits where."</blockquote><p>

Here are some features, arranged in the correct order:

</p><blockquote><ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed this one, as I said. I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head. The world's first <em>Seatlike</em>? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed. No release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar Games are considering letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> players modify the game’s map by way of Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics, according to a report. The idea is that people can make and sell their own “custom experiences”, as they do in those games - expanding upon the existing customisation opportunities in GTA Online. This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. 
</p>
<p>
All of that’s from <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/">a Digiday article</a> that cites three anonymous industry sources “with knowledge” of meetings between Rockstar and certain popular Fortnite, Roblox and GTA Online creators. Apparently, they’ve been having “open-ended” discussions about “the potential to create custom experiences inside the upcoming game”. These experiences “would allow creators to modify the game’s environment and assets to bring their own intellectual property - and potentially their brand sponsors - into GTA’s virtual sandbox”, the article notes.
</p>
<p>
Why do all this, given Rockstar’s historically iffy relationship with those who attempt to mod their games? Because publishers always want to make more money, and because GTA 6 in particular is said to be mindbogglingly expensive. It’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/13/gta-6-cost-2-000-000-000-make-claims-leak-eight-times-gta-5-21413035/">rumoured</a> to have cost two billion dollars to date. Hence the pressure to add monetisation features.
</p>
<p>
The Digiday article includes some third party comment that puts a spotlight on FiveM, the immensely popular mod framework from CFX.re that lets people host their own GTA role-playing servers, and supports subscription access models. Rockstar used to be at war with CFX.re as part of their larger policy towards piracy: they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">banned</a> members of the modding team back in 2015 and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/take-two-reportedly-sent-private-investigators-to-modders-home/">reportedly</a> sent private investigators to somebody’s home. Then, in August 2023, they <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">announced</a> that they’d bought the CFX.re team and “expanded our policy on mods to officially include those made by the roleplay creative community.”
</p>
<p>
Digiday offer the FiveM arc as evidence that Rockstar are getting more into user-generated content platforms and Ye Olde Metaversing with GTA 6. All of which makes sense to me, though the developers and publisher Take-Two Interactive have yet to comment on the report at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">wait for a GTA 6 PC release date continues</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
