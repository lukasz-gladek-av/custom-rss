            <p>
You know, with the original Paranormal Activity steadily approaching two decades of existence, it's becoming harder and harder to recognise what it actually was and is as opposed to the cultural consensus around it. First and foremost you probably think of it as a cheap, jump-scare-filled kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> movie, when in actuality the first entry in the series is a slow, tense window into the world of gaslighting and, obviously, the paranormal. Being as removed as we are from this means one thing: IP expansion, which we're viewing today in the form of the first proper trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paranormal-activity-found-footage">Paranormal Activity: Threshold</a>, the video game adaptation from the developer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mortuary-assistant">The Mortuary Assistant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let's set the scene, with some assistance from the game's description on Steam. Paranormal Activity: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threshold">Threshold</a> focuses on Daniel and Jessica Stewart, who've just decided to remodel their first home. We're introduced to said home by Daniel, showing a fairly sized if sparsely decorated building that he describes as the only one they could afford. Sure thing Daniel!

<p>
The rest of the trailer shows a variety of hauntings and happenings like a shadow moving across the room, a stool sliding along the floor, a door suddenly shutting. There's some kind of vaguely satanic-looking puzzle you can do, but aside from that it doesn't really show much of the broader activities you'll be participating in.
</p><p>
Returning to Steam again, there's an explanation that you can "play in multiple timelines," "hunt and communicate with entities," and "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate." There's apparently multiple endings, and the game's "Paranormal Engine makes every playthrough unique." My guess is that different playthroughs can have different hauntings as I described above take place randomly, which if I'm right, sounds quite similar to the hauntings you can experience in Silent Hill 4's pseudo-hub area.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit that I feel quite apprehensive about Paranormal Activity getting a game adaptation. I can count the number of good entries in the film series on one hand, but there's two hands worth of films to count, distorting what it could be if done well. How might a game adaptation deal with such a framework? Is a game even capable of capturing that tactile feel an actual tape presents like in the first film, having you question what's real and what isn't? I'm not sure that there's enough filters in the world to convey such a feeling.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date for Paranormal Activity: Threshold, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3394030/Paranormal_Activity_Threshold/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
Last month, something a bit surprising, and perhaps concerning, took place in the games industry: a deal was made which saw that a mixture of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had privately acquired EA. There's a whole host of reasons why this is worrisome, but one reason in particular is the way that it might affect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it isn't exactly a paragon of identity politics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> has by and large been a game that welcomes and encourages people of all creeds, notably LGBTQIA+ folks. It is probably safe to assume that these new owners, however, will not be so welcoming. In fact, concern has been so great over this acquisition that the biggest Sims YouTuber around lilsimsie has <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6?si=sglHvJEekR-fr1md">left EA's Creator Network</a>, having been joined by other big Sims YouTubers like <a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53?si=OTATMfwD8usqaILA">Plumbella</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=4KaoEumB9X0jgD7u">James Turner</a>.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
In turn, a message has now been shared by The Sims team on its official Dwitter account seemingly attempting to assuage some of the above concerns, though it has been delivered in a bit of a vague tone. "We're continually inspired by our incredible players and creators; by your imagination, creativity, and the joy you bring to The Sims every day," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply respect that everyone experiences The Sims in their own way and will make choices that are right for them. However you choose to play, create, or share, we’re grateful to be part of your journey. Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same. The Sims will always be a space where you can express your authentic self."
</p><p>
The statement carries on with an even vaguer bit about how everyone's "passion and voices" have affected bits to come in 2026, and that on November 4th there'll be a new update coming to The Sims with "150+ fixes and fresh freebies." Notably, this update is "the first of ongoing updates that address the things that matter most to you," though personally this feels slightly disconnected from the main message and is more addressed at those who are frustrated with how broken the game often can be.
</p>
<p>
This is all well and good for now, it's just still a bit too early to tell what kind of effects this acquisition will have. For now let's all just cross our fingers for the future of any staff members currently working at EA.
