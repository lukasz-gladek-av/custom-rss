            <p>Still troubled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>’ stubbornly sedate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">PC performance</a>, even after multiple patches <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">claiming</a> to grease its framerate gears? The good news is that Capcom have committed to pushing through performance and stability updates into, at the very least, Winter 2025. The bad news is that Capcom also say they won’t have finished their performance and stability improvements until, at the earliest, Winter 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/letter-2508/">In a post</a> detailing tomorrow’s version 1.021 update, game director Yuya Tokuda ran through Capcom’s future plans for the PC version, specifically how they intend to bring down Wilds’ CPU load. The post frames this as an attempt to protect players’ chips by reducing the stress it’s under while playing, but in theory such a change could improve overall performance by allowing CPUs extra go-fast headroom. However, Tokuda specifies that this change will be part of Title Update 4, which is currently down for release sometime between November and January – the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html">1.021 update itself</a> doesn’t include any notable performance tweaks whatsoever.</p>
<p>What’s more, this will only be phase one of the CPU optimisation plan: "Once the initial implementation is complete," the post reads, "we will proceed with a second stage of further mitigation measures."</p>
<p>That’s not all you're getting – Tokuda adds that unspecified future patches will "address GPU load reduction in a similar manner" – but if you were hoping to finally fell and skin MHW’s performance gremlins anytime soon, there is in fact little to do except watch Capcom keep scraping away at the whetstone and pray that these updates will be more successful than the last few. On that note, although some small gains have been made, Wilds still doesn’t run particularly smoothly even on higher-end <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a>, and some of Capcom’s attempts to soothe the pain (such as enabling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation</a> by default, in a tragic misunderstanding of how frame generation is supposed to work) have smacked of cheap tricks rather than clever solutions.</p><p>Will these future patches prove any more successful? I couldn’t say, though other parts of Tokuda’s post aren’t massively enthusing. "In general, increasing the native frame rate will also increase CPU usage," he writes. "If the frame rate limit is set to unlimited or a high value in the options, CPU performance will be maximized in the attempt to increase the frame rate, which may result in a very high CPU usage. Please adjust your graphics options to limit the frame rate in accordance with your hardware's specifications."</p>
<p>Ah, see, maybe low framerates aren’t the problem. It’s <em>you</em>, the feckless player, who is leaving the framerate limit too high, thus causing... bad CPU utilisation, somehow. Don’t worry, though. You only need to keep blaming yourself until we switch to Big Coat weather. Maybe.</p>

            <p>Following Itch.io's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">mass delisting of adult games</a> in response to pressure from payment processors, a new report includes claims from LGBTQ+ devs that safe-for-work titles with lesbian or yuri themes have also been affected.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Valve</a> changed their rules on adult content last month, with the issue evolving into a complex pointing of fingers which traced from the storefronts, to credit card companies, and on to an Australian protest group. That group, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a>, claimed responsibility for exerting the initial pressure that got the ball rolling. Itch.io have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/major-payment-firm-behind-itch-adult-game-cull-say-they-themselves-face-restrictions-from-another-banking-firm">allowed free adult games back onto the platform</a>, but paid ones currently remain on the naughty step as the storefront seeks new payment processors.</p>

<p>Naturally, that's had a substantial affect on developers of NSFW games, which this extensive report from <a href="https://transnews.network/p/i-feel-violated-queer-creators-lose-livelihoods-in-itch-io-bans">Trans News Network</a> delves into. It touches on the various situations of LGBTQ+ devs from a number of different countries, and sees a few of them claim that even safe-for-work lesbian or yuri games have been affected by the ban. For the unfamiliar, yuri is a genre of Japanese media focusing on relationships between women. These can be of a romantic nature, but aren't always.</p>
<p>Having had an NSFW demo taken down as part of the deindexing, developer <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/">krispycat</a> claims they searched up three of their safe-for-work games (<a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/wendy">Wendy</a>, <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/wendy">Warm</a>, and <a href="https://krispycat.itch.io/warm">Like Seafoam</a>). "However, they don't appear in the suggestions either - I suspect it's because they're yuri games," they said. "I am concerned that my audience will be severely cut. I'm already having to search for other places to release [the full game that accompanies their NSFW demo], and am worrying where I will be able to release future projects as well."</p><p>Another developer known as Maddie May AKA <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/certifydmilkboy.bsky.social">Milkboy</a> also claims that a safe-for-work project of hers has been deindexed as part of the changes. Meanwhile, the report cites writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/deetheredwitch.bsky.social">Dee</a> as claiming that her works don't contain anything that violates Itch's content rules, but have still been deindexed. A game jam dubbed the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/toxic-yuri-vn-jam">Toxic Yuri Game Jam</a> has also reportedly seen over half of its 200 plus games delisted, with several removed from Itch.io completely.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Itch.io for comment.</p>
<p>It's worth giving the full report a read, as it features numerous tales of the effect this content policy change has had on the lives and livelihoods of affected devs.</p>
<p>"I am an older millennial queer and I remember the feelings of loneliness and the void of just not having anything like me in what I played," said developer <a href="https://taylormccue.itch.io/">Taylor McCue</a>. "I got to see Itch become a renaissance of queer works and community. I viewed it as an art movement and a potential future that I was a part of. Since my game has been de-indexed, I don’t know what to think. The pessimistic part of me knew this day would come, but I didn’t think it would come so soon. When it did come I thought Itch would at least email me or something."</p><p>If you're keen for more information as to how payment processors and similar companies can influence where adult content's permitted and what's considered as falling under the definition of it, make sure to read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">our Edwin's in-depth feature</a> on the topic.</p>
