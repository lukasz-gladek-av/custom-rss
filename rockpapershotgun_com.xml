            <p>The headcounts of both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev teams continue to steadily climb, as the two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> inch closer to our fingertips. Meanwhile, CD Projekt have confirmed that their research division are still busy deciding what the mysterious original game codenamed Project Hadar will look like.</p>
<p>All of these details, plus some Nintendo Switch stuff we've avoided hearing by sticking our mouse and keyboard-focused fingers in our ears, were revealed in the Polish publishers' <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-first-half-of-2025/">financial report</a> covering the first half of 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, the big guns. As outlined by the handy chart below, The Witcher 4 had 422 people working on it as of April 30 and saw that number grow to 444 people by the close of July, while Cyberpunk 2 has hopped over the three digit threshold in that time, going from 96 chooms to 116. Oh bugger, sorry for dropping the c-bomb, that Cyberpunk playthrough I'm still on with is clearly getting to me.</p>
<p>"Our recruitment efforts have significantly sped up over the last three months, and as a result the total number of talented developers working across our projects has grown by 10%, reaching almost 800 people," CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski explained in a presentation to investors. It's worth noting that this current growth follows the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-announces-another-batch-of-layoffs-affecting-around-100-employees">laying off staff</a> back in 2023, with some remaining workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-staff-form-union-after-layoffs-and-want-everybody-in-the-industry-to-join">deciding to unionise as a result</a>.</p><div>

<p>With Cyberpunk 2 now having fully moved from the research section of CD Projekt's books into the development section - it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">in pre-production</a> for a little while now - the mysterious Project Hadar's the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/management-board-report-on-cd-projekt-group-activities-in-h1-2025-1.pdf">most expensive research project</a> CD Projekt have on the go. While we have some sense now of The Witcher 4, Cyberpunk 2, and Molasses Flood's Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, Hadar remains an enigma several years on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-are-making-a-new-witcher-trilogy-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-and-a-brand-new-ip">initial announcement back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>We know it's going to be an original story, and some <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/">job listings</a> have suggested that it's an action RPG with melee combat. Nowakowski's also been <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758">weirdly specific in ruling out</a> that it's a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan". Aside from that, shrug emoji. Though, with Hadar's 22 person strong team now looking to be the main focus of CD projekt's research department, the company's investors are clearly as curious for more info on it as we are.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/transcript-h1-2025-earnings.pdf">call accompanying these financials</a>, one of them rather bluntly asked whether any decisions regarding the game's future would be made by the end of this year or 2026. Nowakowski seemed a bit taken aback by the idea of sharing more so soon.</p>
<p>"Hadar is still basically an IP concept, so not a game development project yet," he responded. "We’re working on the game’s story, its background – so to say; there is some prototyping going on in terms of gameplay, because it’s hard not to do that when the end goal is to make a video game – but I’m not sure what you mean by 'decisions' – I mean, as in to progress to development, or whether we’re going to make [a game] or not…? We want to make this IP happen, so that decision is sort of made in terms of – when we’re going to go into development, we will announce it in due time, I think."</p><p>You could argue it's been a bit of a strange move for CD Projekt to have announced Hadar at the same time they did the fresh Witcher trilogy and Cyberpunk 2, if they were still going to be at this early a stage with it nearly three years down the line. Then again, that kind of transparency's great for us journos and has probably helped CD Projekt recruit folks to work on Hadar. My money's on it being a Keanu Reeves gacha game with 4X strategy elements and a roguelike mode based around the concept of the word 'woah'.</p>

            <p>A group of more than 450 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a> developers have voted to form a union at Blizzard, under the banner of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p>
<p>According to a CWA press release, the new union is made up of game developers, artists, designers, engineers, and support staff across the Diablo series, and has already been formally recognised by Blizzard parent company Microsoft. These workers join the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">over 500</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">almost 200</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs who each formed their own unions earlier this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd imagine, Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> were a big factor in these Diablo staffers opting to union up now, with other concerns including the avoidance of crunch and a "passion tax" that centres around the idea you might feel obligated to accept less for a dream job.</p>
<p>"With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us," said Kelly Yeo, a Diablo game producer and member of the organising committee member. "I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues."</p>
<p>Ryan Littleton, another Diablo game designer and committee member, added:</p>
<blockquote>The day after the third round of mass layoffs, I walked into the office, and when I tried to open the door to the cafeteria, my badge was denied. For a moment, I wondered if getting breakfast was how I'd find out I was part of that round. While luckily it was just a technical issue, none of us should have to live with that constant worry that we might be let go at the drop of a hat. A union allows us to organize across the industry to make great games and protect the developers who create them from the constant pressures of layoffs, passion tax, and crunch.</blockquote>
<p>Teams at Blizzard aren't the only folks at Microsoft who've moved to unionise recently. Staff at the likes of Call of Duty developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">Raven Software</a>, Fallout and Elder Scrolls studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda</a>, and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax have also opted to seek protections. In the case of unionised ZeniMax staff, their union claimed it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">fighting for the jobs of workers</a> left in limbo by the abrupt cancellation of an unannounced MMO as part of Microsoft's July mass layoffs.</p>
<p>Solidarity to these freshly-unionised Diablo devs.</p>

            <p>
Red Hook have just released the third and final part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>’s Kingdoms mode - a boardgame-style add-on experience that sees you moving a stagecoach around a map’s worth of benighted inns, fending off pigmen, witches and - as of this update - giant mosquitos. 
</p>
<p>
To celebrate, they’ve also made the base roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> free on Steam until September 1st. Admittedly, being offered Darkest Dungeon 2 for free is a bit like somebody warmly offering to give you the plague. But this is the fun kind of plague, a plague rich in dicey turn-based battles, grindy but engrossing character development, and suppurating vistas of cthulhoid swampfields.

<p>
I think that, on balance, I prefer the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>’s cliffside ambience and town/dungeon format. I find the older side-scrolling dungeons less fussy than the second game’s branching 3D road systems, and I think the original game’s handling of sanity and darkness is expressed more compellingly through the layered dungeon soundtrack. Here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-review">what Joe Donnelly thought about it</a> in 2016: "You’ll cry. And cry and cry and cry. But I think you’ll love it."</p><p>I think the second game’s combat system is superior, though – it boils off some of the numberfluff and introduces a more readable system of HUD tokens, while retaining the same, diabolical relationship between party member positioning and skill availability. Laena Hafer summarised the game thusly in our 2023 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2-review">Darkest Dungeon 2 review</a>: "A roguelite sequel that takes a few steps forward and one or two back from the original, but keeps the gloomy but intense spirit alive."
</p>
<p>
If you’ve played neither, both are fine, gruelling RPGs with amazing narration and glorious visuals cut straight from the pages of Hellboy. Kingdoms brings back a little of the first game’s feel, married to the second game’s wagoneering, but is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">pretty much its own thing</a>. You must defend inns as they come under siege, while travelling about to gather party members and complete a central questline before the map is swamped by nasties. Speaking of which, here's what they're adding in the third major Kingdoms update Curse of the Court, which is available now:
</p>
<blockquote>Swarms of Bloodsuckers have descended upon the Kingdom, bringing with them a supernatural contagion that can inflict your heroes with the dreaded Crimson Curse! Players will be challenged in an all-new questline to find a cure for this rapidly spreading infection and exterminate The Bloodsuckers before time runs out! Additionally, this release features new achievements to earn, and three new Kingdoms maps, each with a different layout that presents a unique set of challenges. These new maps are playable on any of the three different Kingdoms modules.</blockquote>
<p>
If you come down with a severe case of Dankest Sturgeon 2 this weekend, take comfort in the knowledge that they’re running a discount alongside the free timed promotion - 63% off, or more if you buy a bundle with all the DLC.
