            <p>A long time ago in, well, this galaxy, actually, Quantic Dream announced that they were making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, a cinematic adventure from the High Jedi era in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dreams-star-wars-game-isnt-dead-but-anyone-can-die-in-it">everybody can die</a>. Alice Bee (RPS in peace) poured soothing oil over the flames of hype by saying it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-let-how-cool-the-star-wars-eclipse-trailer-is-trick-you-this-game-will-not-be-good">probably going to be rubbish</a>, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">reports of abusive working conditions</a>. NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired Quantic Dream in 2022</a>. Then, nothing was shown for many years. The world froze in anticipation like Han Solo doing jazz hands through carbonite.</p>
<p>Now, finally, some news, albeit the unofficial kind. Leaked concept artworks and pitching documents have shown off a few of the new game's races.</p><!--more-->
<p>As discovered on a now-removed portfolio, and originally reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-star-wars-eclipse-concept-art-leak">MP1st</a>, the WIP and/or prototype images include shots of a Zenezian, a Rodian, and a Gungan. There are some characters who are described as smugglers, and a couple of possible character names: "Travis" and "Jotraaaz Kammzzzek", which suggests that Eclipse will walk an <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>-style path around the brainfarts of George Lucas naming conventions. One of the smugglers has a big white beard and a selection of slit visors. It's sort of Geordi La Forge trying to dress as Santa, but it's already Xmas eve and the only shop left open sells lumberjack supplies.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that many Star Wars races are extremely dodgy caricatures of non-white people, despite efforts to tidy away the stinker characterisations of the Phantom Menace era, and Quantic Dream are the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heavy-rain-detroit-become-human-and-beyond-two-souls-coming-to-pc">"a monstrously clumsy allegory for racism"</a>. I'm not sure I'd trust them with the Gungans.</p>
<p>There's still no release date for Eclipse. Earlier this year, Quantic Dream vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse commented that "one of the amazing things about working with NetEase is that they're not imposing release dates on us". I imagine another thing they're thankful for is that NetEase have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">so far spared Quantic Dream from any layoffs</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">wider cost-cutting</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hello and good New Week to ye, traveller! And my, my - what a New Week it is. We're taking the desperate toil of feeding the Maw to strange new places. I'll spell that out in a separate post to come, once I've caught up on emails during my absence last week and in general, remembered how to do my job, but you may already notice certain sinister adjustments to the format. I welcome any feedback and wanton abuse. In the meantime, here are some new PC games. </p>
<p>It's a quieter one, after Obliviongate last week, but there are some standouts. Monday 28th April brings the programmable robot block building of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2613890/Icaria/">Icaria</a> - the kind of game I enjoy hearing about but will never muster the neurones to play. Tuesday 29th April? I will delicately avoid Tuesday 29th because Tuesdays are overrated and it's high time somebody said it. Nothing useful, beautiful or truthful ever happens on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th April is a day of meaty tribulations, thanks to Slavic manko-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moroi">Moroi</a>... and of joyful spacecat salvation, thanks to immersive sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. On Thursday 1st May, another unusual pairing: Ecuadorian slice-of-life soccer adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, and Lovecraftian house mystery <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-horror-at-highrook">The Horror At Highrook</a>. And on Friday 2nd May, it's time for no-roles naval MOBA <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/">Sirocco</a>. I haven't played an actual, undiluted MOBA in years. This one has galleons, which might be enough to reel me in.</p>
<p>What's on the news agenda this week? Probably a fair bit more about the Oblivion remaster, which is exasperating young people who haven't quite clocked that it's still an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from 2006, with none of the modcons you'd expect from, I don't know, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. We'll also be taking a closer look at Skin Deep and The Horror At Highrook. Beyond that, I've got my eternally uncleansable backlog of interview-based features to pick at.

            <p>If you've read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">my review</a> of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, you'll know I loved it. It's pretty handily my game of the year so far, and an all-timer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> besides. It's a hugely impressive piece of game magic, and I'm certainly not trying to diminish that.</p>
<p>However, the culture being what it is, I keep seeing the game's quality weaponised against the state of game development in general. Even celebrations are often accompanied by some variation on the phrase "<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/speechless-clair-obscur-expedition-33-the-first-game-from-a-studio-filled-with-ex-ubisoft-devs-is-officially-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/">made</a> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/clair-obscur-expedition-33-doubles-its-sales-now-sold-1-million-units">by</a> <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller-1534943/">just</a> <a href="https://fandomwire.com/its-the-scene-where-the-four-main-characters-are-clair-obscur-expedition-33-owes-its-entire-existence-to-a-final-fantasy-xv-scene/">30</a> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-massive-success-player-count-over-100k">developers</a>". It's good to be impressed by things! I was impressed too. And I generally agree with the sentiment that game development has become untenably bloated. It's a very tasty narrative, but the figures are a bit sloppy. No need to listen to me, anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/04wAYTaqNkI">The credits are actually very easy to find</a>.</p>

<p>In brief: Sandfall themselves are, indeed, around 30 people. I counted maybe 34 but there's a few people pulling dual roles across writing, quest design, and so on. That's amazing, no doubt. The story starts to look a bit different, however, once the bulk of the credits begin to roll.</p>
<p>Firstly, there's the eight-person Korean 'gameplay animation' team. If you've played any of Clair Obscur, you'll know how vital animations are to its combat. Monsters feint and twirl in battle, pulling off elaborate combos that you'll need to parry and dodge. While we don't know specifically what 'gameplay animation' refers to, the only comparable discipline in-house on Sandfall's side is 'cinematic and performance capture'. So, I'm left to conclude that this Korean team are effectively responsible for a large part of why combat is fun in the first place, and a fair chunk of the game's personality besides.</p>
<p>To those eight animators, add the dozens on dozens of people that worked on localisation, QA, and voice production work. And then there are the 30-plus musicians that worked on the soundtrack, including a nine person choir. As far as the in-house Sandfall credits for music go, only lead composer Lorien Testard, three vocalists, and the audio and music lead designer are listed. Again: I'm absolutely not suggesting Sandfall or anyone else is telling porkies or burying talent here. I only bring this up to say that, even just accounting for the music that's so vital to Clair Obscur's essence as a work, we can effectively double that '30 people' narrative.</p>
<p>I'm conscious that this all reflects a tendency in UK and US reporting to minimise contributions from outsourced workers and support studios in East Asia and elsewhere. In many ways, this is playing right into the industry's preferred narrative. A few years back, People Make Games reported on the AAA industry's habit of "<a href="https://youtu.be/bm7KUE1Kwts">buying crunch overseas". </a>I'm not suggesting Sandfall themselves are doing anything like this, of course  - evidence points to the contrary, in fact. And in many cases, news writers on a time crunch are simply repeating whatever line has been accepted as common wisdom, rather than deliberately obfuscating the reality. I can understand why these catchy claims spread so quickly.</p>
<p>Once more: if Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was made by 500 people, it'd still be an incredible work. It has the good game sauce, and clearly came from a place of love, inspiration, and the desire to tell a story. Doing math equations with talent and resources is a phenomenally boring way to judge art. But celebrating the wrong things - or the right thing with the wrong information -  always feels a bit hollow to me. So, don't skip the credits.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
