            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> games were some of the first non-FromSoft Soulslikes to find their own audience, probably in part because they're not really Soulslikes at all. They're Team Ninja action RPGs, drawn from their wellspring of experience making such games, and despite Nioh's 2017 release date, it spawned from a project that began development all the way back in 2004, firmly pre-Souls.
</p>
<p>Why all the preamble, rather than getting straight into the news? Well, because the news is in the headline: Nioh 3 was just announced at this evening's State Of Play. Once again it looks like it's coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, with no PC release in sight.

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, Nioh 3 contains larger open areas to be explored, as well as new "ninja style" combat mode. It's due for release sometime in 2026, but if you've got a PlayStation 5, there's a demo you can play right now.
</p>
<p>The original Nioh launched on PlayStation 4 in February 2017 and was available on PC by November of the same year. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a> took a little longer, arriving on PS4 in March 2020 and on PC (and PlayStation 5) in February 2021. It seems a safe bet to assume Nioh 3 will make the leap to PC as well, but it's a shame that we'll have to wait yet again.
</p>
<p>This evening's State Of Play brought plenty news of games we won't need to wait for, including trailers for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Capcom's Pragmata</a> and IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, which are both launching simultaneously across platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The horniest tuxedo-loving spy you know has stepped out of the shadows once more. Developers IO Interactive showed off a trailer for 007 First Light during Sony's State Of Play stream this evening, days after announcing the third-person action adventure's full title (it was previously known as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-007">Project 007</a>"). It's an origin story about a baby-faced Bond that looks considerably more quippy than any of the recent movies. Find the trailer below. </p>

<p>This is certainly ticking a lot of classic Bond boxes, like soirées and yachts and insufferable machismo. He looks like a Dreamworks Chris Pine. I am excited about IO turning their Hitman experience towards a game with a broader list of verbs though, like "drive" and "talk".</p>
<p>It makes sense that Bond is younger here, given that First Light <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactives-project-007-could-be-the-beginning-of-a-bond-trilogy">could be the beginning of a trilogy</a>, IO Interactive have said in the past. The studio are best known for their own recent trilogy of Hitman games, which let you playfully murder all types of terrible people, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitman-and-the-joy-of-killing-your-boss">including your boss</a>. Choosing such a studio to make a game about the world's least suble spook seemed a logical choice for the rights-holders of James Bond, although we know by now that this Jimmy wouldn't was never going to be an anti-aliased photograph of Daniel Craig on top of a bunch of polygons. </p>
<p>“It's the beginning of something new and it's the beginning, hopefully, of something that the gamers can call their own," said studio co-owner Christian Elverdam, explaining how the developers wanted a Bond "who's comfortably just his own game character." This is a common refrain from devs who make a game based on a license. Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-avengers-interview-noah-hughes-crystal-dynamics-e3-2019">said similar things</a> when faced with player scrutiny over their depiction of well-known heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
