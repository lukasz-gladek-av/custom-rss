The open world dislikers bundle through the door of Dr Shrinko’s office like mardy harlequins, fuming and shrieking in their oversized licensed gear. One is wearing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> brand trousers so long they reach to her eyes. Another sports an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> hat that extends to his ankles. “Doctor, doctor!” they wail. “The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world games</a> are too big. They consume all of our free time. Why, it takes Yasuke 40-100 hours to get from one end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to the other!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko leans back in his chair with a pleasant smile. “Solution is simple,” he trills. “Make Yasuke 40-100 times larger.”

<p>
No sooner has the physician spoken when the window of his office explodes. Another man clambers through the gap, straining to move easily against the friction from excessively tight, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a>-themed pyjamas. “Don’t listen to them, Doctor,” he gasps. “Open world games are too small. Why, you can get through Marvel’s Spider-Man in less than 30 hours, without skimping on sidequests!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko gestures impatiently. “Then make Peter Parker 30 times smaller.”
</p>
<p>
In case you hadn’t gathered already, Shrinko is an open world exploration game that lets you change your size. There’s <a href="https://ntesh.itch.io/growshrink">a free, work-in-progress build on Itch.io</a>. It’s the most delightful explore-me-do in a while. You play a grinning turquoise tripod who is searching for collectibles - “Stars, Bananas, Jiggies, and the secret Udders”. I don’t really understand the mammary symbolism here, but I’m too overpowered by whimsy to care. Consider: the music alters depending on whether you are unspeakably large or terribly, terribly small.
</p><p>
Some of the collectibles are found in deceptively plain rooms that harbour hidden immensities; others might require you to do a Gigantor and stomp around the skyline. If you’re worried about stepping on people while in kaiju form, take consolation in the fact that the game’s island setting is currently empty of life besides plants and mushrooms. Well, based on the 20 minutes I’ve spent in it, anyway. Perhaps the locals are just hiding. Sensible of them. Dr Shrinko has no time to watch his step. He will secure those udders by any means necessary.
</p>
<p>
The developer, ntesh, is conscious of some blemishes. “The camera is absolutely garbage, I know this, you know this, I am trying really hard, I guess it's a difficult thing to fix,” they rant and rave on the Itch page. What’s more, “sometimes you warp to the ground really fast when running off ledges.” As if that wasn’t enough, “growing near walls can quite often launch you, especially in the city”. The final insult: “this game isn't exactly optimized so there may be screen freezes or jitters”. 
</p>
<p>
Please remove your hair shirt already, ntesh! You have made a game in which I can skydive into a birdbox while jumping over a valley. I think that’s more important than ironing down the frame-rate.

</p>
<p>Thanks for finding it, <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2026/02/06/shrinko/">Warpdoor</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the cat breeding roguelike battler from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, finally saunters out of its litter box with a cheeky smirk next week. It's been a long time coming, but the developers have opted to make players wait for a full release, rather than going the early access route plenty of games opt for nowadays - the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> spring to mind. As a result, McMillen and Glaiel see the way they've gone as no longer being the norm, and have shed more light on their reasons for not picking early access.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are launching a complete game. That is a weird thing now," Glaiel told <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/mewgenics-interview-launch/">The Escapist</a>. "I’m really not a fan of Early Access," McMillen added. "I feel like it originated from people needing money fast. I’m not shitting on people who do early access, but it feels strange to change the experience after people have already finished it."</p>
<p>Glaiel seconded that view, reasoning that: "There’s a handful of situations where it makes sense, like multiplayer stuff. Other than that, I feel like almost anything else would be better." The due do certainly plan to listen to hands-on player feedback in terms of shaping where Mewgenics goes in future, but in the context of gauging what they might add to it via DLC, rather than shaping the base game.</p>
<p>One aspect that's made Mewgenics' route to release a bit unique is that, while waiting until the game's done to let folks try it fir themselves, McMillen has spent hours <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-says-the-big-important-bits-of-mewgenics-are-done-shows-off-50-minutes-of-weird-cat-roguelikery">streaming his own runs through it</a>, something he points to as having been key in keeping up anticipation as the last few years have ticked by. "If we had never shown gameplay, people would be more frustrated that they still can’t play it," he said. "Instead, they are getting spoon-fed, but bit by bit. We have fans who watch and think about what choices they would make, so they’re almost playing the game in their heads. They are desperate for another video – they just want another run."</p><p>In my estimation, Mewgenics' quirky premise and the reputations its developers have cultivated through years of putting together beloved hits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End Is Nigh have likely put them in a more ideal position than other studios might be to take the approach of making sure Mewgenics is cooked to near perfection before putting it out. They've certainly done a great job over the past couple of years of not being afraid to offer glimpses of their creation on a regular basis, helping abate any fears folks might have about the amount of time it's spent in development.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this Escapist interview, Glaiel admits that the pair "probably could have released the full game in 2021, roughly, and it would have been okay". Instead, they decided their preferred approach was to give themselves space to refine the thing, so it'd be as ready as they wanted for the moggy adventures that await when it comes out on February 10th.</p>
