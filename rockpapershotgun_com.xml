Reburn's posh-looking near-future shooter La Quimera now has a release date - April 25th 2025. Which is mighty soon for an FPS project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">we first heard about this very February</a>, though nothing to be alarmed by - it's been in development since around 2020.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Reburn are a rebrand of Metro studio 4A Games Ukraine - they're not to be confused with 4A Games in Malta, who are still working on the Metro series. La Quimera doesn't look much like Metro. I compared it to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in our announcement post, and the below trailer's worth of exosuit punching and heatvision railgunnery is doing nothing to dissipate that characterisation.

La Quimera is set "in and around the fictional Latin American mega-city of Nuevo Caracas". You and up to two of your friends play members of a PMC group "caught up in a vast conflict between rival factions and shadowy corporations, as mystical events increasingly blur the line between reality and illusion". (OK, the last part is perhaps more Black Ops 3 than Advanced Warfare.)</p>
<p>Care of a mysterious benefactor, you've got a slick mecha-onesie with the power to go invisible, and a bunch of guns that look like mating stealth bombers. The game's world and narrative feature writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn - who, now that I think of it, has also contributed his likeness to Hideo Kojima's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games. One suspects that Refn might be trying to Do A Vin Diesel and reinvent himself as a video game guy.
</p>
<p>
Reburn remain based in Kyiv, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-air-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2025-04-06/">struck just today by Russian missiles</a> in the course of Russia's three-year-old assault on its smaller neighbour. "As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry," CEO Dmytro Lymar comments in a statement.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to try those exosuits on for size, the developers are running a closed 24 hour Steam beta for La Quimera, starting April 12th at 7am PT, 3pm BST or 4pm CEST. It'll support co-op. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam</a>.

            <p>In these days of combing online imagery for symptoms of genAI “hallucination”, it’s easy to forget that once upon a time, mutant video game visuals were beautiful. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">a whole genre of art</a> dedicated to them. Here to remind us is Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal, a gorgeously scruffy 2D platformer in which an old lady explores a big magic cellar, hitting graphics card malfunctions with a broom. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, but both you and the simulation aren’t as young as you used to be.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal is the work of Jakeonaut, who is <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/">partial</a> to busted pixels. It launched on Saturday and still has a demo on Steam, which I encourage you to try. The world is made up of fizzy, marbled terrain tiles, wavering clots of white noise, and anomalous 3D fixtures. It's like the game's carcass is being feasted on by a bunch of different aesthetics. More literally, the geography also teems with critters such as frogs, crickets and chickens who can be meddled with to various end. I walloped a cricket and it chewed a hole through some scenery for me, which almost never happens in real life.</p>

<p>The protagonist is no less delightful for her determinedly low-tech method of making headway. Ah, if only I could fix my old iBook’s addled GPU by smacking it with a dustpan and brush. Mind you, it's not all flailing broomsticks. You can also learn "hag magic" spells from totems, switching between them with spacebar. </p>
<p>These include higher jumps, the ability to climb up walls, and walking on air. It’s a familiar collection of platformer abilities, perhaps, but there’s the promise of others that let you “glitch” the levels more adventurously. You can only remember two spells at once because, as a tutorial NPC politely explains, you’re old. You also forget spells when you walk through certain errors, which feels like a device the developer will use to bookend the game’s puzzles. There's a gloomier undertow: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876850/Babushkas_Glitch_Dungeon_Crystal/">the Steam page</a> mentions themes of "aging, senescence, and fear of mortality."</p>
<p>Find a demo on Steam or <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/glitch-dungeon-crystal">Itch.io</a>. Sold on this? You might also like to try <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/axiom-verge">Axiom Verge</a>. Or for something that loosely fits the designation of being a game about glitches, but has a lot more going on than that, try <a href="https://ellaguro.blogspot.com/2013/05/problem-attic.html">Problem Attic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
