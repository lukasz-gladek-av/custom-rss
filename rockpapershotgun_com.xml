            <p>August 2025 now has as many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> developer diaries as there are modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> reimaginings: two, which in both cases remains a weirdly high number. But while last week’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finishing-skyblivion-is-a-new-dev-diary-series-about-the-last-leg-of-the-oblivion-remake-mods-run-to-release">Finishing Skyblivion</a> focused on one volunteer’s attempts at getting the ambitious Cyrodiil-in-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> mod over the line, this other vid makes a very specific pitch to those whose interest may have been diverted by Bethesda’s official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, showcasing how Skyblivion looks to more aggressively expand and rework the original RPG.</p>

<p>Perhaps most emblematic of this approach is the (re?)addition of Sutch, a city near Cyrodiil’s western coast that Bethesda planned for OG Oblivion before cutting it – save for the tiny ruin of Fort Sutch, which you can visit in both the original and the remaster – late in development. Skyblivion recreates it as a far bigger, if still largely wrecked, castle town that’s been occupied by bandit bastards, and which you’ll be able to explore in full.</p>
<p>A short walk south, the more familiar city of Anvil looks to have grown considerably, its central harbour now sitting in a much wider basin with added docks and market areas. Daedric hellscape The Deadlands, meanwhile, is getting split into two biomes: one that matches the original’s lava lakes and another, stormier region inspired by the Deadlands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>.</p>
<p>Skyblivion obviously isn’t averse to making cosmetic upgrades as well. The diary also reveals new designs for several of Oblivion’s unique weapons, many of which will throw in some special animations for your trouble. I desperately hope these keep the charmingly stiff bone-janking of Skyrim, as the default animations appear to. But the video is generally eager to emphasise the more practical differences between the mod and the original, which by extension, are also differences between the mod and the remaster.</p>
<p>Personally, my interest in Skyblivion has remained intact, even with Oblivion Remastered having been announced and released in the time since this dev diary’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4">last entry</a>. This is partly because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">performance headaches</a>, and that one quest where you get talked into watching someone do farm chores for six hours, made my time with the remaster unexpectedly shortlived. That said, I do like the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting">exploding houses by pointing at them</a>. I’d ask the Skyblivion team to implement something similar, but given the entire point of this diary, they probably wouldn’t be very happy about it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/another-skyblivion-dev-diary-shows-off-the-new-dungeons-and-expanded-cities-oblivion-remastered-never-bothered-with]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We enter week one of RPS Post-Graham. The office Slack echoes like the Great Hall of Durin after a Balrog teaparty. Horace coils about the foot of the Treehouse like a sullen Viking serpent. The Maw seems peevish and incontinent, spurning any news we offer it. The wifi network keeps changing its name to "Execute Order 66".</p>
<p>It is time to smash the emergency glass and bust out a few favourites from my personal collection of morale-boosting videogame intros. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtb4uow940c">Red Alert</a>, to put some spring in your step; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">Okami</a> to let the light in; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd_6SYW2xwA">Colony Wars</a> for the WRAAAOW noise at the end. And here are this week's most interesting new PC games.</p><!--more-->

<p>As for what RPS staff are up to this week - I started late and missed the morning all-hands meeting, so I have no choice but to make it all up. James is trying to invent new buzzwords for graphics cards, each buzzier and wordier than the last. He's got as far as "polymorphotovoltaic processing" and shows no sign of showing down. Ollie has embarked on his magnum opus, a guide to Life. Jeremy has been reading too much Goldilocks and Proust and is lost in a series of flashbacks, each defined by the temperature of a particular bowl of porridge. Mark is engaged in an epic war against his neighbours, the Ice Giants, who have been trimming the hedge on his side again.</p></div>

            <p>Financial service giants Mastercard have denied accusations that they sought to influence the recent removal of adult/NSFW games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">from Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">Itch.io</a>, <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html">claiming</a> that they have "not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms," and that they allow all lawful transactions. It’s a brief and unequivocal statement, but Valve themselves have since suggested it might not be entirely accurate, telling <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mastercard-deflects-blame-for-nsfw-games-being-taken-down-but-valve-says-payment-processors-specifically-cited-a-mastercard-rule-about-damaging-the-brand/">PC Gamer</a> that Steam’s payment processors objected to the availability of law-abiding adult games by citing one of Mastercard’s specific rules.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rule 5.12.7 is <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf">one of hundreds</a> governing what Mastercard’s customers, merchant partners, and "service providers" – the actual payment processors who use Mastercard’s network – can and can’t do with its tech, and forbids any transaction "that is illegal, or in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation or reflect negatively on the Marks." In other words, a game doesn’t need to be breaking the law for its sale to break Mastercard’s rules, and Valve claim this is what allowed payment processors – potentially on Mastercard’s behalf – to push for removals.</p>
<p>"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so," Valve told PCG. "Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining Steam’s policy since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution. Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard’s Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand."</p>
<p>It’s yet another direction in which blame-laced fingers have been pointed since Steam and Itch, ostensibly under pressure from payment processors, cracked down on games with adult content last month, with many non-sexual games – and especially those with LGBTQ+ themes – getting caught in the cull. Not that these payment firms have been any keener than Mastercard to admit to being a driving force: Stripe, one of the processors that pressured Itch, say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/major-payment-firm-behind-itch-adult-game-cull-say-they-themselves-face-restrictions-from-another-banking-firm">they themselves were acting under restrictions</a> imposed by unnamed banking partners. That leaves the only organisation to have readily claimed responsibility as, rather miserably, the religious-backed activist group Collective Shout, who are probably pleased as peas that this whole thing went better than their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">previous attempts at misinformation-led game bans</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, Valve folded, though Itch have at least relisted numerous free games that were previously removed, and are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">actively searching for alternative payment processors</a> who aren’t so restrictive about handling transactions for paid games.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals]]></content:encoded>
