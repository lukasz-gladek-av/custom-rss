            <p>
It's that time of year, where the weather starts to get a bit chillier, cafes start to reintroduce seasonally appropriate hot beverages, and of course, the arrival of a new Football Manager is in sight. Sports Interactive announced the release date for this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 2026</a>, earlier today, which you may be pleased to hear is only a couple of months away: November 4th.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot of firsts with this year's version of the digital beautiful game. For one, it's been made in Unity for the first time, a fact that I'm sure at least one of you will bring up if this one ends up being a bit rubbish despite likely having nothing to do with what engine it was made in.
</p>
<p>
The bigger, and more exciting new thing is the introduction of Women's Football. While this should have been introduced years ago (can't have been that hard, can it Sports Interactive?), as the old saying goes, better later than never. A press release says Women's Football has been "seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem as one footballing world" and that its arrival is "backed by the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions set to be revealed in the coming weeks."
</p>
<p>
With this entry of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim you'll also find the debut of the Premier League, complete with licensed club badges, kits, and player photos. On top of that, Football Manager 2026 has a "re-imagined" user interface that should give you a bit more control moment to moment. It's also meant to be just generally more intuitive, for both newbies and those who've been playing for a while.

<p>
Football Manager 2026 arrives on November 4th, later this year.
