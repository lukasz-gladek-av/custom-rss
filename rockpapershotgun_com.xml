            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> was announced… sorry, hang on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">almost four years ago</a>? Cripes, time really does fly when you're waiting on the incredibly anticipated follow-up to one of the most popular games of all time doesn't it! It's no secret that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is happy to take his time with his next game, and good on him for doing so. However, he also can't help himself but continue to work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, releasing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">pretty big update</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">farming game</a> only last year. The good news is that, based on some comments in a recent interview, Haunted Chocolatier is the main focus going forward.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/">PC Gamer</a>, Barone explained,"The 1.6 update is pretty settled at this point. There were ongoing console ports and bug fixes, but it's pretty settled now. I'm committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier… I think it's in a good place. I feel very solid about it. I think if anyone picks up Stardew Valley for the first time in 2025, I'm very proud of it, and I think they'll have fun with it if they like this kind of game."
</p>
<p>
Another issue he's facing is his own work, specifically the work he did when he started development all those years ago. "It's been a few years that I've been working on it now and it's like, I look at some of the stuff I did at the beginning and I'm like, 'Oh man, here we go again. I'm gonna have to redo all of this," Barone said. Though, he did note it's not a case of anything being bad, just that given the passage of time he's a "different person" and his "aesthetic sensibilities have evolved."
</p>
<p>
That's one of the fatal flaws of game dev these days I think. How on earth can you properly reflect the artist you are now when it's a project you've been working on for years? A question I'm curious to see answered whenever Haunted Chocolatier does come out. Which, I imagine, is still probably a good while away.

        <p>Would be nice if they could just be honest for once</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">since reported</a> that between 300 and 400 positions have been "eliminated" across EA, including around 100 at EA. One of the cancelled incubation projects was also apparently an extraction shooter set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe.</em></p>
<p>
Apex Legends developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> have announced that two of its incubation projects have been cancelled, leading to what it calls a number of "target team adjustments across <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi</a>." You may notice that this language is particularly obtuse, in that it doesn't refer to these adjustments as layoffs. However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">IGN</a>, layoffs have occurred, though just how many is currently unknown.
</p>

<p>
IGN says that it believes around 100 individuals are affected by the decision, which includes developers, publishing, and QA workers across the aforementioned Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation projects. It's worth noting that one of these projects was actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">reportedly cancelled in March</a>, and IGN understands that "some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects."

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA</a> also reportedly didn't comment on how many have been impacted, but did say that they are offering those affected 30 days to find another role within the company. They're also apparently trying to help find roles for as many people as they can internally.
</p>
<p>
The report also says that Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is now taking over the role of general manager at the studio, reporting directly to Vince Zampella. Alongside being founder of the studio, Zampella was previously general manager, while also serving as the head of the Battlefield series. Zampella is continuing as group GM and EVP for both Battlefield and Respawn.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that Jeff Grubb, known for his insider information (he recently accurately reported on the Oblivion remaster dropping last week), has apparently been told that there are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">wider layoffs taking place at EA</a>. Grubb says he doesn't know an exact number, but it's apparently similar in size to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">layoffs that took place last year</a>, which saw around 670 employees affected at the time.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, the whole announcement from Respawn is predictably tone deaf. It claims that Apex Legends will be "exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play", while ignoring the fact that cutting a team to such a degree whilst it's in the midst of making "Apex 2.0" won't help them meet those margins the game is currently failing to achieve. Fingers crossed that everyone affected is able to land on their feet.
