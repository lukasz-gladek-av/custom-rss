            <p>Tabletop Tavern is, currently, not quite where it needs to be to properly scratch that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> itch. The units can be a bit flaky, charges lack impact, and there's just not enough to do to keep early battles interesting. What is it, however, is a great concept with a lot of personality: you're playing actual tabletop miniatures inside a medieval tavern, gradually building up your army across Slay The Spire style branching progression nodes. I'm absolutely rooting for it, simply because there's still so little offering a comparable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> experience to Total War, and also because it's made by a solo dev. Trailer below, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337380/Tabletop_Tavern/">here's a Steam demo</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when the world was young, god still loved us, and no-one was trying to force AI assistants into my toothbrush, Warhammer makers Games Workshop had the absolutely wild idea that building a community might actually help them sell a few toys, and so used to host regular games in stores. It's the sort of thing you have to find a club these days for mostly, but that's the framing here: you've settled in for a bit of wargaming and a pint of ale or six in your local tavern.</p>
<p>A lot of the controls will be immediately familiar to Total War players - the Ctrl-Alt-drag formation shift even makes an appearance, as do the little triangles to denote individual units within formations. Much like Total War, you've got your rock-paper-scissors infantry-cavalry-ranged archetypes, along with different types of terrain and weather. Pikeman have an anti-large bonus, shielded units are handy at blocking missiles, and so on. But it's also just far less gloomy than Warhammer in general, with classic blinding green flock mats and notably less screaming about how Sigmar has abandoned us.</p>
<p>Again, it needs some work - there's not much impact feedback, and so things feel a little limp. Plus, the gradual army building of the roguelike structure means early skirmishes are quite similar. Still, the events between battles to restore unit health or perhaps recruit a few bonus mates are a great touch, and I'm eager to see how this one develops. Between this and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">Strategos</a>, it's always good to see more games giving Creative Assembly a friendly poke out of complete complacency. Throw in an army painter, and I'm yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's soon bank holiday weekend for us in the UK, which means I'll be doing two things: sleeping and eating. Maybe I'll eat a duvet or two! Who knows. Four days with no imposed structure is enough time for things to <em>get weird</em>. Maybe I'll eat your duvet! No. Not again. Have to calm down.  I'll simply distract myself with the "culinary quest" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hungry-horrors">Hungry Horrors</a> - a game that, I must admit, I'm mainly drawn to because I'm not sure I've ever seen Yorkshire Pudding employed as an upgrade before.</p>

<p>If you hadn't noticed from all the pickled eggs, shortbread, and some sort of regional abomination called 'Toad In <em><strong>A</strong></em> Hole'? (literally unplayable), Hungry Horrors takes influence from British and Irish folklore and what they're calling 'authentic regional dishes'. I'm yet to spot my own authentic regional dish, the Super Noodle sandwich, but it's not too late. The idea is that you'll serve food to folkloric creatures to stop them snacking on you instead. Each creature has their own preferences, whether that be a yen for sweet food or a dislike for fish, and you'll have to work out what these are.</p>
<p>It's roguelikely in structure, and you'll return to your base after each run to try out new recipes. Here's a little more from the Steam page, which also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048840/Hungry_Horrors/">houses a demo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Meet Black Annis, Jenny Greenteeth, Grendel, and other legendary beings straight from Celtic, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh legends. Each creature you encounter has been terrifying the people of these lands for centuries, challenging you to outwit their monstrous appetites".</p></blockquote>
<p>Dev team hungry horrors recently got caught in pickle of their own, having to <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html">evacuate the Bangkok apartment they were living and working in</a> following the Myanmar earthquake. Given the circumstances, I suppose I can forgive 'Toad In A Hole', although just barely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Virtuos Games' remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </a>is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-images-discovered-on-virtuos-games-website">all but confirmed</a> to be releasing later this month, and honestly, even that "all but" is looking shaky. A few different <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">sets</a> of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">images</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> have surfaced, supporting rumours that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">have been kicking about</a> since an internal Microsoft document leaked in 2020. Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer said it was true</a>, and they've got an uncle that works at the White Gold Tower, although prodding Bethesda themselves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">proved as forthcoming</a> as trying to get stones out of a blood orange.</p>

<p>If you've been following all this, you may have noticed that the timing of the remaster's (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">remake's</a>?) release is a little bit, um, <em>convenient</em>. The team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a> - a full remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine - is also due to release this year. While it's obviously tempting to frame this as the monstrous cads at Bethesda n' chums taking a power-hose grade widdle on the dreams, work, beds, and pets of volunteer modders, it seems the modders themselves aren't too bothered.</p>
<p>"The real remake is the friends we made along the way," says <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912137244036522179">Skyblivion lead KRebel</a>. "This changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster."</p>
<p>This echo earlier statements made to our <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remaster-leak-skyblivion-project-lead-stay-positive">network chums at VG247</a>. "I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined, friends, experience and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry which I ended up doing," KRebel said. "At the end of the day it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all."</p>
<p>And that's the key point here, I think. The official remaster has presumably been in the works for many years at this point. Bethesda knew it was coming, and still allowed the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> team to carry on doing their thing. The result? Well, it means we've all got a more bucolic Tamriel to visit when the official version's seemingly ubiquitous 2005 shooter piss-filter gets too much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
