            <p>
Finding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P: Overture</a> a bit too hard? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you just "get good" like those randos you see littered all over Twitter. I'm actually here to say that you're not alone on this one. The story expansion for the conceptually weirdest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> in town dropped during Geoff's Onslaught Of Generally OK Announcements (aka, Summer Game Fest) as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-overture-gets-surprise-release-right-now-so-you-can-play-it-instead-of-staring-at-geoffs-awful-shoes">surprise release</a>, and it seems like the general feedback so far has been "please make it a bit easier so Twinkocchio doesn't get battered so hard."
</p>

<p>
In a Director's Letter shared earlier today from Jiwon Choi, the game director shared that the team has been reviewing all of the feedback they've received over the past few days and are "already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions." Specifically, they'll be paying "closest attention to the combat experience.

"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended. Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."
</p>
<p>
Probably worth noting that this letter didn't feature any kind of window as to when the patch might be coming. Choi explained that the video was more to let P-Heads (that's what I like to call Lies of P fans) know that changes will be coming somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p>
That previously announced update that includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-ps-upcoming-easy-difficulty-modes-have-wonderfully-unhelpful-names">new difficulty settings</a> arrived with the DLC too, allowing you to either make both it and the base game easier or harder. Feeling very thankful to have not seen any of the usual annoying discourse when it comes to such features in Soulslikes, but alas, there's always tomorrow.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have unleashed the latest twist in the game's Galactic War, with urban battles against the Terminids now on the cards. Rather than defending cities on Super Earth, this time the task is swatting bug invasions of population centres across multiple planets.</p>
<p>A tough assignment, but to be fair, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">successfully protecting their home planet</a> against the still-at-large Illuminate should have given players plenty experience of street fighting (not the Ryu and Chun-Li kind).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Massive Terminid outbreaks erupted simultaneously across multiple Super Earth cities," reads the latest briefing from developers Arrowhead, "This unprecedented assault of Fascism into highly-populated areas puts millions of citizens in grave danger. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> must respond immediately."</p>
<p>The order, which dropped not long after the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516337874624317890?l=english">latest patch</a>, is shipping players off to five planets with cities that are being overrun by the bugs. Fighting's already started on Crucible and Alta V, with Volterra, Caramoor, and Inari also on the list of worlds the divers need to hold onto until the end of this order to secure a victory.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">MAJOR ORDER: The remnant Illuminate forces have evaded Justice. Some of their remote bases endure. The unprovoked Illuminate assault on Super Earth will never be forgotten. Justice for the Illuminate atrocities has not been averted—merely postponed, for a greater and more… <a href="https://t.co/WY24mVg21y">pic.twitter.com/WY24mVg21y</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1932426600030609880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It's news that, while obviously terrible from a lore perspective, will no doubt be music to the ears of Helldivers 2 players that prefer squashing the bugs over battling the game's other enemy factions. This group, referred to in the HD2 community as "bugdivers", have caught some flak from their fellow soldiers in the past for not lending enough of a hand during non-Terminid MOs. At least this one should put that minor bickering to bed for a little while.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting the result of the last mission if you're returning to the game to fight these bugs following a bit of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">post-battle for Super Earth</a> break. Remnants of the Illuminate, supposedly reeling from that failed invasion, were the target and proved too tough for the divers to overcome.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly given wiping the faction out totally would leave the game with just its two oldest foes, the squids were hiding more in reserve than it first seemed, so they're still kiciing around on remote bases across the galaxy.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the usual bug swarm battles translate to the urban biomes, but this certainly explains why this morning's HD2 patch reworked stealth detection around Terminid spawners and places that kick out flying enemies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
