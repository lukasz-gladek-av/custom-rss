There's no better news than "game that hasn't had an update in years just received one", and this week that applies to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Despite first releasing eight years ago - almost to the day, its eighth anniversary is in a couple of days time on March 24th - and not receiving a new update in two years, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/overhype-studios">Overhype Studios</a> has come back to the game not just with some fixes, but with some new content too.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First, the new stuff. There's a couple of new legendary locations that you can explore now, the first one being a place called Abandoned Village. A simple name, but this one is apparently good for mid-game mercenary companies, and can apparently be found by "simply exploring the world." Overhype is keeping quiet about the second one, noting that it's "more difficult" and that you'll only find it after conquering the first one. Both will net you the opportunity to round up some new loot and legendary items too.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you'll need to start a completely new campaign in order to access the new content, which might be a bit of an extra pain for those of you that are prone to modding the game. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/365360/announcements/detail/536596558933657570">announcement post</a> for the update explicitly notes that "most mods will not work anymore until they've been updated by their authors". Steam typically automatically updates your games in the background, so you'll either have to disable your mods and wait until they're compatible with the new update, or revert to the previous version of the game (Overhype's update post has details on how you can do that).
</p>
<p>
In terms of fixes, there's a whole bunch that have been implemented that were "accumulated over the last year", from simple ones to typos, to rare bugs like one would occur when killing a Lindwurm via its tail with a poison-coated weapon. You can read the update post for the full list.
</p>
<p>
Probably also worth noting that the game is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/Battle_Brothers/">70% off on Steam right now</a>, so not a bad time to jump in.

            <p>
Everybody loves a good fairytale, but I'm sure you can agree that some kind of twist on a Brothers Grimm story is a bit overdone by now, so how about a game based on folklore from Normandy? Carimara: Beneath the forlorn limbs is exactly that, a self described "short and creepy fairytale" that has a look about it where I can easily imagine walking around its world and think "cripes, it smells a bit around here, 'ey?"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The gameplay concept is an odd one too: you are the titular Carimara, and your whole goal is to exorcise a ghost by answering questions using cards. How do you get cards? By finding different objects, people, and seemingly concepts around this messed up looking world. It could be something as simple as an acorn, or a creepy old lady, there's lots of things you can find, but judging from the trailer the people you encounter might not care about them all.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I MADE A NEW GAME !!!<br>Carimara is a Short and Creepy Fairytale üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÄ‚ú®</p><p>Wishlists, reposts, likes, and comments are highly appreciated üòÅ</p><p>Out on may 22th, steam page below ‚¨áÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/B8Lcn6ucXG">pic.twitter.com/B8Lcn6ucXG</a></p></div>‚Äî Bastinus Rex (@BastinusRex) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastinusRex/status/1903081759018738010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Carimara's Steam page is appropriately light on details, adding to its overall mysterious vibe, but it looks to me like you'll have to see out the right cards to get certain responses - though no doubt this won't be an easy task given that it all looks like everyone is a mean creep.
</p>
<p>
I'm very much into how Carimara is looking, according to developer Bastinus Rex "almost all textures and sounds are hand made and come from photos or record from the French countryside" which feels like a really nice touch. It has a lot of texture to it, really reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a> in some ways too. Plus it has a nice and short 30 to 60 minute run time, so I'm looking forward to this one dropping this coming May 22 - you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570370/CARIMARA_Beneath_the_forlorn_limbs/">here</a>.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> is the best-selling game of all time, but it's looked pretty much the same for the entirety of its almost 14 year run. There's an argument to be made that it's showing its age in places, an argument I won't make because I don't think so myself, but all the same, as revealed during today's Minecraft Live, Mojang announced that the sandbox game is getting a pretty big visual overhaul update called Vibrant Visuals. Now, don't worry, it'll still be all blocks and squares 'n' that, but it will be changing up how lighting looks.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals">blog post</a> explains things in a bit more detail, with one of the big things being that there'll now be volumetric lighting. What that translates to is things like sunlight shining more naturally across different surfaces, even shining through windows, and every individual block will cast its own shadow. Mobs and items will glow a bit more too, so it's not just about the overworld lighting.
</p>
<p>
This update is coming to the Bedrock Edition of the game first, with the post noting that it hopes to bring this "graphics revamp (either fully or partially) to as many devices as possible", though there's not even a release window for it yet. There are plans to bring it to Java Edition too.
</p>
<p>
I might not have much of a horse in this race as someone that only really plays Minecraft once in a blue moon (and normally swiftly puts it down because I'm not that kind of creative and I get too stressed out from survival mode), but honestly, I'm not a fan. Minecraft is inherently not a natural looking game, and this lighting overhaul just adds a touch to much realism for my tastes. Besides, this kind of lighting already exists in countless mods, so for plenty of people it's not even really needed.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there were a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap">few other announcements</a> from Minecraft Live too, like the fact you'll soon be able to fly around on friendly versions of ghasts, which I do quite like the look of. There's a live event taking place from March 25 to April 7 too where you get to hang out with Jack Black's version of Steve to defend a village in some mini-games, which'll net you a cape if you're successful. Bit less exciting, but to each their own!

Keita Takahashi is probably one of the most recognizable names in games, in no small part thanks to a game that needs no introduction, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>. That game was made at Namco, before it became the Bandai Namco we know today, and Takahashi actually left the studio back in 2006 around the time they merged, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>), the developer has shared the reason behind his departure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"I left the company because I didn‚Äôt want to be limited to only working with the people there," Takahashi quite plainly put it. "I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people. I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives. I‚Äôm currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."
</p>
<p>
Takahashi is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> at his studio Uvula, a quite lovely looking game that looks to explore disability and the small difficulties that come in daily life in his usual, quirky way. Despite working with a more global team these days, he did admit that he doesn't know "what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements" in to a T. 
</p>
<p>
He still thinks that there'll be something for everyone in the game though, as the main character doesn't want to go to school because they're being bullied, and Takahashi thinks that "this is something that happens worldwide, not just in Japan. I was actually bullied myself, and never felt like going to school."
</p>
<p>
I enjoy Takahashi's work a lot, Katamari is a game I'd recommend to probably anyone, and Wattam was a delight too, weirdness and all. Whether I'm the target audience or not doesn't seem to matter much to Takahashi either as he said: "I make games that I feel satisfied with, so I‚Äôd like people to play them if they want to. I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I‚Äôll work on that in my next life." Quite happy that he's making the games he is in this one myself.
</p>
<p>
To a T is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">due out May 28th</a>.

            <p>
I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I love <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>. It was actually the first game I played in the series, and when I did I wasn't aware that it wasn't universally loved or even liked at its release. Not that knowing other people's opinions would have changed my mind about it, I'm the kind of person that will ardently defend a 6/10, but still, I think there's a lot to love about it‚Ä¶ unless you played the game on PC. For a long time, it was missing a few things that were featured in the PS2 version of the game, but GOG's Preservation Program is adding them back in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For those of you that never got to Silent Hill 4, the thing that sort of sets it apart from the other games in the series was that you had a sort of hub area, your apartment, where you could go back to intermittently to save and rest for a moment. It's meant to be a safe zone of sorts, but after a while hauntings start happening, unsettling events like windows getting rattled, finding a dead cat in your fridge, or your kitchen faucet pouring out blood. It was a great way of keeping you on your toes, even in a supposed safe area, except a handful of them were missing from the PC version, despite being present in the code.
</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUZPtLEu2yY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
GOG essentially just switched them back on, but I'm sure I'm being very reductive about something that was probably a good bit of hard work. On top of bringing these hauntings back, the PC version on GOG will work better on modern hardware, and there's even modern controller support, meaning you can bust out your DualSense (and more) if that's your weapon of choice.
</p>
<p>
I know everyone's been buzzing about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> recently, and last year brought us Bloober's remake of 2, but I really do think you should give 4 a go. The second half is sort of one long escort mission for a character Eileen, though she's honestly a really likeable companion character - I often think about a line of hers where she says "Considering the circumstances, I guess we're doing pretty good, huh" that just feels so human in a way you don't see very often. Get on it, especially considering it's <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/silent_hill_4_the_room">only a fiver right now</a>.
