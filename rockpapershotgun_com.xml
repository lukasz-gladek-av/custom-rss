            <p>
Valve have made changes to Steam’s community awards system to discourage people from posting daft and angry posts in order to farm Steam points. You will, in fact, no longer be able to receive Steam points from other users when they give you awards. Adding insult to injury, there's a new set of awards that are explicitly designed to spread goodwill. Filth!<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
For context, Steam community awards are those emoji stickers people slap on reviews to indicate a rich spectrum of human emotions - all the way from spitting contempt to absolutely brainless enthusiasm. With community awards hitherto being a source of Steam points (used to buy stuff like profile pictures and backgrounds) there has long been a culture of posting garbage to attract a few dozen clownface emojis. 
</p>
<p>
No longer! Now, all you’ll get in return for provoking the hatred of the commons is a picture of a flaming chilli pepper. This being one of 12 new community awards Valve have created, which replace the existing designs. They are not only worthless as a means of monetising cringe - they are intended to “keep the vibes positive”. Yeah, good luck with that.
</p>
<p>
“Just as before, you can purchase these awards using your Steam Points (earned by buying games), and use them in Steam Community to show your appreciation for things like user reviews, forum posts, guides, screenshots, artwork, Workshop mods, or even directly on your buddy's Steam profile,” notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770620?l=english">the Steam blog</a> in question (thanks, Aerothorn).
</p><p>
“When we originally created Steam Community Awards, the idea was for them to not only look cool but to also grant a small number of Steam Points to the recipient, meaning they could be used as a tip of sorts for people who create and share amazing content with the Steam Community,” it goes on. “However, we found that this encouraged and rewarded a narrow set of attention-grabbing content and didn't allow the focus to be as much on a broader pool of thoughtful, well-considered creative content. 
</p>
<p>
“Because of this, we're refocusing the system: The Second Edition of Steam Community Awards won't transfer points. Instead, the goals of the system will be solely about conveying the appreciation of the viewer to the content creator, and as a signal to others that someone appreciated the piece of content.”
</p>
<p>
The new awards all cost 500 Steam points apiece, and are a mix of flavourless and awfully saccharine. Seriously, if anybody ever reacts to anything I’ve posted with a picture of a bouncing life preserver, take me outside and gun me down like a rabid dog. Still, we can rest assured that Steam users will twist their meaning. Give it a few weeks, and that bouncing life preserver will probably <em>actually</em> be the Steam user equivalent of gunning somebody down like a rabid dog.
</p>
<p>
We can also rest assured that Valve will bring back the OG community award designs at some point, once the dog of nostalgia is sufficiently rabid and ready for the gunning. I will quit with this analogy now.
</p>
<p>If we had a community award system for RPS comments, what designs should we include? Other than a rock, a piece of paper and a shotgun, of course.</p>

            <p>As seen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-new-inkle-game-a-total-war-alternative-a-paper-mario-like-rpg-and-some-bladesongs">The Maw</a>, fluffy defence shooter Mochi-O is out today, and – judging from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596670/MOCHIO/">Steam demo</a> I’ve played – is an at least passingly entertaining MIRV explosion of gleeful nonsense. Landing somewhere between tower defence, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, and Tamagotchi, it has you holding up a genetically engineered hamster-like creature up to a window and blasting waves of attackers with the mounted weapons systems hidden in his fur. Then, setting him down and giving him a good long scritch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping Mochi-O (also the name of your adopted battle rodent) happy, through the liberal application of petting and treats, serves two purposes. One, it keeps the beast sweet with your particular band of humans, his genocidal instincts being revealed through a mind-reading iPad. And two, it pre-emptively upgrades Mochi-O for the subsequent mission, sustained scratches yielding XP and currency boosts. Which is more than my cat ever gives to me.</p>
<p>The shooty bits operate on similar "Sure, why not" logic. Downed foes drop delicious seeds that Mochi-O can hoover up to unlock and improve his armaments, which escalate from one or two stick-out rifles to homing missile launcher, flung saw blades, and an orbital laser, the mechanics of which are not discussed beyond noting that the hamster can fire an orbital laser. And that’s just the demo – who knows what other war crimes the full game has tucked away in the floof.</p>

</figure>
<p>More so than a classic shoot 'em up, the pick-and-mix upgrade system and general focus on waveclear call to mind a modern Survivorslike. Which is risky, as firing from a distance doesn’t allow quite as many of those squeaky-bum, narrow escape moments that the latter genre trades in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">often to thrilling effect</a>. And yet, Mochi-O does seem to have a good grasp on the simpler dopamine extraction techniques of a quality autoshooter. Heavy waves and upgraded arsenals combine for some amusingly exaggerated destruction scenes, and the casino ding-ding-ding of devouring a seed pile is as satisfying as any SFX I’ve heard in all nineteen days of 2026 so far.</p>
<p>Crucially, it also hard-commits to its silliness, offering its daft pet combat with a confidence that’s only attainable by enjoying a deep sense of peace with itself. I respect that, in people, and in kawaii gerbil missile defence simulators.</p>
