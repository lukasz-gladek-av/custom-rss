            <p>The messy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">legal dispute</a> between publishers Krafton and three former lead developers on the game rumbles on. The lawyerly wranglings about Krafton's decision to delay Sub 2's early access, leaving a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">$250 million bonus to developers Unknown Worlds</a> up in the air, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill</a>, are still wrangling.</p>
<p>A pre-trial briefing released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-allegedly-looked-to-chatgpt-to-figure-out-how-to-not-pay-that-250-million-bonus">earlier this week</a> saw the three leads claim Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han consulted ChatGPT about ways the company could get around paying the much-discussed $250 million bonus, which the leads claim they would have shared with the rest of Unknown Worlds. Krafton subsequently said in a statement to Kotaku that this allegation from the ex-leads was "simply a distraction from their own efforts to destroy evidence". Now, testimony from Chang-han has emerged, in which the exec concedes he did consult ChatGPT about aspects of the Subnautica 2 situation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon learning that Cleveland and McGuire weren't directly involved in Subnautica 2's development, Chang-han said "I started discussing this matter with various teams within the company to find - to figure out what we could do," in testimony spotted by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-krafton-denied-its-ceo-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess-krafton-ceo-says-he-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The CEO said he chatted to various teams within the company about this, then "searched on ChatGPT to get faster answers to figure out what kind of rights we have", adding that he used it "just like Google search". Lawyers for the former Unknown Worlds leads subsequently brought up a message Chang-han sent to Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park in June, in which he wrote: "Now, ChatGPT [is] start[ing] to answer that it is difficult to cancel the earn-out. If so, this is a contract under which we can only be dragged around."</p><p>Asked why that and another conversation the CEO had with ChatGPT about the situation were subsequently deleted, Chang-han cited concerns about what OpenAI might do with their contents, saying "what I learned is that - from OpenAI, is that if you use certain important information concerning your company, then that type of information can be used by OpenAI for learning purposes."</p>
<p>Basically, the exec's stance is that he was simply using ChatGPT in this scenario in the same way he now uses it "dozens" of times a day when dealing with Krafton's usual business, as he would a regular search engine. Krafton haven't been shy about sharing how much they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">generally embracing the use of AI</a> as a business. The question is whether it's really appropriate for a CEO to be turning to an AI chatbot for help with a situation of this gravity.</p>
<p>As we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">depressingly often</a>, when company heads like Chang-han make bad decisions, lots of people suffer, making it rather terrifying to think that a technology still <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ai-factual-errors-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-b2867620.html">very prone</a> to churning out errors or  inaccuracies could now be relied on as part of that decision making. Meanwhile, the deletions obviously risk adding to the impression that Krafton aren't being transparent about their motivations. If Chang-han <em>is</em> being honest about the reasons for the deletion, it's also interesting to hear the CEO of a company this committed to generative AI as a tool expressing anxiety about what these tools do with our data.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Krafton for comment. In their latest statement on the case in general, the company said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are grateful to the court for its thorough commitment to understanding the facts, and we are confident we have demonstrated our commitment to delivering the best game possible to our fans. We made clear to the court that we were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority.</p>
<p>Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs. We look forward to receiving a decision. We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can almost certainly expect plenty more news to follow as this saga continues to get deeper and deeper into the legal waters.</p>

            <p>Ok, yep, it's one of RPS' biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>/Fallout heads, here to tell you about some New Vegas mods that've recently dropped. Why? You might ask that. You're quite right to. It's because there's a general Fallout modathon going on over on Nexus Mods right now, and I've spotted a few works released as part of it so far which I reckon are worth informing you of. Especially since next month's gearing up to be pretty damn New Vegasy, thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">a certain TV series</a>.</p>

<p>The first of these mods which have caught my eye is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94650?tab=description">Cargobots</a>, from modder Outlander3k. As you can see above, it sticks brilliantly to the established New Vegas theme of items being delivered by entities which sometimes run into peril by adding in a quest to unlock a "regional cargobot system". You're working with a Follower of the Apocalypse who seems like they'll be sending you off to scour the wastes for downed New Vegas cousins of the delivery drones which play various roles in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of new weapons to grab, and the reward for completing the quest is a remote which summons a cargobot to fly in a portable box you can store stuff in. It's far from the first time Fallout modders have gotten into providing extra means to conveniently store junk, but it's a nicely fleshed out addition to the base game's Mojave Express drop-offs.</p><p>Also linked to the courier picking up stuff as they roam the wastes is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94643">The Long Road Ahead</a> by QwibQwibMods. It adds in a set of clothing you can upgrade at different stages in your journey to reflect your character's growth and the path they've chosen in the main story. You start off by picking up your old courier clothes at Doc Mitchell's and a "Bullet Scarred Hat" from next to your grave, then find the likes of an old vest and jacket to add to this getup as you make your way to Vegas. There's a set of prototype riot armor and helmet to add to the mix once you get there, and faction trinkets around the Mojave you can use to put a visual spin on the ensemble, with all these upgrades being installed at a workbench. It's like being given the likes of the courier duster as a reward for completing the DLCs, but with a bit more personal choice and uniqueness.</p>
<p>Starting to round out this little rundown are a couple of mods which add in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92752">extra animations</a>, with one being <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94055">Taunting</a> from Intotherough, which satisfies your craving for emotes by letting you wave at or give a thumbs down to Caesar. Basically, you gesture at any NPC, and they'll react with a quick response or by getting hostile.</p>
<p>In terms of quest mods, this one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94399?tab=description">Enclave spies</a> looks like it could be fun and there's one about <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94431?tab=description">zombie cows</a> that looks plenty zany, though the latter appears to potentially include some some AI-generated voices. Whether that's a dealbreaker if it is the case is your call, but personally I still much prefer mods that are clear they've used either fresh human voice acting, remixed vanilla lines, or just plain text at the moment.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the works that've gone up so far in this lengthy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-modathon">Fallout modathon</a>, which Nexus Mods are running with different weekly themes all the way up until the end of December. So, worth keeping an eye on for a month and a bit yet to see what else goes up if you're in the modding mood.</p>

            <p>Ho there, embarrassing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fans! Not had enough D&amp;D in your life lately? Pining for the Owlbears, is it? Feeling a bit shrivelled for lack of magic missiles? Baby want some Helldusk Armor? Perhaps you will be consoled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>. It's a Forgotten Realms-themed adaptation of Resolution's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, a co-op tactical RPG co-created by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> developer Mike Booth, which is itself a homage to tabletop. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>We were keen on Demeo, with Alice Bee and Edders (RPS in peace) hivemindedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demeos-pc-version-is-a-cool-trpg-hangout-that-probably-wont-get-as-many-players-as-it-deserves">deeming it</a> "a cool TRPG hangout that probably won't get as many players as it deserves". It began life as a homely ole VR game, but has since made the leap to cutting-edge flatworld display technology. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether Alice and Ed's dire predictions were born out, but I imagine the Demeo format will be automatically more interesting to a lot of you for being transplanted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icewind-dale">Icewind Dale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> Wood and Cragmaw Castle - these being among the places you'll visit in Battlemarked's two launch campaigns, with more to follow as DLC.

<p>The game sees up to four players joining turn-based raids on craggy, grid-based maps full of traps, treasures and pugnacious figurines. Character classes include paladin, sorcerer, ranger and rogue, while enemies range from dire wolves and kobolds to giants. Going by trailers, I'm not sure it'll support the mad knock-on effects you get in the Larian game, but then again, Larian are to spell and ability combos what vultures are to the steaming corpses of recently slain paladins. There's something to be said for a party-gatherer that keeps things relatively clean.
</p><p>I enjoy the game's grabbable vinyl aesthetics, and I like how your thrown D20s physically bounce around the corridors of the map at hand. The question I have is naturally whether it'll stack up well as a solo game: you can command your whole party in skirmish mode if you're short on buds.
