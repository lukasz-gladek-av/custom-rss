            <p>
What music do you expect from a 4X game? As regards historical 4X games, I predict a mixture of triumphal philharmonics and noodly period skits, as though wandering between the main floor and the giftshop in some museum of empire. If it's a fantasy game, I think of choirs blaring wordlessly or singing doggerel Latin or Welsh. If it's a sci-fi game, I think of choirs and synth.</p>
<p>I haven't heard any choirs so far in Hard Void, though I may have encountered some synth. As regards the trailer and demo, it deals exclusively in heart-battering techno. It sounds like 3am in a club I wouldn't have been old enough to get into, when this kind of stuff was in vogue. I can picture the bouncer glaring at me. Gosh, the bouncer sure has funny-shaped pupils. Mates, I fear the bouncer may be Lovecraftian.

The trancefloor soundtrack is one thing that interests me about Hard Void. Another is the perspective during conflict. Battles see the view zooming from your fleets in the foreground to the enemy in the middle distance, following each salvo to target. It's stylised and a bit preposterous. It resists how today's 4X games generally present combat. It reminds me more of Infinite Space on the DS, and of horizontal shmups.
 
</p><p>
The presentation is otherwise familiar, with a zoomable starmap of planet and fleet icons. The menus are functional, with cramped abbreviations and some rough bits at the time of writing, like research options appearing behind other windows. It can seem bare, but there's surprising detail close-up - planets are dingy rolling surfaces with habitats stretched across them, and there are mottled 3D ship models with fancy effects such as warp bubbles. The spartan vibe elsewhere feels like a good fit for the dreary, mind-pulping music.

Lastly, there's the cosmic horror stuff. Intriguingly (and in a possible nod to Warhammer 40,000), this is tethered to the game's methods of faster-than-light travel. According to the backstory, several species on different worlds discover various FTL technologies simultaneously, ranging from the classic warp drive to "subspatial engines" and "wormhole generators". This precipitates a race for dominance of the galaxy. It also, however, risks getting the attention of the Old Ones.
 
</p><p>
There are techs you might wish not to research, for the mind cannot bear too much reality. During my brief stab at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2978460/HARD_VOID/">Steam demo</a>, I had the choice of whether to tell my people about certain cosmic encounters, or cover it all up to preserve morale. I didn't get much further than that, sadly, because the tutorial broke and I had to reload. There's also tantalising talk of multiple dimensions - going by screens, you'll be switching between them in parallel. 
</p>
<p>

If you have already succumbed to the siren call of this forbidden lore, rejoice, for Hard Void is out now in early access on Steam. According to developer jejoxdev, the game's key inspirations are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-orion">Master Of Orion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>. You can certainly see that lineage in the choice of alien races (inc little grey men and lizard people), the promise of procedural narrative events, and the robustness of the ship design options. Jejoxdev also describes themself as a physicist, which makes me even more curious about the FTL/Cthulhu mash-up here. More weird 4X games made by actual physicists, sez I.

            <p>Rude cyborg vs. immortal robot strategy sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II</a> is releasing in Spring 2026, publishers Kasedo Games have announced. For anyone keeping track of the 40K XCOM-alike, that'll sound like a delay, considering it had previously mumbled something about launching in 2025. But then, we’d reached the dying days of December and it still didn’t have a specific date. Can one delay something that wasn’t dated to begin with?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, since Kasedo’s <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/WARHAMMER-40000-MECHANICUS-II-ANNOUNCES-NEW-RELEASE-WINDOW-FOLLOWING-S#:~:text=The%20team%20is%20equally%20committed,and%20the%20studio's%20own%20ambitions.">press release</a> specifically mentions using the time to "further refine the experience in response to player requests following the Steam Next Fest demo" from this past October. There’s also a new trailer, complete with "SPRING 2026" rendered in confident steel, that rather finely details two of the playable faction leaders: posthuman battle-nan Scaevola of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and Omninekh the Necron Lord.</p>

<p>My god, that’s a lot of tech trees and skill unlocks. And the extra few months is apparently going to be dedicated to stuffing in even more features, including re-adding the Admech’s beep-boop binary chatter as a language option; this was replaced by disgusting human-speak in the demo, despite 'lingua-technis' having been their native tongue in the first Mechanicus.</p><p>"Movement systems are also being enhanced, with an optional setting to allow the Move action to auto-select when cycling between units, creating a smoother and more efficient tactical flow," the statement continues. Developers Bulwalk Studios will also work on "addressing performance concerns raised during the demo period" – I didn’t play it myself so can’t attest to any framerate wobbles, though a canter through the Achivum Redditorium does turn up multiple complaints of having to manually select the Move command. Have I got good news for those people, about 90 words ago.</p>
<p>I sat and watched a Bulwalk dev play Mechanicus II back at Gamescom 2024, and cumbersome moving aside, it looked alright, especially the asymmetry of the two factions. The titular machine cult are still about gathering Cognition, a resource they can then spend on special attacks or extending move distance, but the system’s been revamped so different units can produce Cognition in distinct ways, up to and including the humble Servitor allowing himself to be shot. The Necrons’s equivalent, Dominion, is accrued through more straightforward means (like, ironically, shooting Servitors), but stacks up attack bonuses over time, potentially turning them into a big old snowball of scowling roboskulls. I couldn’t pay too much attention, though, as I kept thinking about this wanton abuse of the original game’s OST:</p>

            <p>Stand down, great lawyer-machines of the courtly plains. Sony and Tencent's legal scuffle over alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> "clone" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> has ended with a "confidential settlement". As part of that arrow-flinging cessation, Tencent appear to have packed Light of Motiram away and pulled it from PC stores.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, it would certainly seem, endeth a bout of copyright-based conflict which kicked off in July, when Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">brought about legal action</a> accusing Tencent-published tribals fight machines game Light of Motiram of being a "slavish clone" of their Horizon series about tribals fight machines. Tencent disputed that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-accuse-sony-of-trying-to-fence-off-a-well-trodden-corner-of-popular-culture-with-their-horizon-copyright-lawsuit">filing a motion to dismiss the case</a>, to which sony brought out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-fire-arrows-alleging-nonsense-and-deliberate-corporate-water-muddying-at-tencent-as-horizon-lawsuit-rumbles-on-2">big cannon with the word "nonsense"</a> written on it.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> filed this week and spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement">The Verge</a>, the two companies have asked the courts to dismiss the case following the reaching of a settlement. The details of the settlement have been withheld, as is often the case, meaning there's no info here as to who paid or agreed to what before the big handshake.</p>
<p>There is one aspect which we can see - Light of Motiram's disappeared from both Steam and the Epic Games store. You'll not find the listing for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630?utm_source=ofweb&amp;utm_campaign=rel&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=re&amp;utm_term=1129wi">here</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">here</a>, despite <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">the game's website</a> still pointing to those links. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/">SteamDB</a> says the app's been retired.</p><p>Thus, it appears, will probably end the tale of Light of Motiram. Well, at least in the Horizon-esque guise it's had up to this point. The two great machine titans behind these games can now rest, their wrestling match having concluded in peace. Sure, a bunch of money and/or villages depending on whether you want to stick to the metaphor have likely been burned in sacrifice to the mighty beings who live on litigation mountain, but at least it hasn't dragged on for too long.</p>
<p>Hopefully it also won't result in any negative consequences for the developers on the ground, who I imagine have had to sit back and watch this costly fight with bated breath.</p>
