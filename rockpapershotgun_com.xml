            <p>
It has not been a good time for Simmers recently, and that's not even touching the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recent controversial private buyout</a> that has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">led to a creator exodus</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, for a while now, has been riddled with bugs that simply make it difficult to play, prompting Maxis to outline a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/quality-of-life-roadmap">quality of life roadmap</a> in September. Part of said roadmap was delivered yesterday in a big update that introduced more than 150 community-voted fixes, as well as some free goodies!
</p>
<p>
First, the goodies. These are a collection inspired by West Africa to use in both the Create a Sim and build mode. It was made in partnership with the Pan African Gaming Group as well as some Simmers with "with direct connections to West African countries and lived experiences across the Black diaspora in the UK and North America," according to a separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/west-african-bgu">news post</a> about the collection.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new items like an Okuta Lamp with Woven Shade, an Ìtura Cushion, your Sims will now be able to cook dishes like Jollof Rice and Chicken Drumsticks, and there's new West African inspired fashion pieces like a "vibrant jumpsuit, bold patterned shirts, and a playful, printed dress for Toddlers and Children." Neat stuff!
</p>
<p>
Now, some of those fixes. If you're the kind of Simmer that likes to make your Sims woo-hoo up a family, inherited features should show up in the kids more, like if two Sims have big ears, the kid should too - though there might still be some differences occasionally, just not egregiously so.
</p><p>
There's also been an issue where Sims might put things like books or food items into something like a Sticker Storage Box rather than their more logically assigned homes (shelf, fridge), and that's been fixed. One issue that surely tickled man that saw Sims wearing hats while in their nude outfits has been fixed, though I must admit this one mostly feels like a shame. Forcibly make Sims wear hats while naked! It's funny!
</p>
<p>
And you can comfortably marry one Sim to another without fear of any fashion faux pas, as an issue where guests would wear random or work outfits if one wasn't chosen for them has been fixed too.
</p>
<p>
It's a long list of fixes, you can check out the full thing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-11-4-2025">here</a>, which covers mostly the base game, but a lot of different packs too.
