            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3, or whatever they call the follow-up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, may have a social hub in the style of Destiny's Tower, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has told the Helldiverati in a new Q&amp;A.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I realize it's probably never gonna be a thing in HD2, but for the next game I'd really appreciate a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny)," asked one of the assembled Hadesplungers on Discord this Sunday. To which Jorjani <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1414308725400801489">succinctly responded</a>: "It's on the feature list for the next one." Goodness, that sounds rather definitive.</p>
<p>If, like me, you are a closet fascist bully-boy masquerading as a shy and retiring centrist role-playing as an openly fascist bully-boy in a videogame, your mind has immediately gravitated to the prospect of parades. If Helldivers 3 has a social hub with a hefty playercount, then it absolutely needs a parade ground. I've always fancied myself a latter-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheisskopf">Lieutenant General Scheisskopf</a>. I want to be able to turn my head and salute in synch with scores of fellow divers as we strut past the presidential podium.</p>
<p>Come on, Arrowhead, there's a proper minigame to explore here! Let the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> fill their hubs with beachballs and supersoakers. Leave mingleplayer to the hippies who play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>What else do caped brownshirts do when they're chillaxing back at base, or perhaps aboard a proper space cruiser like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rx8_vjbXX4">the ones in Starship Troopers</a>? Well, we could organise our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">Two Minutes Hate</a> sessions, with players gathering to screech and gibber at videos of squid running at a sub-optimal frame-rate. </p><p>Beyond that, maybe there could be an in-game feedback system presented as a 'managed' voting booth, with special cosmetics awarded to any player willing to take up the handcuffs, gavel and taser of a Super-Earth elections officer. Maybe player kicking framed as the denunciation of traitors? Please, fill the comments with your comparably dystopic suggestions. We'll make Jorjani rue his words.</p>
<p>The Arrowhead CEO has previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">Helldivers 3 is "hopefully many years away"</a>, not least because there's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">plenty that needs fixing in Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
