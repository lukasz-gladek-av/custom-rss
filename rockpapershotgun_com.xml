            <p>The upcoming reboot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a>, the fantasy role-playing game of British chortles 'n' chuckles, has been delayed until next year, says head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan. Developers Playground Games need "more time" to create the world of Albion, it turns out, but Xbox has offered a sparse sprinking of of game footage as compensation for the delay. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing among it. Some combat, some vistas. But it's something.</p>

<p>"We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025," said Duncan in an interview during the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8?feature=shared&amp;t=857">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. "We are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait... I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team."</p>
<p>Duncan goes on to talk over some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h77gcgE1b8">pre-alpha footage of the RPG</a>. There are scenes of the player character walking through a city, riding their horse, and fighting what looks like various fantasy staples such as werewolves and goblins. At one point the player is being accosted by a giant violent chicken, which fans of the old games will undoubtedly welcome with feathery fondness (the humble chicken is the butt of many jokes, basically a series mascot). At another point the hero is using sausages in a frying pan as bait in a bear trap. I can cofirm this is how the British aristocracy spend their time ever since fox hunting got banned.</p>
<p>Playground Games are best known for their work on the Forza racing games, which are often hyper-realistic and glistening with The Graphics. Which would be why Duncan reassures prospective players that their RPG will be "the most beautifully realized version of Albion you've ever seen". That werewolf's hair is very detailed, to be fair. But as ever we'll reserve judgement until we get our hands on the beast ourselves.</p>
<p>The Fable reboot was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brand-new-fable-announced-for-pc-and-xbox">officially announced in 2020</a> but there had been rumours about it as far back as 2017. We've seen a couple of cinematic trailers since the announcement, starring the likes of comedy actors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-trailer-doesnt-have-much-fable-does-have-richard-ayoade">Richard Ayoade</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g">Matt King</a>. But now it'll be a whole other year until we see if their jokes land.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I can't be certain, but the music for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castle-v-castle">Castle V Castle</a> sounds very much like it was made on an old Roland TR-808 drum machine or equivalent plug-in. Your ears will be familiar with the 808 even if your brain isn't - it's about as ubiquitous in hip hop as the <a href="https://youtu.be/NkU4hsaFglU">Amen break</a>. That's actually quite fitting, because this minimalist <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has the rhythms of a call-and-response rap battle. That's something you could say for all I-go-you-gos to an extent, but the bellicose back and forth here is especially sizzling, snappy, and scintillating.</p><p>

(The game music is very different from the trailer music.)

<p>You've got three Mates in the Castle (MCs for short): a witch, a knight, and a hard hatted builder. Each generates different resources each turn - magic, weapons, bricks. The cards in your hands cost resources from one those three categories, and you play or discard one a turn. Your goal is to either smash your opponent's castle to bits or build yours up 25 bricks high. Some cards boost your castle or attack your opponent's, some level up your MCs so they produce more resources a turn, some steal your foe's resources or block their next card, and some summon a giant robot with a ten-turn countdown after which it absolutely decimates the opposing structure. You could pretend it's made of goat poo and superstition juice if you wanted to stay immersed in the middle ages, I suppose. Uh, the builder's hard hat is made of... congealed acorn porridge? Sure, that'll do.</p>
<p>Very simple, very minimal, but you will get donked in the donkables very quickly if you just haphazardly sling cards like a malfunctioning shuffler that is also shit at videogames. I found a good tac was to play one category until I was out of cards and move on to the next. Spend a few turns building up and buffing, then go all out offensive, that sort of thing. The danger here is trapping yourself in a position where you're stumped into either hording resources, or making space in your limited hand for more cards by discarding for multiple turns. A few goes is all it takes for a towering bastion of victory to crumble into a ruin barely more structurally sound than a bag of blueprints and regret. When a castle is down to its last few bricks, a sign on legs that reads "the end is nigh" waddles over and then leaves again if the castle gets repaired.</p>
<p>Needless to say I'm in love with how Castle V Castle looks, too. I've started really appreciating minimalism in both digital and physical games after spending many years backing massive, billion-miniature Kickstarters and playing obscenely large 4X games. So when I spy the digital equivalent of one of Grey Gnome's <a href="https://greygnome.com/our-games/">lovely games in a tin</a>, I'm chuffed. This one is funded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>'s Casey Yano and developed by Nopopo (I agree). You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">the demo here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In first-person stealth game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a> you are a "deep freeze insurance commando" who gets defrosted whenever pirates board the space vessel you're aboard. The ships you work are crewed by talking house cats with big personalities and a poor track record in information security. It's your job, when things go wrong, to save them from their captors. We've seen a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skin-deep-the-next-game-from-the-creator-of-quadrilateral-cowboy-has-resurfaced">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-skin-deep-cats-have-recruited-you-to-fight-space-pirates">trailers</a> for this sci-fi Die Hard homage before but now we have a full demo to blast through, in which you can throw fishbones at elevator switches and overflow an entire laundry room with soap suds, useful if you want your enemies slip up and donk their heads. Just be careful, because it'll do the same to you. The demo takes about 90 minutes (if you're taking your time like me), but it already feels like Blendo Games at their most playful. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's full of great dialogue, for one thing. When two guards discuss torture options for the hostage crew, they settle on shaving the cats for information. "Shaving cats is against the Geneva Convention!" mutters Nina from behind her steaming pipes and wall panelling, voice filled with disdain for these interlopers. Later, she finds the same guards running into lethal flame jets, but their life-saving skull-gizmos allow the pirates to ressurect and live in perpetual idiocy. They try to get past the fire again and again by mindlessly jogging into the flames. "Just sneak past it!" orders one freebooter, running in headlong and dying for the fifth time.</p>

<p>The love of colourful capers extends to your abilities and the useable items (everything comes labelled with funny instructions right on the object). Pepper can be thrown to daze a pirate. Soap dispensers let out a flammable aroma that you can spark by bashing an electrical walkie talkie off the wall nearby, or flicking a cigarette lighter on. You could also save that walkie talkie for later - if you've been spotted and set off a security alert, you can call in with a mimicking bad guy voice ("Uh, all clear") and watch as the pirates go back to their stations. </p>
<p>There's a lot of other stuff going on. You can eject into space and float around the ship, looking for another entry point. A "sneeze" meter grows when you crawl into vents, and will alert nearby patrolfolk if you succumb. Step on glass and you have to take your time pulling the shards out of your feet to stop from bleeding out with each step. Bananas can be eaten for a pip of health, and the peel thrown on the ground to slip up guards, every one of whom has a name. Gladys, Walter, Patty - do not get attached, they want to shave cats! </p>

<p>Once in a dazed state, you can pounce on baddies and ride them around to bash their heads into sinks and other objects, smashing porcelain to bits and knocking them out cold. But to properly dispatch a patrolling foe, you have to pluck off their head and flush it into space using a toilet or trash chute. Combat animations are buggy and wild right now; the demo has plenty of jank to spare. But there is already so much potential for hijinks in the short span of this demo alone, I'm excited to see what else is in our hero's bag of tricks. </p>
<p>There are copious other gags in the demo. It is dense with great lines, throwaway silliness, and laugh-out-loud stylistic flourishes. I won't cheapen it by spoiling its best surprises. But I will confirm it follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a> by allowing you to slurp your foes into space through judicially smashed windows. </p>

<p>If you recognise the art style, it's probably because you've played something by Blendo Games before. Skin Deep so far has plenty of the studio's other calling cards. It's in the smash cuts between areas, the endless examples of entertaining signage, and the simple, bright sci-fi textures. The machinery is chunky and satisfying and quick to operate (when it doesn't spectacularly fail in a shower of sparks). There's even a mention of Nuevos Aires, the fictional city familiar to those who played Blendo's previous hacker heist 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quadrilateral-cowboy">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>. And the return of a cat called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e411qjs5Ll8">Chu-Chu</a>. Confirmed: this is all part of the Blendoverse. I am fully enthused.</p>
<p>If you also remember other Blendo games fondly, just go wishlist this one already. And if this is your first time learning about the studio, I implore you to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3483180/Skin_Deep_Demo/">play the demo</a> released as part of Steam Next Fest, and get toying with these cats yourself. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros are closing three video game development studios as they seek "to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy", according to a leaked staff memo from Warner Bros head of games and streaming JB Perrette. The three studios in question are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> developer Player First Games, free-to-play specialists Warner Bros Games San Diego, and Monolith, the 30-year-old studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-one-lives-forever">No One Lives Forever</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, and a troubled forthcoming Wonder Woman adaptation that has now been cancelled.</p><!--more-->
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring">broke the story last night</a>, and Warner Bros have now confirmed the studio closures and Wonder Woman's cancellation in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>. "We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -- Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones," they say. This "strategic change in direction" is "not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them".</p>
<p>As for Wonder Woman, the company's "hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." The release concludes with the rousing note that "as difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond."</p>
<p>The closures continue a terrible couple of years for Warner Bros, who have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-says-it-plans-to-transform-its-biggest-franchises-into-live-service-games">doubled down</a> on live service adaptations of their many licenses, but struggled to convince players in sufficient droves. The big recent disaster was Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a>, a handsome but creaky game-as-service extravaganza reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">imposed on a studio known for rich single player fare</a>, which has lost Warner Bros hundreds of millions of dollars. Following the latter failure, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">announced</a> that he would depart the company this January, after 12 years as boss.</p>
<p>JP Perrette comments a little on all this in the leaked staff memo, circulated by Bloomberg. "The quality of too many of our new releases has really missed the mark," he wrote. "We need to make some substantial changes to our portfolio/team structure if we are to commit the necessary resources to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy."</p>
<p>Player First Games are arguably the saddest victim of Warner's cuts - founded in 2019 and acquired by Warner Bros in July 2024 off the back of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">an initially positive response</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">now-shuttered</a> Smash Brother-from-another-mother MultiVersus, a whole six or seven months before getting axed. I also feel for Warner Bros. Games San Diego, who had yet to release a single game. But I grieve most of all for Monolith.</p>
<p>I had sort of assumed that Monolith would never be closed, because how could you close the studio who gave us F.E.A.R., Condemned and Shadow Of Mordor. It's been a while since those releases and I'm sure many of the team members have long since moved on, but their legacy is infectious. F.E.A.R. is the definitive Matrix FPS: its rippling bullet trails and gusts of muzzle smoke have become something of an indie shooter subgenre, revisited by swaggering upstarts like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">Trepang</a>. Condemned is perfectly atrocious in its Finchery pipe-wielding cellar fights. And Shadow Of Mordor is the game that lifted the Orcs out of interchangeability and procedurally transformed them into amazing, evolving archvillains.</p>
<p>Monolith's Wonder Woman appears to have been living on borrowed time for a while - announced in 2021, it had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">reportedly</a> "struggled to coalesce" amid leadership changes and project reboots, costing Warner $100 million in the process. Still, there was cause for some hope. While it seems likely the game would have been afflicted by the same live service rot as Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-mordor-studio-are-making-a-wonder-woman-game-with-the-nemesis-system">once planned</a> to make use of Shadow Of Mordor's Nemesis system.</p>
<p>Warner Bros have yet to announce how many jobs will be lost in the course of the studio closures. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
