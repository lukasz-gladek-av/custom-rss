            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> supported 128 player matches at launch in 2021. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will support 64 player matches, when it launches on 10th October this year. Some mistake here, surely? Battlefield 6 is a sequel to Battlefield 2042, and sequels are supposed to have More. If I have just given voice to your innermost thoughts, then I fear it is time to bamboozle and horrify you with the nightmare-physics of the arcane game design proverb, "sometimes, <em>less</em> is more". 
</p>
<p>
"But how can this be?" you shriek, as the ground crumbles and the walls peel away. Matter cannot increase and decrease simultaneously! A "+1" cannot be a "-1"! You reach for the whiskey bottle in a frenzy, but it is too late to unlearn this awful knowledge. Anyway, stop screaming so I can treat you to another morsel of insight from Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil. I promise this one won't hurt quite as much.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We thought larger player numbers would work - it just didn't catch on," Uchil said to Edge Magazine in recent reflections about Battlefield 2042's higher headcount, as passed along by the magazine's jovial e-buddies at <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-goes-back-to-64-players-per-match-because-2042s-128-person-matches-just-didnt-catch-on-design-director-admits-look-we-try-stuff-sometimes-it-works-sometimes-it-doesnt/">Gamesradar</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's like when a band tries a new sound," Uchil continued. "Because we like it, but then players don't - and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want." I feel "subservient" is perhaps a bit much, Mr Uchil. Please do not encourage your players to think that they're pharaohs. How many pyramids did the pharaohs build, all by themselves? Exactly. 
</p><p>
As digested by GR, Uchil added that "Battlefield players are very vocal" and will "tell you what they want" as regards the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. Definite deer-in-headlight vibes. The devs "all read the Reddit," Uchil added, because it's "the number-one source, and all of us are on there." All of which continues the well-established EA marketing theme of trying to get 2042 haters on-board with Battlefield 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">designed to evoke the better moments of Battlefield 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like thinking about how many players is too much in first-person shooters. The question of player count is obviously part of a larger set of questions about map design and size, mode design, weapon balancing, and so forth. Generally speaking, when I'm pinned down by a bombardment in a Battlefield game, it absolutely feels like there are 127 other players out there, because those artillery impacts are so very loud. 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, I remember playing Resistance 2 on PlayStation 3, which boasted then-mindblowing 60 player headcounts, and finding that the flagship multiplayer mode's objective structure had the effect of making it feel like a bunch of asynchronous deathmatches. We'd pass queues of enemy players hurrying in the other direction and just sort of wave acknowledgement, like passing bus drivers.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) had similar thoughts about Battlefield 2042. He found that it rarely felt like a 128-player game at all. "Iâ€™m not sure I notice the bump in bodies," Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">wrote in his review</a>. "Sure, things are chaotic, but the maps are so vast to make up for it that the pockets of violence remain similar to previous, smaller entries in the series." 
</p><p>
The obvious tentpole game to invoke here is Planetside 2, proudest of the surviving MMO shooters. I had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-after-fortnite-theres-still-something-essential-about-the-mmofps">unravelling PlanetSide 2's accomplishment</a> in January 2024. Amongst other things, I argued that the vast periphery of each emergent battle makes for a surprisingly good walking simulator. But enough of my wittering. How many players do you consider too many players, inasmuch as such things can be interpreted out of context?

            <p>By the great transport gods, trolleymageddon is upon us! It's the end of the line as we know it, and I feel fine. All of that is to say that two wacky trolley-related games are releasing within days of each other, no doubt driving fans of the budding genre off the rails or road.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>, a game about a famous philosophical quandary and also at least one tale of a girl falling deeply in love with a tram, pulled up at this stop on September 12th. Boarding costs Â£5.20/$6.49/â‚¬6.33 right now, or Â£5.40 if you want the deluxe edition the comes with a mysterious and possibly satirical DLC dubbed '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3550600/The_Trolley_olution/">the V.I.P. lever</a>'. If you hurry, you can probably still catch it! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Troleu</a>, a game that tasks you with checking tickets and occasionally kicking the bottoms of troublemakers as a trolleybus conductor, is due to pull up on the opposite side of the stop later today, September 15th. Make sure you've got your ticket ready!</p>
<p>If you opt to get on The Trolley Solution's tram, which is named Trolley-San, you're in for a series of amusing scenarios/puzzles based around Phillipa Foot's famous trolley problem. You know, the one with the unstoppable train speeding towards a point at which some tracks separate, with some unfortunate folks strapped to the rails of both forks, and a lever presenting the chance to save one group at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>As I discovered when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trolley-solution-is-a-moral-quandary-that-suddenly-turns-into-a-tragically-touching-tale-of-tram-love">gave its demo a go back in June</a>, The Trolley Solution takes that scenario in a whole bunch of wacky directions, including one which politely requests permission to tweet something highly controversial about footwear from your Twitter account. That's probably less of a threat if you're solely on BlueSky or have smartly given up the socials. Also, this happens:</p>
<blockquote>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough - are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</blockquote>
<p>Given the updated Steam page images feature the likes of a person pushing a tram up an incline like Sisyphus, I can only assume the full version's even wackier.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, meanwhile, is a bus conductor sim with attitude. Lest you accuse me of falsifying its trolleyness, the Steam description insists on a couple of occasions that this is a "trolleybus". I've no idea what the difference between the two is, but our Nic liked the demo when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/troleus-demo-is-for-anyone-whos-ever-wanted-to-physically-kick-someone-out-of-a-moving-bus">gave it a go back in June</a>. That said, while he enjoyed lobbing folks with fake passes out of the doors "at which point they fly off down the street like a crisp packet in a gale", he was neutral about the child kicking you can do if you wish. Here's his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>Right, now pick your transport and get on. Or, divide yourself in two somehow and board both. Or board neither and stay home to play something else. The choice, as when dealing with tram quandaries and ornery passengers, is yours.</p>
