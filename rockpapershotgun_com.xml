            <p>Earlier this week, Hideo Kojima <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">reiterated</a> that he'd really like to make a video game in space, much to Mark's despair and outrage. Perhaps "how do we send Hideo Kojima into outer space" can be one of the problems they solve in the Spaceship Game Jam, a collaboration between the Finnish Game Jam and the European Space Agency, in which starry-eyed developers "design and prototype games or playful concepts inspired by real-world space issues". </p><!--more-->
<p>The event runs August 29th to August 31st. You can join the proceedings in-person at specified sites around Finland, or participate online. There's no entry fee, nor do you need to know what "outer space" is to apply. "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/curiosity">Curiosity</a> and a desire to explore are the only requirements," the organisers explain (yes, I'm aware this website's fiendish autotagging software has just linked "curiosity" to Peter Molyneux's smartphone-chiselling abomination; no, I do not know how to stop it). I think "cosmic dread" should be one of the entry criteria as well. I mean, half the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a> on Steam are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>.</p>
<p>Why not just host my own damn spacejam, you imperiously enquire, rather than waiting for those stuffed shirts at the ESA to give their blessing? Well, "participants will gain exclusive access to a rich collection of data and assets generously provided by ESA," <a href="https://spaceshipgamejam.org/faq/">according to the project's website</a>. "This collection will include data from satellites, research missions, telescopes, and more, to inspire and enrich your games."</p>
<p>I find the Spaceship Game Jam interesting inasmuch as I'm interested in the overlap between private or public sector space exploration and the video games industry. I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nasa-video-games-call-of-duty-mars">wrote a bit about that for Eurogamer</a>, back in the day, though frankly, I think the piece in question is a sanctimonious blatherfest, so let me extract some highlights: NASA have a sideline in video games development or partnerships with developers as part of their campaign for greater public awareness and, thereby, funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</a> was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/06/27/why-infinite-warfares-space-battles-are-more-grounded-than-you-think.aspx">designed with input from NASA consultants</a>, and NASA has also teamed up with Blackbird Interactive, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Eagle">construct a simulation of a hypothetical 22nd century Martian colony in the Gale Crater</a>. NASA have also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/jedis-to-astronauts-how-nasa-tapped-video-game-maker-for-training.html">made use of educational games for astronaut training</a>.</p>
<p>As for the European Space Agency, they've <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Branding_and_Partnerships/ESA_connects_space_exploration_and_video_games_at_Gamescom_2024">hosted stands at Gamescom</a> in a bid to recruit the next generation of geeks, and are presently working with Life Is Strange developers Don't Nod on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dontnod-are-working-with-the-european-space-agency-to-make-sci-fi-adventure-game-aphelion">sci-fi adventure game Aphelion</a>. Perhaps if you take part in their game jam, you'll be able to reboot yourself as a professional rocket scientist and help poor, befuddled Kojima escape the tyranny of gravity. He'll get his arse to Mars someday.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-hither-wannabe-astronauts-the-european-space-agency-are-doing-a-spaceship-game-jam]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Romero Games have announced in the wake of mass layoffs at Microsoft that funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> has been pulled by its publisher. A number of former staff at the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero have since written on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">MS cuts</a>.</p>
<p>A statement posted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/romero-games">Romero Games</a>' Twitter account attributed to Brenda Romero asserts that the game's publisher, which it didn't name, had opted to pull the funding for it "along with several other unannounced projects at other studios".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control," Romero continued. "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome. This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with.‚Äù</p>
<p>Following the statement being put out, a number of now-former Romero Games devs have posted on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox. These include hard surface artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl</a>, senior 3D character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477302404329472/">Conor Jordan</a>, and senior producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477777308573697/">Emily Winters</a>.

<p>"The mass Microsoft layoff effectively cancelled funding for Romero Games and as a result the whole team was laid off," wrote former Romero Games UI artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346535464591355909/">Ana Mitrovic</a>. Meanwhile fellow former artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346495054519173120/">Sadbh Flanagan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346522896481034241/">Eric Wong</a> both referenced the studio closing in their posts.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>"We appreciate any attention you can bring to our talented team who are now looking for work," Romero Games community developer and communications manager Maezza Romero wrote in response to a request for comment RPS made to the studio. "I have to refer you back to our public post, which is in keeping with our confidentiality agreement."</p>
<p>The original statement closes by saying that Romero Games are "currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for more than 20 years," it goes on. "It‚Äôs an extremely difficult day, and we‚Äôre heartbroken it‚Äôs come to this."</p>
<p>"These people are the best people I've ever worked with," John Romero added on social media, "and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been a long time since the last major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> update and it'll likely be a while till the next. This might strike you as dismal news, if you adhere to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">"death by a thousand patches"</a> school of Steam early access, but you have to remember that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> is a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> set in late 14th-century Franconia, when technology <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">lolled along at the pace of a drunken ox</a>. Also, the developers Slavic Magic are carrying out a "full rework" of the game, rather than dolling things out in smaller patches. In particular, there's a new building affinity system in development that may please fans of pollination. Any flowers reading this? The next update is for you, I guess.</p><!--more-->
<p>"I know you've been waiting a long time, and the reason for the delay is pretty simple," begins <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/505080786253252678?l=english">a Steam post</a> from lead developer Grzegorz Stycze≈Ñ. "We're overhauling a lot of systems at once. It's not just a new feature or two. It's a full rework of how things like buildings, production chains, and environmental interactions function. Because we're working on all these big changes, we haven't been able to put out smaller patches. They would make things messy or break stuff that's still being worked on."</p>
<p>The developers plan to shift to smaller, more regular updates once the "full rework" is done.</p>
<p>Ever the giver, Stycze≈Ñ closed the post with a few highlights from the forthcoming megapatch. These include a "more in-depth relational system" between buildings and between buildings and the environment. They experimented initially with applying building effects across a radius, as in many other city builders, but this disagreed with the Manor Lords plot system. Besides which, Stycze≈Ñ feels that "fitting rectangular plots into circles is not pleasant, and it reduces the creativity the player has".</p>
<p>Gah, I can picture how annoying this would have been. I can imagine the hours I'd have spent gnawing my fingernails over stray wedges and curls of unexploited affinity radius. How I'd have cursed your name, Greg. Such plagues I'd have called upon your houses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Slavic Magic are going with a system of matching environment types, instead. So far, the types include Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Rural, and Urban. Buildings have affinities with specific environments: apiaries like sharing a region with some woodland, for example. There are buffs and multipliers to ponder, too: apiaries increase the bonuses that pollination orchards get from meadows, while placing fresh houses appears to proportionately increase urban affinity.</p>

<p>Sweaty questions of infrastructure chemistry aside, Slavic Magic are working on a new map, Divided, which as the name suggests has a mountain range running down the middle. They've also shared screens of new shop fronts and artisan workstations, see-through fortifications for those who want to ensure that their castle guards aren't nodding off, a new development perk card style, and a whole raft of reworked building cards. Consider all this subject to change, naturally.</p>
<p>Even in early access form, Manor Lords is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">favourite city builders</a>, and an appetisingly mucky simulation of medieval life. It even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us"><em>sounds</em> like a flyblown heap of feudalism</a>. I look forward to rearranging my apiaries.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-is-getting-a-full-rework-with-a-new-affinity-system-map-shops-and-workstations]]></content:encoded>
