<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> isn't a real game, right? I mean, I'm sure it is a real game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-producers-next-game-mindseye-has-a-release-date-though-im-not-sure-if-youll-find-it-everywhere">it's meant to be coming out June 10th</a>, that's only two weeks away now, and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies is helming it. It just doesn't feel like a real game. Take for instance the fact that the game's latest trailer, which was released today, is its first proper gameplay trailer. There's been a few teasers over the past few weeks, but absolutely zero extended looks at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. That's weird for a game due out in two weeks!
</p>

<p>
Plus there's just the game's whole vibe. The UI isn't awful, it just feels like the kind of thing you'd see in maybe the game's first trailer, but then you watch a video titled "All Of The Differences Between MindsEye's First And Second Trailer" and see how it's improved. The gameplay itself looks like something you'd see in a TV show that made a fake video game to have a character play for an episode, there's a CPR rhythm-mini-game for heaven's sake, what's going on here? Are we back in 2009?

Everything about the narration of the dialogue is generic, wishy-washy nonsense too. They just feel like words to fill a space. Sure, there's some explanations for what you can do in the game, I just don't feel like I've been given a single reason to care. The whole thing just feels like a way to spend a lot of money.
</p>
<p>
There's also user generated content that can be built off of MindsEye, the trailer boldly saying that the game is the "home of infinite entertainment", a very bold claim considering it still needs people to make stuff in it first.
</p>
<p>
MindsEye just has the vibe of someone asking a 12 year old what their perfect game would be despite not knowing a lick of what makes anything good or interesting in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The trailer did also provide a roadmap for future updates, which include a couple of "special" collaborations, more missions, multiplayer, that kind of thing. Nothing that makes me think MindsEye will become a real game, but hey, maybe this thing's the next Fortnite. Probably not.

            <p>
As someone who's never played a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> game, seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year confused me simply because I didn't know it was a prequel. I generally prefer to play things in release order, but I understand why Square Enix did it that way around, and why they subsequently announced a double remake of the first two games. The third one launched just last November, leaving 1 and 2 with a vague 2025 release window. Well, until today, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared that the pair of remakes will be launching October 30th.
</p>

While the first couple of Dragon Quests are technically available on modern platforms like the Nintendo Switch and mobile, you can't actually get them on PC. That means when the remakes launch it'll be the first time any of us in computer land can play them (officially speaking, of course). As mentioned I've not played any of them, just a series I've not gotten to yet, but neither of them are meant to be very long (hence the packaging of them together), so this doesn't seem like the worst way to tackle them.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I know this shouldn't be treated as the definitive way to play them, I just also don't always get along with the rough edges of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. These'll likely have sanded off said edges, and that's just fine with me, I'll leave all that stat min-maxing to all you sickos out there.
</p>
<p>
There's also a version of the game coming aptly titled the Erdrick Trilogy which combines all three remakes together, if you've not picked the third one up yet. And if you own the full trilogy, you'll get a, uh, dog suit to wear in Dragon Quest 1, and a cat suit to wear in Dragon Quest 2. Sure!
