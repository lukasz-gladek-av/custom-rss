            <p>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-chaos">Total Chaos</a> is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a>. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> has my attention.</p>
<p>Total Chaos started life as a popular <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos/images/revolver-coming-to-the-directors-cut">Doom 2 mod</a>, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.</p>

<p>The survival horror comes into play in that you’ll have to scavenge your own makeshift weapons to deal with a selection of horrible things, including big spiders and dudes wearing skull masks - the telltale sign of only the baddest dudes. Maybe that’s their real faces, actually. I’m not up on the deep dude lore just yet. Here are some features, via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Immersive Atmosphere: Explore the nightmarish ruins of Fort Oasis across nine harrowing chapters, each plunging you deeper into its oppressive, decaying world.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Environmental Storytelling: Uncover the island’s darkest secrets and confront your own fractured past through cryptic notes, haunting visuals, and unsettling encounters.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Crafting for Survival: Build and upgrade weapons using scavenged materials to stand a chance against the relentless terrors stalking you.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Face Nightmarish Foes: Engage in desperate battles against horrific creatures, each with their own deadly behaviors and strategies.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Resource Management: Navigate a deep inventory system where every item matters—your survival hinges on careful choices and quick thinking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Steam page also features the word ‘Terrormare’ which, ugh, I won’t hold it against them. Total Chaos is “Coming soon”. I’d say “not soon enough!” but I don’t know how soon they mean, so that’d be like, possibly a lie. I’m not sure. I’m not risking it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are War, Famine, Death and Pestilence. The Drivers of the Apocalypse are Grappling Hooks, Vehicle Swapping, Boss Battles and Upgrades. You'll get to meet all four of the latter in the video game of the same name, a combat racer from Dinosaurs Are Better (citation needed) and their publishers Bonus Stage.

If you're not savvy to scripture, or you don't read comics inspired by scripture, that intro might have confused you. Let me frame it another way: this is a game about the convoy battles from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> movies but with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>'s grappling line and wingsuit combo, which allows you to steal enemy roadsters in the event that yours starts to look a bit bullet-holed and explodey. (Dutiful aside: Just Cause developers Avalanche have, in fact made a Mad Max game, though it's relatively ground-based.) The upgrades appear to include a choice of flying drones: these you may grapple from, in the absence of any large overhanging rock formations.
</p>
<p>
"The game features a series of epic boss encounters, challenging you to make quick decisions and master your driving skills as you take on the toughest road warriors in the wasteland," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3260240/Drivers_of_the_Apocalypse/">the Steam page</a>. This makes it sound like a bossrush format, which I approve of. Mad Max-inspired games should be all crescendo. I don't want to death-race against a bunch of low-level mooks on barbed-wire tricycles. 
</p><p>
There's a plot, unbelievably. "You step into the shoes of Artemis, a junior mercenary working for Thunder Strike Force. Your mission? Stop deadly convoys, defeat powerful bosses, and survive." That's not much of a narrative arc, lads. Give Artemis a surname at least. 
</p>
<p>
Drivers of the Apocalypse is out... at some point. My snarking aside, I think it looks enjoyable. I'm only snarking for the sake of wordcount, really. I hope I can get properly aerial, take shortcuts over mountains and land on cars as they come careening around the bend. Silly wastelanders! That'll teach you to leave the sun roof down.

            <p>The demimimise of Mimimi means I'm now on the lookout for my next opportunity to crouch behind a hedge, distract a man with a stone or coin, and then choke him unconscious. (And in the game.) Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream looks like a worthy candidate. Announced last year, there's now a new trailer showing the isometric (isometrish?) narrative stealth in action.

<p>The story sounds a bit Plague Tale-like: Hanna has awoken after a long illness when her brother Herman promptly goes missing. Hanna sets off to find him, with two other playable protagonists, Alva and Sebastian, helping on the journey. That seems to be where the similarities end, mind. The camera is positioned on high, giving you a birds-eye view of your sneaking, for a start. 
</p>
<p>Eriksholm is also a fictional city, albeit inspired by Nordic-inspired cities of the 1900s. It looks like there's considerable unrest in the city, with the invention fo steam-driven machines, an authoritarian force hunting you for some reason, and something called the 'Heartpox' glimpsed in trailers. Maybe a bit of Dunwall-style worldbuilding, with yer Plague Tale family dynamics and Mimimi body-hiding? A canny mixture.
</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to us getting a chance to play this. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is aiming for release in 2025 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9">Epic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dogubomb’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-prince-is-already-the-very-best-shapeshifting-videogame-house">my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game</a>, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">house made of house</a>. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Each room harbours secrets, and it’s your job to join those secrets up and discover the mysterious 46th room - which, strictly speaking, won’t fit into the floorplan. The only constraint placed upon the house’s werehousian tendencies is your character’s fatigue, which confines you to a certain number of steps each in-game day. You can bend that constraint, however, by means of various room properties and collectible objects. Sound fun? I bring good news, then - Blue Prince is now pegged to release in spring 2025. Here’s a trailer to celebrate.</p>

<p>And here are some piping hot press release bullet points, for people who couldn’t be bothered to click on my preview link, above.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Draft your journey - Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets, as well as offering or taking resources. But choose carefully, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms one sees today may not be the same rooms one sees tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Every step counts - Progress each day is shaped by the rooms selected to draft and the tools found within them. Yet, tread wisely – when the floor plan resets at the end of the day, all but the permanent upgrades to the estate blueprint will be lost.</p>
<p>- History in the making - Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail, political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children’s book author. The deeper one ventures, the more one realizes that the past is closer than it appears.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find a Blue Prince demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Steam</a>. Got you in the mood to read about bizarre virtual domiciles? Well, I recently did a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-does-it-mean-to-recreate-your-old-home-in-a-video-game">developers recreating and reinventing their own homes in video games</a>. There’s also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a>, in which houses try to seduce one another. And, of course, I’m bound by my RPS blood oath to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game%E2%80%9D">MyHouse.wad</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
