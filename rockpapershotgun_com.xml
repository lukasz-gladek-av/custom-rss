            <p>The mutant enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The simply named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/41">Lower Mutant Health</a> mod by NexusMods user "Fredrik" will cut each enemies health by either 25% or 50%, depending on your preference. "I found that the mutants and creatures of the zone were borderline annoying," said the modder, who felt strongly enough about it that they reduced the health, even though there are some creatures they haven't encountered yet. "I haven't seen them yet and can as such not judge whether or not their health is unreasonable."</p>
<p>It's not the only mod that has cropped up. It's only been a few days since the game's release but already we have a mod that will <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/77">reduce the painfully high repair costs</a> of your guns and armour, another that lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/48">sprint for longer</a> without getting tired, and even one that introduces <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/10">slow motion "bullet time"</a> to the game. </p>

<p>It's worth noting that the radioactive sequel, for all its foibles, is meant to be a harsh and tough misadventure that forces you to make firm decisions. It's one of the many things James liked about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">his review</a>. For example, you need to decide what items you can afford to carry and what you must leave by the roadside to avoid becoming encumbered. But if you're happy to ignore the design intentions of the game, you can always install this mod that allows for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/78">infinite carrying capacity and non-decaying weapons</a>. Fair warning, this will pretty much nullify a core pleasure of the game. Here's how James described the game's approach to difficulty:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you – especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it’s done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game.</blockquote>
<p>One thing I do like, though, is this mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/52">reduces the stamina cost of jumping and knife attacks</a>. Because, god, the platforming puzzles are already shonky enough without having to take a breath between every leap. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Long before Hideo Kojima made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">the first triple-A walking simulator</a>, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.</p>
<p>Three sequels followed, and then Daddy Konami called time on the series. But Boktai lives on in the shape of <a href="https://chickenhat.itch.io/kura5-bonds-of-the-undying">Kura5: Bonds Of The Undying</a>, a non-canonical fangame which remixes the first game with one of its successors, Lunar Knights. It's a free downloadable experience, and as such, the old baked-in photometric functionality is gone, but the solar charging mechanic has been overhauled to work with an online real-world weather-tracking system. The 1.0 version launched this month - here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's some blurb from developer ChickenHat.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's neither a full remake nor a sequel, but a remix of both familiar Boktai staples and new elements that seek to recreate the magic that we all loved from the series. Kura5's weather system knows where you are in the real world, so there's no need for a solar sensor. In-game events may even play out differently depending on if you play in darkness or in light... And that's just the start!</p> </blockquote>
<p>The game gives you two characters, sun-gunning cowgirl Annie and vampire swordsman Emil. You can switch between them by playing in the day or after dark. That's right, Kura5 is designed to be played round the clock, but you can switch off the weather/day-tracking functionality and play offline if you prefer.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the overlap between between game design and the solar clock, you might also like to check out Kara Stone's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/known-mysteries-is-a-lo-fi-climate-fable-that-runs-off-a-solar-powered-server-on-its-developers-balcony">solar-powered server</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-the-man-in-the-house">Kill The Man In The House</a> is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BPLXepRC8E">Ed Edd and Eddy</a>, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPSing</a>. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Kill The Man In The House - Kill House, I'm going to call it - you have a revolver, an uzi, and a shotgun. Press F for a satisfying kick. Press Space to double or even triple jump. Land a headshot and there's a chance you'll enter slow-mo for a brief period. Oh and red barrels explode. Follow the compass at the top of your screen to lead you to the aforementioned Man, and once he's been killed, you need to get back to your car. Fin.</p>
<p>While the assassination process is similar to lots of other minimalist FPS games, I do think Kill House' foundation is strong. The controls are responsive, the guns have character, and the gore is gratifying. Also, the layout of the demo's level is well thought out, with buildings and barrels positioned in ways to promote stylish violence.</p>

<p>Really, I think it's the game's surreal, polygonal art style and how that intertwines with the violence that elevates it beyond a normal FPS to a fun, experimental one. I love the feel of being a cold-blooded assassin seeking awful bastards who have taken up residence in kaleidoscopic reflections.</p><p>It's all about the little things, like how you start off next to your car, a bodyguard with his back turned to you -  a cue to punt him into the stratosphere. And how the demo opens up as you round a corner and the sharp corners unveil a jagged valley of reds and greens and yellows, the man's house nestled in this surreal condo. Not to mention that some enemies will slide and ragdoll upon death, leaving bloody trails that act like you've constructed your very own cobbled path to the next victim.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there's no official release date just yet and that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467950/Kill_the_Man_in_the_House/">Steam demo</a> is very short and composed of a single mission. But more updates are planned, with "many features and refinements to come". These include NPCs, pickupable, stackable and destructible objects, fire propagation, driveable cars, customisable loadouts, and large open-ended levels. Goodness me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
