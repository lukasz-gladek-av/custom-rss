            <p>The closed alpha for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is soon due to roll out to players who signed up, meaning Bungie's colourful futuristic servers are warming up. Sadly, we weren't invited - the alpha is only open to North Americans. But, aha, something went awry today and the game became available to play early for those on Xbox. And one quick-witted player streamed a full hour of the game before the servers clamped shut once again. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Twitch user "bomberboyz130" began streaming the shooter today, after Bungie accidentally granted players on Xbox the ability to play too early. He played a handful of matches, most of them on a relatively small map called "Perimeter", getting into PvE scrapes with guard bots and robo-bugs before eventually escaping the map with some loot. He plays as a couple of the classes, including the tanky shield deploying Locus, and the smoke-bombing Void who can don stealth camouflage for a sure-to-be-nerfed 15 seconds. You can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2439585018">watch him play on Twitch</a> if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>The stream lasted over an hour until the servers went down and bomberboyz was booted out from even the menus. There were jokes in the chat about Bungie's death squads coming out of the woodwork to shut everything down and presumably put him in a big neon plastic bodybag (alpha players signed a non-disclosure agreement) but according to the developer this was all down to a technical cock-up that they've now corrected.</p>
<p>"We have fixed an issue where some Xbox players were able to access the Closed Alpha Playtest early," said Bungie on the game's official server. "All players with Closed Alpha access will be able to join on April 23 at 10AM Pacific."</p>
<p>So yeah, hopefully nobody needs to disappear. Not a soul here at RPS has had their hands on the game so far, like I say, but from this footage it seems in line with previews I've read. It appears to trek head-bobbingly down all the well-trodden extraction shooter paths, albeit with Bungie's chunky triggerfeels. It reminds me as much of battle royale <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> as it does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape From Tarkov</a>. The RPS treehouse is split as to whether the art style is eye-catching and cool or plastic and dull. </p>
<p>Marathon is due out September 23rd this year. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a> as a PvP reboot of Bungie's classic FPS for Macs. But its development has been troubled thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal layoffs</a> and a messy spat resulting from the game's former director being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">forced to step aside</a> over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">misconduct allegations</a>. Bungie eventually broke a long silence surrounding the game to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">reveal what it actually looked like</a> earlier this month. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>At some point in their development of the most recent trilogy, someone at Id Software apparently decided that the most interesting thing about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> was the character of the Doom Slayer himself - an odd though not entirely disastrous decision that I'd argue is mostly responsible for the design shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>. I'm a big fan, even despite this misplaced fascination with its unnecessarily fleshed out gun-numpad-with-legs. I'm hoping to be a fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> too, but based on the latest trailer, I'm still trying to tell whether they've scaled the Slayer lore back or are still banking on me being enraptured to learn the millenia-long backstory to why I'm yanking a Cacodemon's eyeball out like clogged hair from shower drain.</p>

<p>While I can absolutely do without top brass pacing around by control panels and chewing walkie talkies anywhere near my Doom, I'm actually quite on board with the vaguely modern military vibes for one reason: the true scale and threat of a hell invasion is much better felt with a front seat to the carnage these murderlopers can inflict on people who aren't the Slayer. When all you've got is the perspective of an invincible hammer, even the most fearsome demon looks like a squishy pissnail. It's just plain fun to feel like you're taking part in a war that's going disastrously for every idiot but you.</p>
<p>We're also shown a bit of what I'm assuming is the game's central antagonist. He uses at least a couple of differently pitched audio tracks to speak, so you know he's from one of the really bad circles of hell. I think he looks cool!  The contrast between the sleek if medieval future tech and the more organic and biblical looking demons makes for great art direction. He <em>sort of</em> looks like a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> boss, but art was one the few things about Diablo 4 that didn't make me want to weave my eyes shut forever with my own lashes.</p>
<p>It's not all story, though. There's a fair chunk of bulletous gut mulching in there too - although it's still a little hard to tell if the game's many combat options will flow together this smoothly, or if it's just being played by someone good. Perhaps you'd like to investigate further? Brendy went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-threw-hands-with-doom-the-dark-ages-and-its-rock-em-sock-em-robot">hands-on with its giant mechs here</a>, and then got so cocky he decided to play with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-the-hell-not-lets-slide-all-doom-the-dark-ages-difficulty-options-to-max">all the difficulty sliders whacked up to max</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ah, well thank heck for that. I thought I'd spent my weekend hunched over a screen in a goblinesque sweat-trance. No! Says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> voice actor Andy Serkis: I was simply partaking in some vital culture; a veritable Wildean sophisticate. Film industry folks thought games were "not an art form in any stretch," <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/andy-serkis-says-the-film-industry-could-not-exist-without-video-games">Serkis told Game Watcher</a>, "and gradually it's taken over the film industry, which could not exist without it." Take that, Roger Ebert's dead wrong dead horse of a dead body.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have called myself a gamer at all,” said the Lord Of The Rings actor, who also worked on Enslaved: Odyssey to the West with Alex Garland. "But I was always very interested in next generation storytelling. Around 2004, when we made Heavenly Sword, I started our <a href="http://www.imaginariumuk.com/">performance capture studio</a> with a view to create immersive stories outside of traditional 2D experiences, like cinema or television.”</p>

<p>"There used to be a terrible snobbery from the film industry with [videogames] being the lesser cousin,” Serkis said. “That they didn’t really tell stories, it was just about the gameplay, hack ‘n’ slash, and killing people". But games have "come of age" since then, he says. "There are actors coming out of drama schools who want to be in videogames and see it as another part of the palate of what it is to be a performer.”</p>
<p>I assume Serkis is mostly referring to things like the importance of motion capture tech to modern filmmaking, though I'm always a little resistant to the easy gratification offered by these "games are legitimate art now" arguments. Since, you know, they always were and you don't need either filmmakers or actors to tell you that. But also: it's vitally important that no-one ever take a videogame remotely seriously under any circumstances. Please trust me on this. Anyway, here is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/08/andy-serkis-enslaved-interview">fun Guardian interview from 2014</a>, in which Serkis reveals that he was first approached for Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword by his mortgage broker. "He showed me a trailer after we'd discussed mortgage rates and I thought it was fantastic".</p>
<p>As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 itself, I think I'm probably allowed to tell you that Serkis is very good in the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, as are the entire voice cast, as is…oh, nope, skirting dangerously enclose to the embargo here. I'll have a review up tomorrow morning anyway. You may be able to piece together my feelings by reading my last two "what are we playing?" entries. Eep.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
