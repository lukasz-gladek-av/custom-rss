            <p>The owners of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> developers CCP Games are looking to sell it off, according to a report from Korean finance website MTN. Apparently, parent company Pearl Abyss are sounding out interest from a bunch of games publishers, though no names have been named for the moment.</p>
<p>Pearl Abyss - a South Korean outfit otherwise known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-devs-ccp-being-bought-by-black-desert-online-company">scooped up all of CCP's shares in 2019</a> for about 250 billion won, according to the exchange rate of the time. That translates to about $181,139,200 or Â£134,752,675 in today's money, which is, you know, a fair dollop. You would be pretty chuffed if you found that tucked behind your sofa cushions.</p>
<p>Naturally, Pearl Abyss have been keen to make their money back. According to <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049">MTN's sources</a>, CCP and their affiliates have been incurring sizeable losses instead. They released a mobile game, Eve Echoes, via NetEase shortly after the acquisition, but this has apparently fallen short of expectations, and CCP are now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-awakening-is-born-from-eve-onlines-fragility-so-its-turning-to-the-blockchain">focusing rather heavily</a> on "web3" games fuelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">blockchain bullshit</a>. They are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">still trying to make an Eve Online FPS</a>, despite screwing this up three times in a row.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, the storied and genuinely majestic EVE Online continues to truck along with a <a href="https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility">fiercely dedicated community</a>, who are all playing a vicious meta-game of their own devising I like to call "Backstabbery Betwixt the Space Balkans".</p>
<p>One of the MMO's biggest player alliances, the Imperium, are in the middle of a gigantic operation called The War of the Ruses. During the recent Battle of Lantorn, 3,808 players teamed up to lay 306 dreadnoughts to waste. These are the kinds of losses you enjoy reading about. The ones that emerge from quarterly earnings calls, less so.</p>
<p>While I can only scratch my head at some of CCP's recent doings, I have an enduring fondness for EVE, and am hopeful that its makers will find a way to prosper - whether in the hands of Pearl Abyss or elsewhere. I've reached out to PR representatives for comment on the MTN story. More to follow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> is a game I briefly gave a go last year, back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> was still a game we were all yet to play and have a vast slew of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">different opinions</a> about. I thought the little I played was alright, but didn't stick with it that long, slipping back into the pair of comfy slippers that were Civ 6.</p>
<p>Now, though, Ara's just gotten a big update, and it looks like it should solve some of the issues that folks flagged with the base game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dubbed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507330049932791470?l=english">Living Strategy update</a>, this revamp's the first step in a roadmap for the game that was laid out when Stardock Entertainment took the lead on Ara's continued post-launch additions from original developers Oxide Games. It looks like it'll make Ara a bit less frustrating to play.</p>
<p>For example, the revamp takes its name from the default view being switched to a new "Living Strategy" middle ground that aims to balance the up-close perspective on the stuff you're building with the wider strategic overview you'll want when making bigger moves, meaning you should be able to do everything from one perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the patch addresses two of the biggest issues that Sin Vega flagged in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">our review of Ara</a> - the sheer amount of micromanagement required to manually equip buildings and citizens with the stuff from your inventory they need to accomplish certain tasks, and your AI opponents being too easy to outfox.</p>
<p>Now, you've got the option to automate resource selection or control it through policies, meaning you should get less bogged down in just making sure your cities don't grind to a halt. Stardock say AI leaders will "make more nuanced decisions, better optimize their resources and challenge players with deeper strategic considerations", in an effort to ensure you actually face a challenge down the stretch in games.</p>
<p>Skirmishes between you and the likes of bot Otto von Bismarck will feature a new "battle viewer panel" designed to explain fight outcomes and strats more clearly as part of a wider combat overhaul, and map's been upgraded to try and provide more variety in starter setups. Along with those additions and redesigns, Stardock's had a go at making the game run better graphically, gameplay flow more smoothly, and squashed some bugs.</p>
<p>So, maybe worth checking out if you're not happy with where Civ 7's currently at in its own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-next-update-will-make-food-actually-worth-investing-in-and-let-you-play-forever-if-youve-got-that-long">ongoing update metamorphosis</a>, and crave the chance to play dictator/benevolent overlord/person who tells virtual people what to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
