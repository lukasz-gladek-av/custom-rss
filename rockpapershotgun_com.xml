Saber and Focus Entertainment Publishing have announced Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3, another bloody serving of Adeptus Astarting with a fresh single player campaign and multiplayer component, plus unspecified "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games". Saber will work on the new action game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which they assure us will continue to receive updates for "years".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The press release in question is crammed to the visor with talk of "new heights" and suchlike, but does not, alas, contain any real details about Space Marin3, or any images beyond some key art depicting Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first two games. Still, it seems safe to say that he'll be taking his chainsword to a different bunch of marauding aliens and heretics in the threequel. The first Space Marine was all about Orks and Chaos, the second one was Tyranids and Chaos. Maybe the Drukhari and Chaos next time? Possibly the T'au Empire? I've heard they're actually quite nice.
</p>
<p>
The line about "redefining the standards of third-person action" is from John Bert, Focus Entertainment Publishing's deputy CEO. There's also some chinwaggery in the release from Saber SEO Matthew Karch, who notes that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">well-wrought</a> and best-selling Space Marine 2 has been "transformative" for Saber, a company that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">until recently languished in the claws of cheery job-loss merchants Embracer</a>. "While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment," Karch writes. 
</p>
<p>
The release concludes with the note that parent company Pullup Entertainment (previously Focus Entertainment - I guess they've decided they need to hit the gym more often) have a revenue announcement on April 17th 2025. Perhaps we'll hear more about Space Marine 3 then. 

</p>
<p>Any hopes to share at this point? I would like a more knowing take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">the Imperium's fascism</a>. I would also like Titus to get himself all chopped up and converted into a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreadnought">Dreadnought</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teardown">Teardown</a> is one of those games that's just fun to look at, with all of its completely destructible voxel environments. When it first got announced it kind of reminded me of those old Flash games where you had simple creatures you could shake around and chuck stuff at, the joy of it being to see how far you could push things.</p>
<p>Messing around like that is all the better with friends though, I reckon, and would you look at that, developer Tuxedo Labs have just announced today that a multiplayer update is on the way to the sandbox game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As shared in a press release, it's not just a simple matter of being able to bust up buildings to you and your friends' hearts' content, as there'll be campaign co-op, competitive, and sandbox modes in what's described as the game's "largest update" yet. All you have to do is check the Teardown subreddit to see how highly requested a feature multiplayer is. There was even a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeardownGame/comments/rsbf1v/teardown_multiplayer_has_been_released/">multiplayer mod released a few years back</a>, so this will be welcome news I'm sure.

<p>
The multiplayer update will launch initially through the game's Experimental Branch on Steam, and the team will be looking for feedback. Modders might be especially inclined to give it a go, as additions to Teardown's API are planned for around the same time to help people update existing mods to work in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date in sight for the multiplayer update, not even a release window, just a promise that it's "coming later this year." Teardown's been on my list to pick up pretty much since it came out, just one of those games that got away from me, but the opportunity to cause a little bit of destructive mischief with some friends sounds pretty appealing right now.

I'm often put off by gimmicky horror games, but sometimes I see one and think "yeah, that'll be a laugh." This time around it's Eyes Never Wake, the debut survival horror from developer Allan Hedlund. Where some horror games in recent years have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shout-your-dogs-name-into-your-microphone-to-find-him-in-this-horror-game">used your microphone to track how loud you're being</a>, Eyes Never Wake uses your webcam to track whether your face is present or not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Eyes Never Wake, the monster that's trying to hunt you down can't see you if your face isn't visible on screen. The trailer quite cleverly shows this by smoothly cutting from gameplay to real world footage of the player ducking down to hide from the incoming threat.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
It's quite obvious the game takes some cues from modern creepypastas like The Backrooms, and I think the monster design itself is a bit generically naff, but I do think the idea of slamming my head into my desk just to avoid being spotted is pretty funny. It's sort of like an evil but less emotionally devastating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-story-game-is-controlled-by-blinking-into-your-webcam">Before Your Eyes</a>.
</p>
<p>
You might ask "can I not just turn my webcam away so the monster can never see me", to which the game answers, "no, because there are doors that require in-world facial recognition scans in order to open them" - and it <em>also</em> uses your microphone, so it might hear you anyway. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer doesn't reveal much about what Eyes Never Wake involves beyond the cam-ducking idea, so I can only hope it also has things like well-designed layouts and decent pacing. Mostly, though, I'm just excited by a dev playing with the medium while considering the real, physical presence of a player.
</p>
<p>
No word on a release date, but if you're into this game that YouTubers like Markiplier are guaranteed to play, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526200/Eyes_Never_Wake/">wishlist it here</a>.
