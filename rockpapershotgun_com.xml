            <p>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-pc-review">the 2016 launch version No Man's Sky</a>, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it's only getting more and more, er, infinite.</p>

<p>In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s Worlds Part 2 update, there is talk of adding "billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets" to a game that already harbours more worlds than any mortal player community could ever explore, including new, somehow walkable gas giants that are "ten times bigger than our biggest planet". Also oceans so deep you can't see the sun. Please excuse me, I think my thalassophobia and agoraphobia have fused into a single sprawling fear of literally everything, "literally everything" being the title of a hypothetical No Man's Sky's update in, oh, let's say 24 months' time. Find a video below with commentary from Hello Games managing director Sean Murray.</p>

<p>Let me attempt to zoom from the terror of the macrocosm to the pleasantries of individual exploration and survival. The gas giants look a bit spesh, don't they? Going by the trailer, you'll be walking on their hard rocky cores or perhaps, hopping around on fragments of solid matter launched into their upper atmospheres. I assume they've wrangled with the problem that the gravity ought to render you two-dimensional. It predictably reminds me of Giant's Deep in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, which always used to make my knees dance a nervous jig whenever I'd fly through the clouds. The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/">official patch notes</a> may reveal more - they weren't live at the time this was written.</p><p>As for the deeper oceans, this is definitely making inroads on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>'s turf, though existing No Man's Sky oceans are pretty voluminous and atmospheric already. I am always glad to swim amongst dangling sacks of kelp. Please do not eat me, semi-randomised abyssal critters.</p>
<p>The video makes fleeting mention of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, Hello Games's forthcoming fantasy roamabout,  which takes place on one, Earth-sized planet. I continue to like that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-studio-hello-games-unveil-light-no-fire-a-fantasy-survival-game-set-on-a-single-huge-planet">puckish Carrollian stylings</a>, and letting the designers and artists focus on a single, albeit vast landscape could have interesting ramifications, but the more they flesh out No Man's Sky, the harder it is to see what Light No Fire really brings to the party. Hopefully we'll get a proper demo soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.</p>
<p>The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2792340/Microtopia_Demo/">demo</a> as well? Catch the trailer below.

I like the simultaneously brain-tickling and skin-crawling presentation, which reminds me a little of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darwinia">Darwinia</a>. I also appreciate the developer's chutzpah in leapfrogging the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth">surprising amount</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-the-ants">of competition</a> in the ant-based strategy genre, which extends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scientists-use-age-of-empires-2-to-investigate-how-ants-wage-war">scientists using Age Of Empires to monitor how ants "wage war"</a>. These ain't just your regular garden-variety formicidae - they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/zachtronics">Zach</a>-ass cyborgs. Amongst other things, you can "optimize your layout by using sensors and logic gates to sort your ants based on different properties".
</p><p>
I wonder if it'll be one of those games where you can build a functioning computer inside the simulation. Mind you, it also sounds like a traditional strategy game campaign in places, with a bunch of biomes to visit as you rear new queens and send them off to colonise the setting's "world of electronic waste".</p>
<p>
Here are some bullet points from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2750000/Microtopia/">Steam page</a>. Read them quickly before they scuttle away.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- 30 different ant castes
</p>
<p>
- 45 buildings to construct
</p>
<p>
- 7 different types of trails
</p>
<p>
- 10 logic trails and gates to sort your ants
</p>
<p>
- 5 biomes to explore
</p>
<p>
- 44 material types to find and craft
</p>
<p>
- 3 full tiers of progression, each with their own missions
</p>
<p>
- 80 objectives to achieve
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to work out the implications of Cordyceps naming themselves after a fungus celebrated for turning ants into zombies. Are they secretly the game's bad guys? Can a robot succumb to parasitic mushrooms?
