            <p>Quick, the world is in peril, your adopted daughter is under threat, and nearby villagers are being terrorised by monsters. What do you do? Oh, you're sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You're playing a card game with a dude called "Aldert". The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you're just sitting there. Playing another "cow" card. Okay.</p>
<p>Guess you'll be happy to learn that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">recently trailered</a> Ciri-led sequel. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/cd-projekt-knows-why-were-all-really-here-gwent-is-coming-back-in-the-witcher-4-and-the-devs-dont-think-anyone-will-be-disappointed/">PC Gamer</a>, two developers at CD Projekt Red responded to a recent interview question about the in-universe card game with some confidence, saying: "I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"We really love the game," said executive producer Gosia MitrÄ™ga in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmbhFPninuw?feature=shared&amp;t=637">interview with Easy Allies</a>. "And we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love... But I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"Yeah for sure," added game director Sebastian Kalemba. "It's a part of the experience, so absolutely. We also love Gwent."</p>
<p>It was perhaps a no-brainer that the card game be revived for the sequel, considering it was popular enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">free-to-play multiplayer spin-off</a> and a standalone singleplayer adventure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>. Both of which, as card games, were pretty solid. </p><p>Gwent as it originally appeared in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> was inspired by physical card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112/condottiere">Condottiere</a>, with a few differences in both visuals and rules to make it fit into the world of the cat-eyed freelancers and sneaky bog witches. The multiplayer version, meanwhile, has mutated from its original design throughout the years, to the extent that any time I've booted it up I find have no idea how best to use my cards anymore. I'm interested to see exactly what form it'll take in the Witcher 4, and if my wintry tactic of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-annoying-thing-i-like-to-do-in-gwent">covering the board in frost</a> will once again be viable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
