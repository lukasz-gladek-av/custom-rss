            <p>Brutal boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s first major post-release patch has arrived today, February 13th. Among its array of tweaks is a "partial" fix for a pretty serious issue - it sometimes being impossible for your character to down any healing elixirs in battle.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not difficult to imagine such an occurrence being a source of serious frustration in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a>, far, wherever you are, but if you had any doubts Sherif from our network mates <a href="https://www.vg247.com/nioh-3-patch-1-03-01-elixir-healing-bug-crash-fixes">VG247</a> has personally testified as much in pointing out the fix. I'd have asked our very own Jeremy to get double verification on this, however, knowing that the game pushed him to the point that he put a hole in his desk while playing it for review, I've decided to spare him the displeasure of having to recall any points when his healing abilities might have gone AWOL.</p>
<p>Beyond that and a bunch of other fixes - some of which are for specific bugs affecting bosses like Takasugi Shinsaku, Minamoto no Yoritomo, and Kajiwara Kagetoki - Koei Tecmo have made some broader adjustments to the game with this patch, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3681010/view/565900410925088838?l=english">version 1.03.01</a>. They've "greatly increased the Health of enemies in the Training Ground Battle Scroll and made it possible to pray at the shrine during battle" and "made changes so a backup copy of save data will be automatically generated when the player loads save data".</p>
<p>Personally, my favourite not from the patch is this one: "Fixed an issue where if the player selected 11, 32, 33, or 43 under Base Hair in Character Creation, they would be able to select 14 under "Hair - Back of Head (Top)" even if the hair was floating above the head." Begone, misbehaving trims.</p><p>Despite the toll it took on his furniture, Jeremy opted to give Nioh 3 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-review-a-superb-blend-of-soulslike-splendour">a bestest best</a>. "Wonky performance aside, Nioh 3 is excellent," he wrote. It's not as elegant and practiced as FromSoftware's efforts, and I daresay that the creativity present in recent Chinese soulslikes like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> isn't matched here either. But it still warrants a Bestest Best, because what this game does do is deftly borrow from modern titles in a variety of genres, mingling their flavours into one delicate Miso soup. There's a word in Okinawan - chanpurū - which means to mix together. That's what Nioh 3 is - a chanpurū of influences that manages to entertain in a wonderful fashion. Even if you're biased against samurai like I am, it's still worth your while to fire this one up, tackle the Crucible, and cuddle a Chijiko or three."</p>

            <p>I wasn’t immediately sure who the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">Steam client beta update</a>, which allows Steam review writers to optionally attach their hardware specs and anonymised framerate data, was for. The reviewers? Not unless they want to inadvertently reveal that the reason they aren’t getting 360fps in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is because they’re trying to run it on a 3DFX Voodoo Banshee. Developers? Performance data could be useful but if I ran a QA department, I’d want that coming from observable tests, not from the bottom of a slur-filled missive from ViperSniper69 (0.2hrs on record).</p>
<p>Then I read the words "This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS," and realised: this is for Valve themselves. A devious ploy to record how thousands of hitherto unbenchmarked games run on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and, eventually, the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Don’t try denying, Gabe and company. The smoking patch note lies further down: "When submitting feedback on whether you agree with a Deck Verified rating, if you disagree we'll now ask for the reason." The Steam Deck Verified programme, huh? Like that of the – and you can’t see, but I’m about to pull back a large ruched curtain – <em><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">Steam Machine Verified programme</a>?</em> You may be gaining access to countless reams of performance and system data, Valve, but I’m the one who knows your game.</p>
<p>This isn’t even the first Steam patch of 2026 to prepare for the upcoming, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">if moderately delayed</a>, Linux gamesbox. Less than a month ago, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/541128612120625572">a huge pile</a> of Steam Input and Big Picture Mode fixes and improvements was unsubtly dumped into the launcher, a brazen show of strength for the Machine’s intended controller support. Analysing game performance? Enabling third-party peripherals as well as the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>? Christ, the depths some people would sink to.</p><p>There are other possibilities here, like helping smaller developers identify tech issues or letting players with similar hardware to a reviewer see how a game might run. Unfortunately, I’ve decided they’re all nonsense, in favour of the Steam Machine thing.</p>

            <p>Edwin, come look at this! Seriously, come look at this! It's that thing from your site bio. They're doing a new one. Edw-0h wait, he's on holiday today. Ah well, I guess I'll have to aim my distictly non-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> enthusiast eyes at Legacy of Kain: Ascendance. Ooh, Edwin, this nice marketing person claims it'll appeal to veteran Kainers like you, despite being a bit of a new direction for the series.</p>

<p>This is new and therefore special, but this is also old and therefore special is essentially the driving point made by an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/12/legacy-of-kain-ascendance-new-stylistic-direction/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by Legacy of Kain: Ascendance lead writer Claribel Guerra. The game, a 2D action platformer revealed by Crystal Dynamics during last night's PlayStation State of Play, is the first new Legacy of Kain since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Defiance, as it happens, is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-defiance-is-getting-a-proper-remaster-includes-a-demo-of-a-never-before-seen-canceled-game">getting a remaster next month</a>.</p>
<p>In Ascendance, you play as Kain, Raziel, and Elaleth - the former two voiced by returning voice actors Simon Templeman and Michael Bell. The game itself's a weird mishmash. "Ascendance’s 2D side-scrolling presentation and pixel art aesthetic immediately stand out, evoking the era when the series first emerged," Guerra wrote. "That approach is paired with PS1-era-inspired 3D sequences and anime-influenced cinematics, bringing major story moments to life while nodding to the franchise’s first leap into 3D with Soul Reaver. The experience centers on combat and atmosphere, challenging you to master movement, read enemy patterns, and stay in control under pressure."</p><p>While there doesn't look to have been many specifics of the story yet, Guerra insisted that "the world remains bleak and oppressive; the themes are heavy with fate, power, and consequence". "The game’s narrative unfolds across multiple eras, connecting familiar characters and moments from the series’ history while expanding on ideas that were previously only implied," they added.</p>
<p>So, they assert, old heads won't be put off by the upping of pace in terms of actions. You'll still be stopping to figure stuff out and take in key happenings, rather than locked in a constant rush.</p>
<p>Will that actually appeal to clapped-out Soul Reaver enthusiasts like my dear vaycaying colleague? We'll find out when Legacy of Kain: Ascendance comes out on March 31st this year. Or just whenever Edwin's back in. Either way, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4233530/Legacy_of_Kain_Ascendance/">Steam</a>.</p>
