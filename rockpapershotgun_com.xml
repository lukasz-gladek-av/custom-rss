It's been a little over a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palia">Palia</a> had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today. This update is mostly focused on a new area, the titular Elderwood, and it'll be free for everyone. That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient).

<p>
Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now.

You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a "new equipment system that buffs you and your party." On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a>, so, no complaints here!
</p>
<p>
The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/runescape-returns-as-an-open-world-survival-rpg-in-which-you-hunt-a-dragon-queen">just a couple of weeks ago</a>, and today developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/jagex">Jagex</a> hosted a livestream where they showed a deep-dive of the game and revealed the game's release date. Turns out, it's today! As in right now, today, as in you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">go to Steam to buy the game in early access</a> if that's something you'd be interested in.

This'll be quite a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> experience than you might be used to, though, as this spin-off from the long-running MMO is one of those open world, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, survival crafting kind of games. The Steam page makes it clear that the game is still "RuneScape at its core", as you'll have quests to venture out on, magic to use to craft homes and fight enemies, and there's even some "light RPG elements" too.

It's still a multiplayer experience too, as up to four of you can play together as you set out to slay the Dragon Queen. Oh, yeah, dragons aren't your friends unfortunately, you have to kill them, which I suppose is the traditional thing to do to the scaly creatures. Overall, it looks something akin to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, albeit with that general RuneScapey vibe.
</p>
<p>
In a press release Jagex said they're planning regular updates for the game, with a big focus on "listening closely to the community" - hence the early access release, I suppose. I'm not entirely convinced by how the game looks just yet, I think it'll need a bit more of a hook than multiplayer survival crafting game, but it's RuneScape. The genre's just a bit too saturated these days. I like the sound of there being quests rather than just self-directed play as many games of its ilk tend to be, fingers crossed Jagex leans into that a bit to help Dragonwilds stand out.
