        <p>"There are many things we can't do to change the world," says Microsoft's Brad Smith</p>

            <p>A group of current and former Microsoft employees have staged a sit-in protest in the office of company president Brad Smith over the use of Azure and generative AI technologies by the Israeli military during their on-going bombardment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766324/microsoft-building-34-lockdown-protesters-brad-smith-office">The Verge</a>, the protestors belonged to the No Azure for Apartheid activist group, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">continues to petition Microsoft</a> to terminate all of their contracts with the Israeli government and military. Microsoft president Brad Smith claimed in a subsequent press briefing that the group of protestors consisted of seven people, with two being current Microsoft staff, and were removed from the office by Redmond police.</p>
<p>No Azure for Apartheid organizer and former Microsoft employee Abdo Mohamed confirmed to The Verge that Microsoft staffers Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were part of the protest, alongside former staff Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez.</p>
<p>Following the protest, Smith staged a press briefing in his office, declaring that Microsoft are "committed to ensuring [their] human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East." "When seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office, plant listening devices — even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cellphones hidden under couches and behind books — that’s not ok. When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok," the exec said. Smith complaining about the planting of listening devices seems rather ironic, given that Microsoft stand accused of collaborating with Israeli military efforts to keep Palestinians under surveillance.</p>

<p>When asked whether the two current Microsoft workers who were part of the sit-in, which was livestreamed on Twitch, will face any internal disciplinary measures for doing so, Smith said the following:</p>
<blockquote>We'll take a look. I think one or two of them may have also been arrested last week. So, if somebody's been arrested twice, that's a situation that is not standard employee conduct I think it's fair to say. I don't think it would be regarded as standard employee conduct by any of the places where you [gestures to media present] work, [or] frankly any of the places where anybody works.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the briefing, Smith addressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">The Guardian's recent report</a> about Microsoft's Azure cloud platform being used in the surveillance of Palestinians by Israel, saying that Microsoft are investigating the report's allegations. "We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will," he said.</p><p>He also touched on Microsoft having contacted the FBI in April this year, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-26/microsoft-asked-fbi-for-help-with-israel-gaza-protests?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) reporting that the company had asked the body to provide information on pro-Palestinian protests that might target Microsoft. The exec said he'd first heard about this last week, and subsequently cited "one of our security folks" as having sent the email to the "local FBI office", claiming that it was a more general inquiry about "disruptions" the FBI could see potentially being planned in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>This latest protest comes as groups like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement</a> continue to call for people to boycott Microsoft and Xbox products over the company's relationship with the Israeli miliary, with unionised staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane Studios recently having <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arkane-studios-union-publishes-open-letter-to-microsoft-demanding-a-stop-to-israeli-support">voiced their support</a> for both the BDS boycott and No Azure for Apartheid's efforts.</p>

        <p>Folks' Lasombra and Toreador feedback has been heard</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox look like they might be sticking a stake in their rather unpopular plans to sell two of the game's vampire clans as paid day-one DLC. I say "might be" because nothing specific's been committed to yet, beyond some nebulous making of "adjustments ahead of launch" in response to fan feedback on the gating-off of Lasombra and Toreador bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">these two clans being packed away</a> into the £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 coffin of Bloodlines' Shadows and Silk DLC pack, it came right as the long-in-the-works RPG got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">fresh trailer and what should hopefully be its final release date</a>. The only ways to get the clans were to buy that pack on top of the base game, or splash out £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 for the premium edition.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1410005970746347633">Bloodlines 2 Discord</a> last night, World of Darkness community developer DebbieElla emerged from the shadows with what looks like the first inkling of an impending change. "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we’re making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this," she wrote. "We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>That was it, aside from a line promoting a livestream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/worldofdarkness">World of Darkness' Twitch channel</a> at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM ET today, August 27th, which I only mention here in case it turns out to be the place Paradox share that promised info.</p>

<p>Up to this announcement, Paradox and Bloodlines developers The Chinese Room had been sticking by the call to paywall the two clans. Our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">grilled them about it at Gamescom</a>, and the response was along the lines of the Toreador and Lasombra being additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game, so therefore fine to charge extra for.</p><p>"We've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like, including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it," Bloodlines 2 narrative director Ian Thomas told us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, project design director Jey Hicks insisted that this 'extra' stuff is "not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in". We'll have to see what these promised "adjustments" look like, but a complete u-turn would rightly miff folks who've already pre-ordered the premium edition because it includes these extra clans. We'll let you know when Paradox reveal exactly how they're pulling their feet out of all this deathhound doo-doo.</p>
