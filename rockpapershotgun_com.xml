            <p>
In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>
"Superbesque!" I breathed, watching myself casually tear off a violin solo to magic open a door. "Magnifissimos!" I sang, watching myself artfully bounce my violin bow off the floor and catch it to double-jump. "Bravanche!" I honked, watching myself evaporate against some spikes. While it's not a metroidvania, the cavernous, lamplit, whirring set-dressing puts me strongly in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and the eternally-forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Here's a trailer:

<p>
And here's some backstory: the aforementioned very fancy violinist is Philemon, who must gather the members of an orchestra and restore vitalising music to a world that has fallen into deathly silence. The levels and backdrops are a phantasmagoric, almost Cubist portrayal of instruments collapsed together into halls and shafts - I am keen to see more of them. Hollow Knight aside, it all reminds me just a little of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and Oddworld, which probably aren't the parallels developers Sunny Peak are going for. I mean, I assume there isn't an abbatoir level, but perhaps that's where they get all the catgut. </p>
<p>"Each area in Symphonia has its own distinct feel and characters, and each room is hand-crafted," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865960/Symphonia/">the Steam page adds</a>. "Meet prodigious musicians and try to convince them to join the orchestra."
</p>
<p>
And then there's the score, a bespoke piece of classical romance music, written by composer Olivier Esman and his partners Alexandre Bucas-Français and Lou Corroyer. As regards the demo, at least, it's gently synched to your progress, with certain actions triggering the next movement. You'll also perform full-arsed concerts at intervals that are dedicated to a particular section of the orchestra - Strings, Brass and Woodwinds. I deduce from this that the game has a three-act structure.
</p>
<p>
Symphonia is out... now! And feels like a good festive pick if your idea of festive is a soothing melange of velvet, mahogany and candlelight. And spike pits. Here's some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYN1d3f2dc">Disney's Fantasia</a> to wash it all down.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/short-trip-browser-game">First covered by Alice O</a> (RPS in peace) in 2017, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Short Trip</a> was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it's out on Steam. Not only that, it's arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added "scheduled mode" that adds more charm to an already lovely game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hand-drawn "over five years", Short Trip is the work of developer Alexander Perrin. And in it, you use the left and right keys to drive a tram across a sketched mountainscape. As you trundle past trees and nice cottages, you'll drop off cat passengers and pick up new ones. There's no ultimate aim here, besides chilling out, absorbing the wonderful aesthetics, and feeling more zen once you've had your fill.</p>

<p>The new "Scheduled" mode syncs up with your computer's clock to create a "tram timetable". This means you'll need to reach each station at the right time, with a view to chasing a high score. I imagine this takes away a little of the zen, but then again, nobody's forcing you to play the mode. Who needs to follow a timetable, anyway? I know that UK-based trains certainly don't.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that you can still play the free web version over on <a href="https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/">Alexander Perrin's official site</a> - it just won't contain the new scheduled mode.</p>
<p>Short Trip looks like a really nice way to decompress and you can find it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187700/Short_Trip/">Steam here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.</p>
<p>The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.</p>

<p>Hayter and Hale aren’t the only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> actors that read for parts across the Legacy Of Kain series. There’s also Colonel Campbell’s Paul Eiding as the Elder God, Liquid Snake’s Cam Clarke as Blood Omen 2’s Marcus, and another Raziel reading by Psycho Mantis’s Doug Stone. They’re all fantastic, of course, although it’s hard to imagine Soul Reaver voiced by anyone else. You can toy with fate, chronology, and destiny, but you don’t <a href="https://youtu.be/4DOKzTHaPfM">mess with perfection</a>.</p><p>Noclip’s entire documentary is very much worth a watch, featuring interviews with the series’ art director Daniel Cabuco, programmer Scott Krotz, and also Ben Starr for some reason. It’s a great reminder how much technical wizardry and clever comprimises went into getting Soul Reaver running on such limited hardware.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered released yesterday, and seems to have had a broadly positive reception. And, just personally speaking, it’s quite special to see the long-dormant series getting some love again. I’m a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ode-to-kain-from-blood-omen-and-his-legacy-including-untitled-goose-game">Blood Omen hipster</a>, of course, but the entire series means a great deal to me. Now remake Blood Omen, you cowards. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
