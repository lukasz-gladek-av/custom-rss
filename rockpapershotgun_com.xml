            <p>Yep, that sound you can hear is the pounding footsteps of a certain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> minutefellow. He's coming to tell you that another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> settlement may soon need your help, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">modder</a>'s figured out how to let folks build stuff using the likes of rocks and beams as they play.</p>
<p>It's not quite got all the bells and whistles of a full settlement building system yet, but its creator is hoping to find someone to collab with on putting together exactly that.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right now, MadAborModding's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4648?tab=description">settlement building proof of concept</a> lets you spawn in world objects, adjust where they're placed on the fly, and then save them in place to make permanent additions to the world. It's a bit rudimentary at current, but there are "over 12,000 spawnable objects" at your fingertips, plus the ability to put 'em wherever you like and have them be there whenever you load up the game.</p>
<p>To build, you start by either using your left and right arrow keys to scroll through the spawnable objects in a random order or save time by adding the exact ones you want to one of the mod's LUA files. From there you look at and use the up arrow on the stone wall, beam or rock you're adding in to pick it up. You'll need to put it down once to enable its collision physics, then pick it up again to place it where you want.</p>
<p>V and B move it up and down, while Z, X, and C rotate it. Once you're done, you press backspace to save your placed stuff, with the mod recording these as ini files it'll then load up next time you start the game. These ini files are also able to be copied out of the game files if you want to share a creation with other people and let them load it into their game.</p>
<p>"I hope someone expands this into an actual settlement system," the modder wrote, "My goal with uploading this is hopefully to bait someone into doing that." They added that they're open to working with other interested parties to make that happen, with categorising objects and making menus being the aspects they'd need the most help pulling off.</p>
<p>What makes his so cool is that Oblivion Remastered still lacks official modding tools, with modders left to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-potential-pinnacle-of-elder-scrolls-modding-reckons-pioneer-modder">push boundaries and experiment</a> with the tools they do have. That often means there's more to install on the player's end to account for the processes at play behind-the-scenes being <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">less straightforward</a>, which makes it impressive that all MadAborModding's creation looks to require is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS for OblivionRemastered</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Six or so years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypixels-riot-backed-hytale-announced">an announcement trailer</a> that made it clear people had an appetite for their game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y building and survival shenanigans (it's got 61 million views to date), Hypixel Studios have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled. On top of that, the studio themselves are gearing up for closure.</p>
<p>Hytale's development kicked off all the way back in 2015, with its devs being the folks behind the huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-biggest-servers">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> publisher Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-have-bought-hytale-developers-hypixel-studios">bought the studio</a> in 2020, not long after we learned that Hytale would have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-have-undead-chickens">undead chickens</a>, and not long before the game's target release year started being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," Hypixel co-founder Noxy wrote in <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">an update post</a> on the studio's website, "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p>
<p>He went on to paint a picture of feature creep lining the road to the game's demise, explaining:</p>
<blockquote>Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game. We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Noxy added that the studio did try to seek out "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward" once Riot had made the call to pull its backing, but this looks to have come to nought. With Hypixel Studios now "winding down", the co-founder thanked the publisher for providing "generous severance and resources" to staff who're being laid off.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Hypixel's Minecraft server will continue to run as normal despite the cancellation and impending closure.</p>
<p>It's a really unfortunate end for Hytale, assuming the game isn't able to be resurrected in some way further down the line, especially given the decade Hypixel put into developing it. "We’re proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next," Noxy wrote to close out his post.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close]]></content:encoded>
