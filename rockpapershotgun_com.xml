            <p>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-chaos">Total Chaos</a> is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a>. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> has my attention.</p>
<p>Total Chaos started life as a popular <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos/images/revolver-coming-to-the-directors-cut">Doom 2 mod</a>, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.</p>

<p>The survival horror comes into play in that you’ll have to scavenge your own makeshift weapons to deal with a selection of horrible things, including big spiders and dudes wearing skull masks - the telltale sign of only the baddest dudes. Maybe that’s their real faces, actually. I’m not up on the deep dude lore just yet. Here are some features, via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Immersive Atmosphere: Explore the nightmarish ruins of Fort Oasis across nine harrowing chapters, each plunging you deeper into its oppressive, decaying world.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Environmental Storytelling: Uncover the island’s darkest secrets and confront your own fractured past through cryptic notes, haunting visuals, and unsettling encounters.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Crafting for Survival: Build and upgrade weapons using scavenged materials to stand a chance against the relentless terrors stalking you.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Face Nightmarish Foes: Engage in desperate battles against horrific creatures, each with their own deadly behaviors and strategies.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Resource Management: Navigate a deep inventory system where every item matters—your survival hinges on careful choices and quick thinking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Steam page also features the word ‘Terrormare’ which, ugh, I won’t hold it against them. Total Chaos is “Coming soon”. I’d say “not soon enough!” but I don’t know how soon they mean, so that’d be like, possibly a lie. I’m not sure. I’m not risking it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are War, Famine, Death and Pestilence. The Drivers of the Apocalypse are Grappling Hooks, Vehicle Swapping, Boss Battles and Upgrades. You'll get to meet all four of the latter in the video game of the same name, a combat racer from Dinosaurs Are Better (citation needed) and their publishers Bonus Stage.

If you're not savvy to scripture, or you don't read comics inspired by scripture, that intro might have confused you. Let me frame it another way: this is a game about the convoy battles from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> movies but with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>'s grappling line and wingsuit combo, which allows you to steal enemy roadsters in the event that yours starts to look a bit bullet-holed and explodey. (Dutiful aside: Just Cause developers Avalanche have, in fact made a Mad Max game, though it's relatively ground-based.) The upgrades appear to include a choice of flying drones: these you may grapple from, in the absence of any large overhanging rock formations.
</p>
<p>
"The game features a series of epic boss encounters, challenging you to make quick decisions and master your driving skills as you take on the toughest road warriors in the wasteland," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3260240/Drivers_of_the_Apocalypse/">the Steam page</a>. This makes it sound like a bossrush format, which I approve of. Mad Max-inspired games should be all crescendo. I don't want to death-race against a bunch of low-level mooks on barbed-wire tricycles. 
</p><p>
There's a plot, unbelievably. "You step into the shoes of Artemis, a junior mercenary working for Thunder Strike Force. Your mission? Stop deadly convoys, defeat powerful bosses, and survive." That's not much of a narrative arc, lads. Give Artemis a surname at least. 
</p>
<p>
Drivers of the Apocalypse is out... at some point. My snarking aside, I think it looks enjoyable. I'm only snarking for the sake of wordcount, really. I hope I can get properly aerial, take shortcuts over mountains and land on cars as they come careening around the bend. Silly wastelanders! That'll teach you to leave the sun roof down.
