            <p>Microsoft have done a U-turn and decided they don't fancy making a series that at least tries to satirise capitalism the face of a price hike. In the US, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will no longer cost $79.99, but the low, low sum of $69.99 instead.</p>
<p>For UK folks, that means a tenner's been knocked off what you'll pay to pre order the standard version of the RPG, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-a-release-date">comes out on October 29th</a>. Xbox and co will be doing the same with their other holiday period games this year, rather than pushing up how much folks are paying to £70/$80.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change">this about face</a> has seen The Outer Worlds 2's pre order price <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">on Steam</a> knocked down from £69.99 to £59.99, the same price as fellow Obsidian role-playing thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. The premium edition'll still cost you £89.99, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">IGN</a> reports folks who've already pre-ordered the game for the higher price will be able to claim refunds from whichever storefront or location they bought it from, and Xbox says these might take a few days to come through.</p> <div>

<p>In their continued efforts to make me feel mildly embarrassed about having liked the first Outer Worlds and being at least curious to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-11-thoroughly-whelming-minutes-of-the-outer-worlds-2">give the sequel a go</a>, Microsoft announced this price change with not one but two meme posts to the series' official Musk platform account.</p>
<p>"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," read the first one. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a> to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2. While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can."</p>
<p>Ok, bit cringe maybe, but I can deal with it and...oh no. They almost immediately posted a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948025734888599847">second highly-edited corporate meme clip</a> of someone punching a Spacers' Choice moon mascot with the price plastered over its face. Look, I get that the devs probably weren't fans of the price increase either, given it might well have meant fewer folks buying their game, but maybe don't try to play this off as some grand victory. It's some execs going 'harrummph' and putting their tails between their legs for now.</p>
<p>Some execs, I have to point out, who oversaw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rat-king-has-eaten-my-lunch-and-now-its-going-to-eat-yours">Rat King</a> is dead, long live the Fool King. In this medieval roguelite autobattler, you must murder a skeleton monarch with dice. You will do this not by loading bags of D20s into a culverin and shooting the Fool King point blank, though yes, that sounds like an amazing lategame unlock. Instead, you will be rolling the dice to determine how many knights, peasants, wizards and crossbowmen you can summon to each battlefield. I've been playing the prototype, and while roguelites are thick as wheat these days, this is a promising contender. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Let me walk you through it. First, you pick three dice corresponding to unit type. Then, you roll them to decide how many of each unit you can conjure. You get to re-roll selected dice exactly once before committing. Then, you line them all up facing the enemy army using drop-and-drag controls. Then, you bellow CHARGE at your computer (while pressing the "fight" button) and look on indolently as they sword, fireball and arrow each other to bits. This was exactly how Richard the Lionheart did it during the siege of Castillon-sur-Agen, except he had to imagine the fireballs.
</p>
<p>
Whether you win or lose, you'll earn coin from the engagement with which to customise your units. Maybe a passive for your knights that electrifies attackers? Maybe some poison for your crossbows? You can also add pips to your die faces, and buy new dice to increase the number of formations in play. The basic roguelite tuggowar here is whether to enhance the units you have, or increase your army's headcount so that you aren't outflanked and surrounded.
</p>
<p>
The autobattling bits seem rudimentary by the standards of, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>, but it's early days for the Fool King, with no release date in sight. Possibly the neatest feature is the asynchronous multiplayer. As developers Loot Donkey explain on <a href="https://lootdonkey.itch.io/fool-king">the Itch.io page</a> (where you'll find the downloadable prototype), "your ghost data and choices are recorded so that you will be facing real player decisions and may even have to battle your past self in a future run." My past self? I farking hate that guy. Fetch me my culverin and don't spare the D20s.

            <p>Developer Julian LeFay, a key cog in the early days of Bethesda and the development of classic Elder Scrolls RPGs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena">Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, has died. His passing was announced by OnceLost Games, the studio he co-founded in 2019, and follows a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>LeFay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens">stepped away from his most recent development post</a> as technical director at OnceLost, where he'd been working on Daggerfall-inspired RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> alongside fellow Bethesda veteran Ted Peterson, last week. OnceLost revealed at the time that this was due to his cancer worsening, writing that LeFay's doctors had informed them "his time with us is limited".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement on LeFay's passing aged 59, the studio's team wrote that the Danish-born developer "was not just a colleague - he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today" and praised his "unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve".</p>
<p>"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms," they added, "Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all."</p> <div>

<p>LeFay joined Bethesda as a programmer in 1987, and was a key influence on many other RPGs through his work on Elder Scrolls. He was programming lead on Arena and Battlespire, project leader on 1996's legendary Daggerfall, and is credited on The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>. According to Peterson, his name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YhxCkF09Y">was also an inspiration</a> for Tamriel's god of wisdom and logic, Julianos.</p>
<p>LeFay also served as director and chief programmer on Bethesda's The Terminator and follow-up The Terminator 2029 back in those early days. He largely disappeared from the spotlight after leaving Bethesda, working on various projects including some with Sega, before being dragged back in via an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLGi5RK8V8">interview with YouTuber Ian Phoenix in 2017</a>, which snowballed into LeFay and Peterson deciding to team back up on an RPG that'd be a worthy successor to the likes of Daggerfall.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>It’s with great sadness we learn of the passing of Julian LeFay. </p><p>He was the driving force in the creation of The Elder Scrolls and the foundations of Bethesda as a game studio. </p><p>Simply put, without Julian, we would not be here today. If you had the opportunity to work with… <a href="https://t.co/55bJAaL7qz">pic.twitter.com/55bJAaL7qz</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1948047731429159330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That led to OnceLost's founding in 2019 and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">Kickstarter for The Wayward Realms</a>. As Peterson and the studio's staff wrote when they revealed LeFay had stepped away from work on the game, their plan is to keep on developing their RPG in a fashion that matches his vision for it.</p>
<p>Thanks to LeFay for all of his contributions to the medium and all the best to those he leaves behind.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died]]></content:encoded>
