Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">no longer exists even as a brand name</a>, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he <em>is</em> the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes in the form of a single tweet, following a grieving Monolith fan's request to "make the Condemned 1 &amp; 2 Remake &amp; quite f**king around". Hall <a href="https://x.com/JaceHall/status/1896149517063663708">responded</a>: "I will see what may be possible. Absolutely no promises. Please have ZERO expectations. This will take me some time."
</p>
<p>
Hall left Monolith in 2003 - two years before Criminal Origins launched on Xbox 360 - to work in an executive role at Warner. While at Warner, he co-led plans for a Condemned connected universe, spilling into the realm of film, but these ambitions never quite came to fruition. Hall departed Warner in 2008 to work at a string of outfits broadly concerned with game-as-service business models, entertainment production and esports. 
</p>
<p>
Even as he has moved between roles, however, Hall hasn't forgotten about Condemned. Back in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726144727/https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303">wrote on Facebook</a> that "I am consistently asked when a third game might be created" and that he is "contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/condemned-3-would-be-made-without-interference-or-limitations">Ian Games</a> subsequently, Hall reiterated that: "I am going to grant a license to use the Condemned franchise in general, and the chosen developer will be able to pick what kind of game they want to make. They can choose their vision of the content. They can build up momentum. Perhaps a prequel. Perhaps a simple mobile phone app for starters. It's all on the table. I'm open to hearing new ideas."
</p>
<p>
Would you like Condemned to return? I think Criminal Origins is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">a well-crafted horror game</a> with excellently vicious and antsy melee combat, but "well-crafted", here, risks being a justification for the fantasy of playing a cop who beats up homeless people and addicts with a pipe. That the cop's victims have been mutated and driven berserk by a sci-fantasy McGuffin doesn't really counter the argument that the game actively channels hatred towards the less fortunate, though Monolith are hardly the only horror game developers to do this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which game developer I'd trust to bring Condemned back. I guess the quickfix corrective optics would be to turn the tables and have you fight a bunch of deranged and screaming police.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 has a new Sid Meier's game update that makes changes to Sid Meier's user interface, leader AI, Age mechanics, Mementos and naval unit handling. Developers Firaxis have also stirred in a free bonus Natural Wonder, Sid Meier's Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the on-going arguments about whether (Sid Meier's - OK, enough of that now) Civilization 7 is an unambiguous low point for the series, or yet another flawed 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim that will find its feet via post-launch updates, I love the idea of a Bermuda Triangle just popping up in my simulation, like a black hole spawning in my fridge. I hope it works as in legends about the real-life Bermuda Triangle (or in the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>), with whole armies and fleets getting swallowed up in transit and/or scattered across the globe at random.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Formally titled Update 1.1.0, the patch is reportedly based on “community suggestions and feedback”. It’s live today and – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">as rumoured last week</a> - accompanies the first part of the paid Crossroads Of The World DLC Collection, which features a new leader, Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (in the Modern Age) and Carthage (in Antiquity), and a Natural Wonder pack with four more Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.
</p>
<p>
The developers had planned to launch Civilization 7’s first in-game Event, Natural Wonder Battle, alongside the update, but “events are now being postponed to a later update to allow us more time to prioritize quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide”. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a PR-supplied highlights reel for Update 1.1.0. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players)
</p>
<p>
- Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues
</p>
<p>
- Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!)
</p>
<p>
- Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion
</p>
<p>
- Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers
</p>
<p>
- Balance pass on several Mementos
</p>
<p>
- Refinements to the Army Unpacking action
</p>
<p>
- Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account
</p>
<p>
- For console players: all prior updates from Update 1.0.1 Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be implemented, in addition to the items noted above
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s another Civ 7 patcheroo on the way on 25th March, called Update 1.1.1. It introduces Mount Everest as a free Natural Wonder, adds quick move functionality, and tinkers further with the AI, amongst other things. It's timed to accompany the second half of the aforesaid Crossroads Of The World DLC, which adds another new leader, Simón Bolívar, together with Nepal (Modern Age) and Bulgaria (Exploration Age). Here’s a breakdown in advance:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes. Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. 
</p>
<p>
- Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI
</p>
<p>
- Adding Quick Move functionality
</p>
<p>
- Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities
</p>
<p>
- Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games
</p>
<p>
- Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in Civ VI
</p>
<p>
- Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible
</p>
<p>
- New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In our fashionably late <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civilization 7 review</a>, Actual Game Designer Greg Costikyan concluded that “despite its flaws, Civilization 7 sustains that “one more turn!” desire to plow through history and see what happens next.” I am certainly interested to see what happens next with Civ 7. Going by site stats, you are all very intrigued by it, despite some cogent and withering assessments of its failings.
