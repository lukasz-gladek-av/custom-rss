            <p>With season two of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-radiates-new-vegas-with-a-trailer-heavy-on-stupid-sexy-house-and-a-december-debut-date">Fallout TV Show</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">going all-in on Goggins</a>, December's not short of Fallout things. Yet, on the day that sees <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ditch-any-fallout-4-mods-which-mess-with-the-main-menu-ahead-of-its-anniversary-edition-update-bethesda-warn">re-released in proabable mod-messing up fashion</a>, I'm sitting here looking at a different Fallout thing and thinkling it might be the one of the four I'm most interested in checking out. It's a beefy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> expansion mod called Fallout: Long 15 and it's set to release on December 12th.</p>

<p>As you might have gleaned from that new reveal trailer, the mod's a map expansion which takes the Lonesome Road location of the Long 15 highway - the trader-heavy road leading from Nevada back to NCR-held California - and builds it into a full expansion. It boasts over 30 fresh quests and a whole heap of new characters whom you can chat to or show your big iron. Wait, not in that way.</p>
<p>Aside from that trailer and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsFXdAs4jbE&amp;t=5s">hour-long showcase</a> from September, the latter of which contains some minor spoilers, the mod's got my attention because it's a bigger sequel of sorts to another mod from creator ToxicWhiteout and their team that's spent a little while top of the 'add to load order' I keep for whenever I inevitably find time for another New Vegas playthrough. That first one, dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180?tab=description">Dry Wells - Legion Expansion</a>, is designed to offer about six hours of fun. Long 15, meanwhile, is aiming to offer 20 across a map ten times as big.</p><p>Sheer size obviously isn't the be-all-and-end-all, but the mod looks like it has plenty to fill that space. Towns like Baker and Kelso are in line for a visit, while a villa called Casa Stanton run by a guy everyone calls Frick has intrigued me as I've flicked through the showcase trying to get a good sense of the thing, but not have it all spoiled for me.</p>
<p>Plenty of choice and consequence is promised by this trip to California, which sounds like it's designed to be done mid-playthrough, before you're then offered the option to nuke either or both of the Long 15 and Dry Wells at the conclusion of the Lonesome Road DLC. Getting started with Long 15 also looks like it'll fit nicely into your usual New Vegas journey, with the gate at the back of Mojave Outpost being the way in after you've talked to a new character hanging out near that hard-to-miss giant statue of two rangers shaking hands.</p>
<p>Long 15'll be available via Nexus Mods once it releases. Judging by Dry Wells, all you'll need to run it is a copy of the game with all of its DLC, plus maybe a couple of performance-related mods to help it run extra smoothly.</p>

            <p>Sit down. "I’m preaching patience." Stay calm. "I don’t want fans to feel anxious." There's no need to hide underneath a chest of drawers. Some of those are things I've had to tell my firework-averse cat around Bonfire Night time here in the UK. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in a fresh interview that's also about Bethesda's imminently to be released again radioactive golden goose, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off", according to the Bethesda bossman, speaking to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ</a> from an office that has shelves (ooh, fancy). "I like to just announce stuff and release it," he added. "My perfect version – and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear."</p>
<p>I mean, technically it would be reappearing, given we all famously saw some its hills, ruins, and shrubbery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced">back in 2018</a>. Well, assuming that E3 trailer actually showed a landscape that resembles anything like one that we'll be exploring all these years on. I personally can't wait to try and climb the exact rock you can see in the foreground on the right, at the 14 second or so mark. Sure, it's not one of the big mountains, but you've gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to cleanliness is next to Toddliness. He was also asked in light of his comment about the game just appearing whether Bethesda could shadow drop The Elder Scrolls 6, as they did with Oblivion Remastered. "You might say that was a test run. It worked out well," was his answer. If Oblivion Remastered's anything to go by, in that case we can look forward to at least six months or so of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">leak and report-inspired chatter</a> in the run-up, to make sure this game Bethesda confirmed they were making about seven years ago really catches everyone off guard.</p><p>In news I'll adopt a less snarky tone for, Howard also spoke a bit about meeting the folks from series wiki the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages when they popped by to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-6-memorial-character-moulded-by-tamriels-finest-internet-lorekeepers-is-now-set-in-stone">design a character for the game</a> as a memorial to a forum user whose mid-2000s roleplay campaigns have some interesting connections to proper Elder Scrolls lore.</p>
<p>The dev was also asked whether he'd drink toilet water to survive during a real nuclear apocalypse, which was the point at which he drew the line on a series of hypotheticals based around that scenario. He thinks he'd "do ok" if the world ended, which is all the proof I need that he's probably never watched the 1984 film Threads. Or, at the very least, he's somehow managed to forget about it. We'd all be fucked, fella.</p>
<p>Maybe he's got a plan to install his head on an immortal mech body or something, and he'll come hunt me down for chatting shit once the bombs drop. Now that would be a shadow drop with the element of surprise unquestionably on its side.</p>
