            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism scandal</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a> earlier this year, Bungie's corporate overlords Sony have reiterated again that extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is still aiming to release by March next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles have seen the parent corp flatly admit that game's not doing as well as Sony imagined when they bought Bungie.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20251111/SzQTgsRB/202603_2q_02_en/index.html">earnings call</a> as part of the company's latest financial results, Sony CFO Lin Tao responded to a question about Marathon by declaring that they are "fully dedicated to launching the title as scheduled". That schedule being by the end of this financial year, which concludes at the end of March 2026. Tao's words aren't that surprising, given they've been the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off">company line</a> throughout this year.
</p>
<p>However, back in August, Tao did mention that Bungie hoped to be able to stick a fresh release date on the game at some point this autumn. We're by no means out of that window yet and things could change any day now, but as of writing no new date's been forthcoming and winter beckons. To be fair, Tao revealed that Bungie are still "in the process of analysing Marathon's performance in terms of gameplay and retention during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">October's technical test</a>, with tweaks to be made "as needed".</p>
<p>Things being pretty quiet on the Marathon front <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">isn't unusual at this point</a>, but questions'll only intensify if it keeps inching closer to March without that new date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these financial results revealed that Sony's accountants have had to record an impairment charge which indicates that Bungie's current value is about 31.5 billion yen (about £155 million/$204 million) less than the number the corp would like it to be. That underperformance relative to what was envisioned by Sony when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio</a> is being dumped firmly at Destiny 2's door, with Tao saying that "partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had". As a result, profits have been cut into and corporate frowny faces abound, though Tao did declare that the companies "will continue to make improvements". Hopefully that doesn't just mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's also hoping Marathon can avoid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">Concord-esque fate</a> whenever it fully breaks cover.</p>

            <p>A beefy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> update has just dropped, and it aims to take care of a couple of bugs and exploits which have become infamous bugbears over the last little while. No longer will people be able to fly up to rooftops by smacking drones with sledgehammers, and no longer will lock-guided missiles cheekily ignore countermeasures.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This and more can be found if you leaf through the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-update-1-1-1-5">update 1.1.1.5</a>, which has rolled out this morning on the fine day of November 11th. Those lead with the fix for the drone exploit, which was seeing folks hop atop the unmanned aircraft and whack them with hammers so they flew into the air, acting as lifts to rooftops from which you could then snipe with impunity. Personally, I'm sad such a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzT9L4llKzk&amp;t=1s">fun fairground ride</a>'s been outlawed, but I also die every 12 seconds in each match to someone playing properly, so hadn't really noticed the exploiters.</p>
<p>The lock-guided missile fix is one we've known was coming since last week, when EA opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-devs-temporarily-confiscate-the-infantry-fighting-vehicles-bugged-lock-on-missiles">temporarily disable them</a> until this patch rolled out. Beyond those, vehicles should now spawn as intended during breakthrough and conquest matches, and "multiple battle royale issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and end of round transitions" have been dealt with. Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-redsec-best-guns">REDSEC</a> fixes include instances of kills following respawns leading squads to be instantly eliminated and matches deciding not to end after the last team are wiped out.</p>
<p>In terms of player-specific stuff, the update's seen EA make it easier not to have your aim knocked too far off course when landing or sliding and reduce bullet "dispersion" being too high because it hasn't adjusted properly to you moving more slowly than the speed of sound. Good news for people who like tearing through the middle of battles like a toddler having an almighty sugar rush. Some progression blocks on challenges have also been lifted.</p><p>If you've participated in any of the drone hammering, remember to apologise to the next one you see for all of the trouble. We'll have to wait and see what ends up being the next glitch dubbed the scourge of the battling fields now this boogeyman's been snuffed out.</p>
