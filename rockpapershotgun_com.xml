            <p>
This is probably a sentence that could be said literally any day of the week, but a new cosy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> sim is on the block, this time taking the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starsand-island">Starsand Island</a>. The flavour on this occasion is of the anime variety, with some slightly goofier farming mechanics (i.e. turning your watermelon patch into one singular, 10 foot tall watermelon), some very Pokemon Legends: Arceus looking combat, and some appropriately cute animals to hang out with. And there's skateboarding! But never do launches go all that smoothly, as developer Seed Sparkle Lab have had to do a dash of damage control regarding some concerns over the game.
</p>
<p>
A pair of update posts were shared today, the second of which we'll start with. For one, it appears a bunch of potential early adopters of the early access release have been concerned with in-game purchases, but according to said <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319774?l=english">update post</a>, there are none! "Please enjoy the game with confidence," so say the devs.
</p>
<p>
The second concern that was addressed was regarding some potentially dodgy lines in the game's user agreement, partially in relation to those supposed in-game purchases, but also partially to do with things like mods being restricted. According to the devs however, "All unreasonable or overly restrictive clauses in the user agreement have been removed. We will never restrict players from using mods or other custom content, and there is no anti-cheat system implemented in the game. After the full release, Steam Workshop will also be opened to allow everyone to freely create and share their ideas."
</p>
<p>
There has also been some feedback over a lack of story bits and voice acting, which has been duly noted as well, including some optimisation issues, though there are plans for improvements on all counts. "Starsand Island is not perfect, and we will continue to listen carefully to the voices from our players while constantly improving and refining the game," the post explains.
</p><p>
Regarding that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772?l=english">first update post</a>, however, is a strange situation where a bunch of positive reviews have popped up that appear to be AI-generated. Seed Sparkle Lab say they don't understand why this is happening either, asking whoever is behind this to stop. Better than review bombing I suppose? But maybe cut it out anyway, just a weird thing to do.
</p>
<p>
If you have any interest in picking up Starsand Island, you can do so on Steam, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">here</a>.

            <p>The fine frigate which serves as the featured image for this article is called the Stately Gunwale. That's not a name I, the boat's creator, gave it. It's a name ShipShaper's demo automatically assigned my vessel when I picked the set of colours I wished it to be painted. Quite frankly, I doubt I could have dreamed up a more fitting moniker for my deliberate attempt to fling something funky onto the high seas.</p>

<p>ShipShaper's the latest creation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-falconeer-review">The Falconeer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulwark-falconeer-chronicles-review">Bulwark</a> developer Tomas Sala, who describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve always loved ships and boats, perhaps it's the idea of going off to explore or an enduring fascination with the ocean. But I love ships. Over the last years I've known that ships would be at the centre of any Falconeer/Bulwark follow up, and what started out as a little folly made for Bulwark has grown into its own thing. ShipShaper is a small, explorative shipbuilder I made for the simple pleasure of shaping boats and ships. You pull, push, and drag forms into place, creating everything from humble fishing vessels to tall ships, ironclads, and early dreadnoughts. There’s no grid, no ‘meta’, and no right answer. Just shapes, balance, and the slow satisfaction of something coming together.</blockquote>
<p>Starting off with a small, bare template, you stretch and bend you boat into whatever shape you like. I stuck a big hump in the middle of the deck, because that's practical, then peppered masts, exhausts, and gun turrets about with reckless abandon. The engine cover is wedged halfway through the hull, and the sides are stocked with protruding galley oars which don't touch the water and cannons pointed at impractical angles. An anchor and some flaps round out a ship that should fare well at sea, when its prow isn't jutting underwater.</p><p>Once you've built the thing, you can snap some screenshots of it in a waterborne diorama. Sala has teased that "the full game will come with an open creative license to use the ships you create in any way you want for your own game development, boardgame or modding venture". You'll also be able 3D print your ship or import into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a>.</p>
<p>It's well worth spending at least five minutes playing around with ShipShaper, which doesn't have a release date as of writing. You can find its demo and wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4339280/ShipShaper/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
