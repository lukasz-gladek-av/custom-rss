            <p>Remember when you were young, and had your first crush? All of a sudden your hormones are going nuts, and here's this person you can't think about without your face contorting into a goofy smile, or talk about without bashfully giggling. Well, it seems that's how part-time Gearbox exec and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">full-time social media poster</a> Randall Steward Pitchford II feels about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s freshly revealed first DLC Vault Hunter.</p>
<p>It's understandable to be fair. Which of us hasn't found ourselves gazing longingly at a former casino robot dressed like a goth version of John Wayne, before volunteering to help animate its card-throwing? Sometimes, C4SH rules not just everything around you, but your very heart.</p>

<p>C4SH is the name of this cowbot, whom you'll be able to play as if you splash out for him when he arrives alongside the game's first story DLC early next year. The Vault Hunter's "a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts, with his bio continuing that the first story DLC, Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, "is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favour."</p><p>As you might have guessed, C4SH is aimed at folks who like playing in a way that comes with high risk for potentially high reward, with the buckarndroid's skills being deliberately unpredictable. That's all cool, but the more important thing emphasised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE">C4SH's reveal at the Tokyo Game Show</a> is this: Randy Pitchford fucking LOVES him.</p>
<p>"C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common," the exec said during this on-stage reveal, having previously descibed the cowboy robot as "very dear to me, very personal to me." What's engendered these strong feelings in such a famously chill and dispassionate fellow? Well, Pitchford has both won and lost while doing some real life gambling, the CEO said, and he's also a professional magician. "I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game," said the smitten Gearbox skipper.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll have more to share in the coming months about C4SH and Story Pack 1, but for now, check out what's up next in our post-launch roadmap, including our first Seasonal Mini-Event, Bounty Pack, and Invincible Boss. <a href="https://t.co/FUYq5qduqO">pic.twitter.com/FUYq5qduqO</a></p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1972142127967850710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So, if you've ever wondered what it's like to basically be Randy Pitchford - or at least a cyborg Clint Eastwood that he sees a lot of himself in - now's your chance to find out. I assume there's a posting interface built into the HUD when you load in as C4SH. Either that, or you'll have to run two monitors for the authentic experience of arguing with tweeters about the capabilities of their game-playing boxes as you play Borderlands. Remember: when it feels like you should probably stop posting, do not stop posting.</p>
<p>As they've revealed C4SH, Gearbox have also put out a DLC roadmap for Borderlands 4. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, the first story pack C4SH arrives as part of early next year, also includes extra main and side missions in a new zone of Kairos and new gear. Hopefully the majority of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">performance issues</a> which've plagued the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since release will be sorted by then, so you can enjoy C4SH rather than crash.</p>
