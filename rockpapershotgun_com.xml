            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> season 28 launches on February 10th, and appears to add competitive glazing to the now 7-year-old battle royale. The game's "newest tactical mechanic", so says the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-game-updates">announcement post</a>, is Hardlight Mesh, a glowy, bullet-resistant window that teams can either throw up to defend a hidey hole or, with enough lead, rockets, and/or angry kicks, break down to form a new ingress point. Holes in walls? That’s old hat. ApeLegs is <em>disrupting</em> holes in walls. There’ll probably be a TechCrunch article on it.</p>

<p>Here’s a little teaser trailer, which opens with a tribute to Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-co-creator-infinity-ward-and-respawn-entertainment-co-founder-and-battlefield-head-vince-zampella-dies-aged-55">died last December</a> in a high-speed car collision along with his passenger. Said tribute is then immediately followed by someone hurtling through a window. O...okay.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AccidentalP">Accidently Partridgian</a> video edit aside, we can see that Hardlight Mesh panels do actually play a lightly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>-y - or dare I say it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">Highguard</a>-y - role in dynamic point defence. Though I’m always unnerved by attempts to make Apex gunfights more locked-down and static; all its best action tends to be more scrappy, dynamic, and three-dimensional, with lots of panicked scrambling up walls and near-constant bumslides. That said, these panels are also the source of an agurably needed buff to the oft-overlooked Controller Legends class – yer Wattsons and yer Catalysts – who, alone, gain the ability to repair and reinforce these fresh new takes on glass sheets. Next-gen windows, they is.</p><p>It also sounds like they can be countered by certain Legend abilities, including those of Fuse, who’s getting a rework in S28. His ultimate, instead of drawing a ring of fire, will instead pepper the target area with cluster bombs – and judging by the trailer, the initial projectile can lodge inside shields and dump its payload onto the opposite side, nullifying Hardlight’s defensive advantage.</p>
<p>That’s fine, if a bit similar to the tactical ability of rival Legdge (and lore buddy) Mad Maggie, which does basically the same thing but worse. More worrying are the promised Bloodhound buffs, detailed to us in a separate email from EA: they’re getting an "improved Tactical Scan and massive reduced Ultimate cooldown", as well as the power to extent their ult's duration by knocking enemies while it’s active. More legal wallhacks, then. Cool. COOL. What’s even the point of having Windows 2 to cower behind when a rampaging plague doctor can x-ray-vision you from six thousand miles away?</p>
<p>Respawn may or may not answer that question on February 6th, when a more in-depth Designer’s Note blog on the season update goes live. That’s ahead of the full patch notes on the 9th, and the update's release on the 10th.</p>

            <p>Friends, I think I have unearthed the next Hidden Gem, though Hidden Arrow Trap might be the more appropriate framing. It’s a 2D precision platformer called the The Pale Piper that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>. It’s the work of FreeTimeDev, who is also known for Godot tools and synthwave jams on <a href="https://freetimedev.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925120/The_Pale_Piper/">out today on Steam</a>, and the demo has killed me eleventy million times. </p><!--more-->
<p>The Pale Piper is a sequel of sorts to the German folktale (folktail?) about the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Pied Piper of Hamelin was a musical exterminator who used his magic ditties to lure away all the rats infesting a village. When the villagers wouldn’t pay him, he unleashed his Satanic melodies to lead all the local children away too. The moral of the story is: kill bards on sight, especially when they’re dual classing. It turns out the Pied Paper story may have been inspired by a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/travel/article/20200902-the-grim-truth-behind-the-pied-piper">real historical incident</a>. </p>

<p>The Pale Piper invites you to “silence the cursed melody” of a post-Pied world. Typically, when videogames try to build on folk legends it results in stories of the “What if Goldilocks mastered the blade and overthrew Porridge Inc” variety. FreeTimeDev’s approach seems relatively elegant so far. You are some kind of resurrected wraith with glowing blue eyes and an extendable jump. You are exploring a metroidvania labyrinth of crushing blocks and spike pits and things with glowing red eyes that kill you instantly.</p><p>“Looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>!” screech we pitiful headline writers, like chicks after worms, but alas, not quite, because the Pale Piper is unarmed. Your only defence against the labyrinth’s many terrors is a combination of excellent pattern reading, even excellenter timing, and the capacity to die repeatedly and respawn at the area entrance without pulling your own ears off in consternation.</p>
<p>You can gather coins in each area, if you want to make life even harder for yourself. There are some traversal abilities to unlock, as well. From the trailer, it looks like they’ve got post-Dreamcast Sonic’s homing attack in there, and a local variation on Metroid’s morph ball.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I have the fortitude to keep plugging with The Pale Piper, but the softly crumbling industrial fantasy setting definitely grabs my gizzards, and I like the needling menace of the writing. Early on in the game you free a man from a cage and are asked to track down and slay the Rat King. He remarks that silence is "the only law that still obeys him". I will bet you several of those optional collectible coins that the caged man is the Pied Piper, and that the protagonist is actually one of the abducted kids, and that the Rat King is actually one of the good guys.</p>
