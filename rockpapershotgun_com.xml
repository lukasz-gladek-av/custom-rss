            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has been revealed, all official-like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">after months of leaks</a>. And what a reveal it was, with a trailer featuring enough explosions to satisfy Michael Bay for at least two hours - though without a release date to accompany it.</p>
<p>Yep, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-release-date-appears-to-have-leaked-jumping-the-gun-ahead-of-its-reveal-trailer">October date recently cited by a prominent leaker</a> is on target, as for now all we got was a tease of the campaign that ended in promo for a multiplayer reveal next week. Which, to be fair, is a chef's kiss way to have done things if EA's aim was to be totally on brand for today's big shooters.</p>

<p>Despite the game's teaser trailer making a big deal of NATO being under attack, and featured various European cities, this trailer looked to be tapping more into the typical American jingoism both this series and its brother in big shootering Call of Duty have embraced at various points over the years. While the latter's now got Beavis and Butthead in it, this reveal was very much flying the flag for Battlefield 6 being back in its grimy, realistic modern-day military guise, at least as far as the singleplayer's concerned.</p>
<p>The game also really seems to hate helicopters, with the two-minute trailer featuring no less than four rotored birds having a bad time in various crashy and explodey ways, as things cut between cinematic action and a US president talking about an attack by the Pax Armata private military corporation. They're shaping up to be Battlefield 6's main baddies, further hinting in my eyes that it might be a bit of a 'Can you believe these mercenaries do war for money? You should do it for honour and nationalism like we do' sort of tale.</p>
<p>The trailer ended with the announcement that the game's multiplayer bit will be getting its own reveal on July 31st. That'll kick off at 7:30 PM BST / 2:30 PM ET / 11:30 AM PT / 8:30 PM CEST, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BRbvYxgOY">link's already live</a> if you want to sit in chat for the whole week gradually typing out the lyrics to every anti-war song ever written.</p>
<p>EA promise it'll showcase some maps, as well as new and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">returning modes</a> you'll be able to battle your way through the fields of. That's the same EA, of course, who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">reportedly hoping 100 million people</a> will join you in those killing fields. Given how the trailer went, I assume that means they'll have 100 million spare helicopters on standby.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date]]></content:encoded>
