I think it might be time to stop letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> head Randy Pitchford tweet about his own games. Just last month, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">accidentally shared</a> the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> was getting an earlier than expected release date ahead of an official announcement; he put that one down to time zones. This time his overly eager attitude towards posting hasn't revealed any information about Borderlands 4 he wasn't meant to, but it is something that could maybe, just potentially, be viewed as ever-so-slightly out of touch.

<p>
Last week, when another Twitter user expressed concern over the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> potentially being $80 (a price point hasn't been set just yet), Pitchford first noted that this is not his call. To be fair to him, I imagine this'll come down to other people at Gearbox as well as Borderlands' publisher 2K. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Then, Pitchford thought he'd follow it up with this little nugget: "If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Now, here's the thing. For a huge portion of people, even $60 is unthinkable for a game purchase, let alone $80. Second of all, have you seen the economy recently Randy! It's not great! The Borderlands series is more than 15 years old, a lot of your audience will be regular people with jobs struggling to make ends meet. Not exactly sure you thought through this one all that much, buddy.
</p>
<p>
Again, no idea if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not, at a recent PAX East panel (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-gamers-express-concern-about-borderlands-4-potentially-costing-80-gearbox-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">IGN</a>) Pitchford even said he doesn't know how much it'll be. I just think we could perhaps take a little more tact, especially seeing as we don't know whether $80 games will work or not yet.
