            <p>It's happened. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">modding</a> is one step closer to 100% completion.</p>
<p>The 2025 game about a 2006 game that's undergone some serious plastic surgery has gotten its first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">mod</a> that adds in Star Wars' iconic fighty sticks, so you can pretend to be Suke Lkywalker, Yo Da, or the other ones.</p>

<p>The modder who's stepped up the plate and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4702?tab=description">added lightsabers</a> to Oblivin' on a prayer Remastered is CosmicBoogaloo. They've delivered five different colours of light-up sword, all with authentic 'vzzzzhhhh' and 'vwwwummm' sound effects.</p>
<p>There's red, green, blue, purple, and yellow. All I'll say is, if you join the Dark Brotherhood and use a red one, even Lucien Lachance might think you're a bit too edgy. You'll have to console command them into your inventory once you've downloaded the mod, which requires <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331">Runtime EditorIDs (Console)</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>. Think of it as just another force power that involves typing midichlorian-infused item IDs into your brain code.</p>

<p>CosmicBoogaloo's a modder whose stuff I've seen pretty regularly in my regular trips to Oblivion Remastered's Nexus Mods page. They've also recently added <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681">a gun</a> into the game, in case you'd prefer to roleplay as John McClane while you save Cyrodiil. I'll be honest, their mods which add <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4232">a literal tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4076">a brick</a> to OR as melee weapons are probably more up my alley.</p>
<p>I also feel like I have to mention that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3453?tab=description">one of their mods</a> saw them attempt to make the heads of every Oblivion Remastered character type invisible, and they apparently accidentally ended up rendering "pretty much EVERY normal NPC" in Cyrodiil headless. Happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's to take nothing away from their lightsaber achievement. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42462?tab=description">Every</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/26200">Elder</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92440">Scrolls</a> game needs a bunch of lightsaber mods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-inevitable-lightsaber-mod-made-by-someone-who-once-accidentally-decapitated-the-entire-population-of-cyrodiil]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Well, that was quick. Following rumours last week and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure">our own report just today</a>, 11 Bit Studios have confirmed that they made use of generative AI tools in sci-fi management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> for the translation and localisation of what they say is a very small amount of text. They've also revealed that they used AI-generated assets as placeholders during development, but "in a very limited manner".</p>
<p>11 Bit argue that all of this represents "a limited impact on your gaming experience", but concede that they should have fessed up about it regardless. For context, the game launched on PC with no mention of any AI-generated material, including on Steam, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">Valve requires developers to disclose such things</a>.
</p>

<p>
All this comes in the form of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i?ref_src=embed">a Bluesky post</a>. "AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner," it reads. "Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.
</p>
<p>
"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder," the post continues. "This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game."
</p>
<p>
You can find a screenshot of the asset in question below. 11 Bit say they have carried out a review of the game and "confirmed that this was an isolated case". The asset is now being updated.
</p>

<p>
The developers also confirm that The Alters has made use of AI translation or localisation. The game features parody licensed movies you can watch with your clones to boost their morale. These were externally produced, 11 Bit say, and required "last-minute" translations.</p>
<p>"Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch", the post goes on, while insisting that 11 Bit had always intended to have the relevant materials properly translated by agencies in the course of a localisation hotfix after release. The hotfix in question is now in development.
</p>
<p>
The developers conclude by noting that the external movies are "approx. 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text". The alternative to using genAI to create them, 11 Bit argue, was to release the dialogue exclusively in English. They didn't want to do this, but now "acknowledge this was the wrong call" and that "no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know". 
</p>
<p>I think the defence that the vast majority of The Alters was made the Old-Fashioned Way by tangible beings of flesh is fair enough. That said, I feel inclined to pass on <a href="https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle">Dordle</a> developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zaratustra.bsky.social/post/3lstkkc62ns26">Zaratustra</a>'s response to 11 Bit's statement: "If you feel 0.3% of the game's text is not a big deal to have generated with AI, which percentage would you draw the line at[?]"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom have a tough fight on their hands at the moment. No, Arkveld hasn't escaped from its lair to terrorise the non-OP masses. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been suffering from some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">pretty nasty performance issues</a> on PC.</p>
<p>While they don't look to have the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> running as well as some kind of crash and stuffer-free Usain Bolt quite yet, the release of Wilds' second title update has seen the studio try to curb some shader compilation and VRAM-related problems.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside deploying the update, which brings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-second-title-update-is-adding-in-lagiacrus-from-monster-hunter-3-when-it-arrives-next-week">Lagiacrus and a bunch of other new stuff</a> to the game (including Fender guitars, because why not), Capcom have put out a fix aimed at stopping shader compilation while you're playing from causing "high CPU load and unstable performance".</p>
<p>Now, instead of shaders being complied once you're hunning the mons, that process'll take place at launch when there's a fresh update to apply, and you won't need to worry about trying to delete your shader cache files in order to improve the situation.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Steam hunters!</p><p>With Title Update 2's arrival, we have resolved a previous issue where shader compilation during gameplay caused high CPU load and unstable performance. </p><p>Please be aware of the following when booting up the game after installing the latest update:</p><p>⚪ Shader… <a href="https://t.co/PzXQK3NGvV">pic.twitter.com/PzXQK3NGvV</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1939617276677759340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>That's not the only thing the devs have done, with title update two's <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html">full patch notes</a> revealing some other Steam-specific tweaks designed to help reverse the game's recent review fortunes in the Valve money place.</p>
<p>First of all, you'll now have a warning pop up if you try to launch the Wilds with out of date GPU drivers, an unsupported OS, or while using compatibility mode. There's also some extra support for Nvidia and AMD upscaling and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>The big fixes in the notes, though, concern VRAM. Capcom have tweaked how much of it's used when the game's streaming textures, fixed the VRAM usage estimate in the game's settings not being accurate, and rectified that last one also affecting distant shadow quality readouts.</p>
<p>As for how much these fixes have improved things performance-wise for PC Wilds, the verdict so far looks to be a bit mixed, with some folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0yeu/title_update_2_is_good/">reporting</a> that things are generally better and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0i4v/framerate_issues/">others</a> still seemingly running into crash and frame rate problems.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues]]></content:encoded>
