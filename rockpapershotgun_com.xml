            <p>If you're sick of being tag-teamed by Gaping Jaw &amp; Darkdrift Knight, then I bring good news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s next wave of enhanced bosses have now successfully RSVPed to the big darkness party. They'll be arriving when the next cycle begins on July 31st.</p>
<p>Sure, that was the most logical point for a fresh rotation, given it's when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-enhanced-boss-has-arrived-kicking-off-weekly-big-baddie-visits">established lot of Everdark Nightlord duos</a> were set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">disappear</a>. Though, for whatever reason, FromSoft haven't fully committed to a date until now. One can only assume the Equilibrious Beast was busy polishing its horns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, as the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s about rolling around the big lad until one of you expires have just tweeted, the enhanced versions of Tricephalos, Augur, Fissure in the Fog, and the goat-headed beast I just mentioned will be arriving as part of a cycle starting on the final day of this month.</p>
<p>So, they're really August bosses, but they're doing you a favour and rocking up to the party before the first of the month. Early boss gets to slap up the worm with an underwhelming build, I guess.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The veil thins, and the Night hungers still.</p><p>On July 31, 2025, a new Everdark cycle shall begin; the enhanced Nightlords Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will soon unleash their darkest powers upon Limveld.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> <a href="https://t.co/IN71Mm53ux">pic.twitter.com/IN71Mm53ux</a></p></div>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If they follow the same cadence established by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-latest-elden-ring-nightreign-enhanced-boss-is-plenty-tough-enough-without-the-everdark-treatment">first wave</a> of Everdark Sovereigns, you can expect three weeks of one new boss invading at a time, then three weeks when you can take them in pairs. Is that enough to keep you Nightreigning without some more juicy additions, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">already confirmed duos mode</a>, currently in sight?</p>
<p>Well, if you're desperate for ways to spice things up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling">a randomiser mod for Nightreign</a> came out earlier this week. Nothing like taking your chances with a map structure that may or may not be balanced, eh? Maybe blindfold and truss yourself up like Hannibal Lecter too. Can't make thing easy by being able to see or touch things as you try to beat the bosses, can we?</p>
<p>Better plug up your nose as well. No hunting bosses by smell unless you want the FromSoft lot sniggering at the amount of training wheels you're running with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-enhanced-boss-wave-crashes-against-the-shores-of-frustration-at-the-end-of-this-month]]></content:encoded>
