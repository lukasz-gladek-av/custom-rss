            <p>
In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>
"Superbesque!" I breathed, watching myself casually tear off a violin solo to magic open a door. "Magnifissimos!" I sang, watching myself artfully bounce my violin bow off the floor and catch it to double-jump. "Bravanche!" I honked, watching myself evaporate against some spikes. While it's not a metroidvania, the cavernous, lamplit, whirring set-dressing puts me strongly in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and the eternally-forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Here's a trailer:

<p>
And here's some backstory: the aforementioned very fancy violinist is Philemon, who must gather the members of an orchestra and restore vitalising music to a world that has fallen into deathly silence. The levels and backdrops are a phantasmagoric, almost Cubist portrayal of instruments collapsed together into halls and shafts - I am keen to see more of them. Hollow Knight aside, it all reminds me just a little of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and Oddworld, which probably aren't the parallels developers Sunny Peak are going for. I mean, I assume there isn't an abbatoir level, but perhaps that's where they get all the catgut. </p>
<p>"Each area in Symphonia has its own distinct feel and characters, and each room is hand-crafted," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865960/Symphonia/">the Steam page adds</a>. "Meet prodigious musicians and try to convince them to join the orchestra."
</p>
<p>
And then there's the score, a bespoke piece of classical romance music, written by composer Olivier Esman and his partners Alexandre Bucas-Français and Lou Corroyer. As regards the demo, at least, it's gently synched to your progress, with certain actions triggering the next movement. You'll also perform full-arsed concerts at intervals that are dedicated to a particular section of the orchestra - Strings, Brass and Woodwinds. I deduce from this that the game has a three-act structure.
</p>
<p>
Symphonia is out... now! And feels like a good festive pick if your idea of festive is a soothing melange of velvet, mahogany and candlelight. And spike pits. Here's some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYN1d3f2dc">Disney's Fantasia</a> to wash it all down.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/short-trip-browser-game">First covered by Alice O</a> (RPS in peace) in 2017, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Short Trip</a> was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it's out on Steam. Not only that, it's arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added "scheduled mode" that adds more charm to an already lovely game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hand-drawn "over five years", Short Trip is the work of developer Alexander Perrin. And in it, you use the left and right keys to drive a tram across a sketched mountainscape. As you trundle past trees and nice cottages, you'll drop off cat passengers and pick up new ones. There's no ultimate aim here, besides chilling out, absorbing the wonderful aesthetics, and feeling more zen once you've had your fill.</p>

<p>The new "Scheduled" mode syncs up with your computer's clock to create a "tram timetable". This means you'll need to reach each station at the right time, with a view to chasing a high score. I imagine this takes away a little of the zen, but then again, nobody's forcing you to play the mode. Who needs to follow a timetable, anyway? I know that UK-based trains certainly don't.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that you can still play the free web version over on <a href="https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/">Alexander Perrin's official site</a> - it just won't contain the new scheduled mode.</p>
<p>Short Trip looks like a really nice way to decompress and you can find it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187700/Short_Trip/">Steam here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.</p>
<p>The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.</p>

<p>Hayter and Hale aren’t the only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> actors that read for parts across the Legacy Of Kain series. There’s also Colonel Campbell’s Paul Eiding as the Elder God, Liquid Snake’s Cam Clarke as Blood Omen 2’s Marcus, and another Raziel reading by Psycho Mantis’s Doug Stone. They’re all fantastic, of course, although it’s hard to imagine Soul Reaver voiced by anyone else. You can toy with fate, chronology, and destiny, but you don’t <a href="https://youtu.be/4DOKzTHaPfM">mess with perfection</a>.</p><p>Noclip’s entire documentary is very much worth a watch, featuring interviews with the series’ art director Daniel Cabuco, programmer Scott Krotz, and also Ben Starr for some reason. It’s a great reminder how much technical wizardry and clever comprimises went into getting Soul Reaver running on such limited hardware.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered released yesterday, and seems to have had a broadly positive reception.

I’m a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ode-to-kain-from-blood-omen-and-his-legacy-including-untitled-goose-game">Blood Omen hipster</a>, of course, but the entire series means a great deal to me.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> has joined <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-selling-refurbished-steam-decks-and-theyre-dirt-cheap">Valve’s Certified Refurbished</a> programme, offering a much cheaper way of getting your hands on the best handheld PC around. Provided you don’t mind it being in someone else’s first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, "certified" Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished" target="blank">put back on the market at steep discounts</a>. You’re looking at £389/$439 for the 512GB spec and £459/$519 for 1TB, down from £479/$549 and £569/$649 respectively.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve not used one of these freshened-up Decks myself, but I have had broadly good experiences with professionally refurbished tech – a gamepad here, a monitor there – so I’ve nothing against the concept. Especially when it makes the already-worthwhile Steam Deck OLED even more attainable, next to increasingly pricey rivals like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. There are, however, a couple of catches. One, this doesn’t include either of the limited edition OLED models Valve have released, including that eye-catching <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">white version</a>. And two, stock availability is going to be unreliable. Both 512GB and 1TB variants are currently out of stock in the UK, though the US seems to have some still going.</p>
<p>The problem is that supply is wholly reliant on Steam Deck OLED owners returning their on-the-fritz handhelds under RMA. The more that selfishly continue to work normally, the fewer opportunities there’ll be to pick up a certified refurb at a bargain price.</p>
<p>As such, if this deal does interest you, it may need to be... <em>provoked</em>. Here are some ideas on how you can get the process moving along:</p>
<ul>
<li>Befriend a Steam Deck owner, then Sellotape over the rear air vents when they aren’t looking</li>
<li>Start an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/fake-restaurant-tips-on-reddit-a-reminder-of-google-ai-overviews-inherent-flaws/">Angus Steakhouse-style psyop campaign</a> wherein you convince Steam Deck OLED users that it will run faster if fully submerged in a vat of ghee</li>
<li>Walk up to people in the street, slap their Stream Deck OLED out of their hands, then run off laughing</li>
</ul>
<p>You're welcome.</p>

<p>"This action became necessary as external market pressures persisted beyond our forecasts," writes chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski on <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1866531267464007759">Xitter</a>. "The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game."</p>
<p>Based in Warsaw, People Can Fly date back to 2002, finding early success with FPS Painkiller. They collaborated extensively with Epic Games during the noughties, and became a subsidiary of the Gears studio in 2012. Since splitting from Epic in 2015, they've expanded significantly, founding a satellite studio in Newcastle in 2017, another Polish studio in Rzeszów in 2018, and a fourth studio in New York in 2019. They became a public company in 2020, subsequently acquiring Phosphor Studios, Game On, and Incuvo Studios. By 2023, People Can Fly had over 600 staff, with seven projects on the books that July.</p>
<p>But People Can Fly haven't escaped the industry's on-going economic troubles, which have led to thousands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> this year as company leaders "realign" in the wake of a gaming boom created by pandemic lockdown conditions. In January this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">dismissed 30 developers</a> who were working on an unannounced Square Enix game. In April, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">announced the cancellation</a> of a co-op action-RPG codenamed Project Dagger, which was once to be published by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> company Take-Two.</p><p>People Can Fly's last release was Bulletstorm VR, an updated, magic-headset version of the shooter in which you boot mooks into cacti or swing them around with an energy leash. In theory, their next one will be Project Gemini, which is expected sometime in 2026. Best of luck to everybody who has lost their jobs this week, just a couple of weeks before the seasonal holidays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a>.</p>

<p>As Graham recently touched upon in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naiad-review">brilliant Naiad review</a>, relaxing games mean different things to different people, and it’s often those with more demanding rules and consequences that feel realer, more engaging, more emancipatory. Some of my favourite winter gaming memories in recent years were stocking up on Shin Ramyun for a glorious fortnight spent popping heads in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, or spending weeks in an unwashed Oodie exploring Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. A happy place in which you brain goons with bicycles is still a happy place. The happiest place, even.</p>
<p>But I also love reading about all how games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> have meant so much to so many people, even if it's never quite caught me the same way. That’s more towards the self-consciously ‘cosy’ end of the spectrum, but I think something that maybe gets underrated when we talk about games and mental health is what how powerful it can be to have access to a clearly-defined set of tasks that are manageable but still rewarding - something that offers structure and accomplishment when doing anything realer feels too overwhelming to contemplate.</p>
<p>There are also just the games I think we all have, the ones we know we can return to pretty much whenever we need them for a joyous escape. Games that feel wintery and warm. For me, that’s 90’s PlayStation JRPGs: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Wild Arms. Grandia. So, how about you? Which games help you get through the winter? Or, if you love winter - and despite it all, I sort of do too - do you have some winter gaming traditions that just feel as if they suit the season? Do tell!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While it’s always worth starting a new game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> just to hear Judy say "his own choomba shot him!" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/">on Steam</a> until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: <a href="https://youtu.be/5SX5CJ2hN_c">worth it for the line</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/514069779412157218">full patch notes here</a>. Alongside the fixes, and a tantalisingly vague "more secrets to discover in Night City”, the headline items here are all centered around customisation i.e. making you and your car look cooler in photos i.e. the true endgame. There are lots of fancy trademarked brand names I’ll save for the patch quotes, but the upshot is that you can now customise the colours of several new car brands, including by scanning other cars you like the look of and paying a small fee to copy the colours to yours.</p>
<p>There are also ten more cars available to buy, and Johnny will sometimes appear in the passenger seat after the first act to "comment on and react to what's happening" (driving):</p>
<blockquote><p>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</p>
<p>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to gain in popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d make a comment about how the ‘obnoxious Cyberpunk advertising’ bit doesn’t really work when you’re actually selling something but I think we’re probably way past that point. As for character customisation, they’ve added a lot, including 32 eye colours, 4 scars, 8 cosmetic bits of face cyberware, and 2 body tattoos. Amusingly, there’s also a new "Plain-to-Punk slider" that'll let you easily tinker with your corpo-to-rockergirl ratio.</p>
<p>Here's a few PC-specific additions too.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>So, all in all a good time to pick up Cyberpunk if you’re still holding out, but that’s been progressively truer with each patch, culminating in a great expansion. Here’s Graham’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> review if you’re still on the fence. "If you've never played Cyberpunk 2077 before and buy the expansion, Phantom Liberty is an absurdly lush, thrilling, 20-hour-long side quest," wrote he. "If you have played it before, it's an unmissable opportunity to check in on old friends, and to make a few new ones, in Night City."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
