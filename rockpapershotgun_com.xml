            <p>Of all the "what if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but" projects on offer, there are surely none so atrocious and indecent, so utterly irresponsible of conception and offensive to human dignity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdigo">Birdigo</a>, which bills itself as "what if Balatro, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wordle-past-answers">Wordle</a>". For the uninitiated, Balatro is the rad poker roguelite that took the games industry by storm in 2024, while Wordle is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3lcj645f27c24">what the New York Times do now</a> instead of articles.</p> <!--more-->

<p>Before you NYT sympathisers accuse me of riding far too high on my already stratospheric high horse, let me confess that a significant percentage of Rock Paper Shotgun's daily eyeballing comes from Wordle guides. I'm not saying that I sleep on a bed of Wordle guides, but if I had to stuff a mattress with any RPS content, it would be that. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>. The idea of these two games forming one game makes me feel like I'm watching a stellar collision, and that's before you consider the birds. Combine Balatro and Wordle, and you get birds. These are the puns that cause our parents, children and employers to stop talking to us.</p>
<p>Birdigo is the brainspawn of John August, scriptwriter for Corpse Bride and Charlie's Angels, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonfire-peaks">Bonfire Peaks</a> developer Corey Martin. Apparently it all started on a podcast. Nothing honourable ever begins with a podcast. The basic mechanic is assembling letter tiles to make words, which earn you "flaps" with which to fly a flock of fidgety, boggle-eyed wildfowl around the world. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3264170/Birdigo__bird_word_game/">The Steam page</a> acknowledges Scrabble as a third influence, here. If they were <em>true</em> artists, they'd have incorporated that into the title pun, but I guess they couldn't think of a SFW narrative theme for a game called Birdigrabble.</p>
<p>The Balatro element, meanwhile, takes the form of multipliers and modifiers which let you jimmy the basic scoring system. "Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses," the Steam page comments. "Use enchanted feathers, letters and songs to change the rules of the game as you go." All japes and jeering aside, I think this is probably quite fun. It's out 30th July, and you can find a demo on Steam.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-end-is-nigh-for-balatro-and-wordle-have-had-a-terrible-avian-child]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a>, the latest wonderfully weird game from Swiss devs Playables, will turn you into a fly. I mean, the clue was in the name. You live for a matter of seconds every playthrough, and in that time, you've got a bug bucket list of stuff you can do.</p>
<p>You'd better not screw around. Or you'd better get on with screwing around. Either way, this cool cousin/sibling to the equally bizarre <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fine-2018-games">Kids</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-my-exercise">My Exercise</a> is coming out on PC July 31st.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die," reads Time Flies' Steam description. It's not wrong. It's hand-drawn world has "delightfully accurate fly physics", "numerous intriguing ways to die", and "grimly variable life expectancy based on player location".</p>
<p>If you want more info on that last part, artist and director Michael Frei explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/time-flies-lands-on-ps5-on-july-31/">PS Blog</a> that how long a playthrough of the game lasts depends on what average life expectancy according to the World Health Organization is in your region of the world. For example, if you're in the US, the game'll register that figure to be 76.4 years and give you 76.4 seconds to play before your fly dies. So, it looks like those of us in the UK'll be getting <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/826">about 80.1 seconds</a>.</p>

<p>In that time, you can accomplish bucket list goals by doing everything from getting drunk, to learning an instrument, to making someone laugh, to reading a book. Or you can try to find god, something Frei discusses in that blog post. Or you can just roll with it.</p>
<p>"What to do in this world before you die? That is a difficult question to answer," Frei wrote, "Luckily, the game contains a list of things for you to do. All you need to do is figure out how to do them, and then do them all within one lifetime. It might seem impossible at first, but you can die trying, and eventually you’ll get the hang of it. It is a game about life, but you get many chances."</p>
<p>Sounds equally filled with fun and existential dread to me, and I'll definitely be adding it to my list of things to do before I eventually expire, likely just before getting to the DLC in my millionth Fallout New Vegas playthrough.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/time-flies-is-about-a-bug-finding-god-or-learning-guitar-in-something-like-764-seconds-and-its-got-a-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The second of two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> updates Bethesda told us all they had up their buggy sleeves arrives in Steam Beta later today, July 9th. This one's update 1.2, and it's headlined by the sorts of performance improvements folks have been begging for, plus some difficulty setting tweaks.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Elder Scrolls 4.something's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-has-two-bug-fixing-updates-coming-sudden-glitchy-vampire-baldness">last update</a> did many things, but by fair the most noteworthy was stopping a vampire from succumbing to the urge all men get. That being the urge to become bald so you can save like £10 a year by no longer buying shampoo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for update 1.2, which you can check out in full via the Tweet embedded below, Bethesda's kicked off by outlining how it's switched up the settings that control how hard you get Mehrunes Donkgoned by enemies and how much damage you inflict by donking them back.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," they wrote. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players." I personally preferred yanking the slider on a bar that provides next to no info as to what exact difficulty you're at, but hopefully this helps folks out.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, here are the much-requested tweaks the update makes to Oblivion Remastered's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">not always so hot performance</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>
<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>
<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>
<li>Optimise updating of character attachments.</li>
<li>Optimise rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>
<li>Optimise light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>
<li>Optimise waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>
<li>Optimise the weather system.</li>
<li>Optimise character animation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully all of that means you get more of the fun jank, and less of the jank that is the equivalent of a stranger taking a big poo on your living room carpet. Unless, of course that is your definition of fun. To each their own.</p>
<p>The update's out via Steam Beta first, with a full release on PC and those other platforms to follow at some point down the line.</p>

            <p>Back in June, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of alleged undocumented migrants in Los Angeles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests">provoked a wave of protests</a>. The Trump administration attempted to make hay from the situation, dispatching federal military troops to the city in a show of toughness, against the objections of California's own governor. Despite this cynical cultivation of a pressure-cooker atmosphere, the majority of protesters were peaceful, albeit justifiably loud and angry at having their neighbours seized and imprisoned by random thugs at the behest of a dime store Palpatine.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I was in Los Angeles at the time covering Summer Game Fest, and saw a few of the protest marches up close while walking across the city. Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police">a good, longer report</a> on the unearthliness and angst of attending a game expo right in the middle of such events, including comments from other journalists and developers.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles protests and the Trump administration's wider policies on immigration have provoked additional demonstrations across the USA. They've also inspired an Itch.io charity bundle, <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california">"No ICE in California"</a>, which spans 560 video games, physical games, game asset packs and other items from 268 developers for $10. Hosted by jesthehuman, the bundle has raised $26,712.19 as of the time of writing, with proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.immdef.org/">Immigrant Defenders Law Center</a>, a Los Angeles law firm who specialise in defending immigrant communities, and <a href="https://raicestexas.org/about">RAÍCES</a>, a Texas-based immigrant advocacy and support organisation.</p>
<p>As is RPS tradition, I've picked out a few bundle highlights. <a href="https://linker.itch.io/eleflipside">Elephantasy Flipside</a> (pictured) is a glorious isometric single-screen puzzler, the kind of thing I'd have had kittens over if I'd found it on a MacWorld shareware disc, back in the 90s. <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a> is a crushed and grimy immersive sim in which you are a knife-wielding cockroach. <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">Periphery Synthetic EP</a> is a set of reactive, musical solar systems that can apparently be explored using echolocation and terrain sonification, if you're too cool for screens. And <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/centauri-dark">Centauri Dark</a> is a gut-emptying rainbow of a bullet hell FPS.</p>
<p>Got highlights of your own? Please share. Beware that if you've bought other Itch.io charity bundles, you may own some of these games already.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-charity-game-bundle-raises-funds-to-defend-us-immigrants-against-ice]]></content:encoded>
