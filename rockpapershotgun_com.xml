It's been 10 years since Fatshark's Warhammer Tide years kicked off, starting with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: End times - Vermintide</a>, and to celebrate that anniversary the developer has been offering up various in-game events and updates in both Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> received a free new level, a point we'll come back to, but the big thing you should know first is that you can pick up the co-op dark fantasy game for free on Steam right now, and keep it forever.
</p>
<p>
Literally all you need to do is head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">Steam page</a>, and add it to your library. Easy as pie, cheap as chips! Or cheaper than chips, I suppose. As a word of warning, don't dilly dally on picking it up if you are interested in checking out the game. The offer is only running until November 24th, in a couple of days time, according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/600795607306601669?l=english">Steam blog post</a>, so best get on it right away.

Anyway, that new level! It's called Return to the Reik, and it's already available to pick up, again completely for free. This one should be familiar to those that have played the first Vermintide, as it originally featured in that game. In the Vermintide 2, River Reik now apparently has "expanded, boat‑focused gameplay." As you can see in the above trailer, that does involve some boat on boat shenanigans, complete with the game's usual combat. Looks pretty neat!
</p>
<p>
There were a few fixes, tweaks, and features added in with this new level too, which you can read about in this other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546748595947175982">Steam blog post</a>. Happy vermintiding!
