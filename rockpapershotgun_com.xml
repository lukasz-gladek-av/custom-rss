            <p>Very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tamriel-man-skywind-squeezes-morrowind-into-skyrim">long-in-the-works</a> Elder Scrolls modding project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skywind-releases-long-new-trailer-for-morrowinds-21st-anniversary">Skywind</a> has hit another milestone in its winding road towards an eventual release. The folks behind the mod, which aims to deliver a version of the series' beloved third entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> remade in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, have recruited the final three voice actors they were looking for to fill out the base game's entire roster of characters.</p>
<p>Skywind's still without any kind of release date, meaning it's almost certainly further off than its Oblivion-centric sort of cousin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, which is aiming to arrive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">this year</a>. However, the regular updates we've been getting about it of late are encouraging signs that it will eventually let us into its heart chamber.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The team behind the mod have taken to the socials to announce that they've now cast voices for every character in the base game. "Roughly 300 voice actors are lending their voices to give life to the approximately 3000 NPCs of Vvardenfell," the modders explained, "and we are looking forward to you all hearing them on your adventures."</p>
<p>Given that scale, you can see why it'd take such a gargantuan effort to bring together enough dulcet tones to fill the voice boxes of everyone from Alvis Teri to Zabarbael. The final three characters the Skywinders were looking to find voices for weren't exactly minor roles either. As the team explained in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wWpMR5mo-w">most recent showcase of the mod</a> back in May, Dagoth Ur, Vivec, and Yagrum Bagarn were the trio left communicating via silent text.</p>

</span></p><p>Jeff Baker's performance as Dagoth's only one of the most iconic things about the original Morrowind, how tough can it be to fill those god-sized shoes? Well, I'd certainly not want to be the one tasked with bellowing at Nerevar to come and look upon the heart, and Akulakhan, and bring Wraithguard please, because I have need of it. My work certainly wouldn't be god-tier enough to make folks want to stick synthwave behind it to form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-K2rUP86M">funky tunes</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, Moon-and-Star, the Skywind team aren't resting on their laurels having ticked this box, and they're still looking for volunteers to help out.

            <p>Buried in the fuzz of an otherwise unstartling <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">SSENSE interview</a> with Hideo Kojima, a sudden spike of violence. "People who are making military games, they probably don't know how to dismantle a gun or shoot a gun," said the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> man, in amongst pictures of himself dressed as various Minecraft skinpacks. "So that's kind of sad." Does Kojima know how to dismantle a gun? "Yes, because I've been doing this training as well, and I learned so many ways to kill people as well."</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pretty big talk for a guy who likes to go out on rooftops and cosplay as a sail. I don't know how to shoot a gun myself, Kojima, unless you count the sniper rifle I fired at a Sniper Elite press event in 2012, but I know a bazillion other ways of ushering my enemies off to the pearly gates, and only half of them are from Hanna Barbera cartoons. Here's a quick rundown to show you I'm serious business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a nice warm bath for my adversary in a copper bath tub on a very high hill under a very tall tree sprinkled with iron filings during a thunderstorm</li>
<li>Get all up in my adversary's grill and invite them to "step outside", while standing in a space station</li>
<li>Hack my adversary's internet history and expose their deep and abiding love of all the things they say they hate on social media</li>
<li>Exchange my adversary's favourite earphones for some carefully painted Black Widow spiders</li>
<li>Build a mile-long chain of dominoes of relentlessly increasing size</li>
<li>Paint very small images of calm blue skies on the inside of my adversary's flying goggles</li>
<li>Place a tactical guillotine on the other side of a fence with a hole labelled "free hat"</li>
<li>Photoshop evidence of my adversary playing patticake patticake with the spouse of the local mafia boss</li>
<li>Challenge my adversary to a friendly unranked game of "who can drink the most nail polish", then sportingly let them go first</li>
<li>Shoot them with a gun. How hard can it be. You just have to remember which end is the bangy one and wait for the button prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't much else of note in the interview. The second spiciest moment is the revelation that Kojima found this year's Summer Game Fest trailer deluge dull, presumably not including the trailer for his own latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. </p>
<p>"Even the visuals and the systems are pretty much the same," he said of the games on show, "and a lot of people enjoy this, I understand, but it is important to put something really new in there for the industry." I can't judge how "new" Death Stranding 2 is because Auntie Sony ain't put it on PCs yet, but I bet it doesn't let you kill people with dominoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Vid watching should now be easier to navigate and come with less sudden quality jumps</p>

            <p>If you're the sort of person who likes to take in plenty of trailers when you're hunting for new stuff to play on Steam, Valve have just put out an update that should make doing so a bit more pleasant. The pipe-themed platform operators have casually gone through hundreds of thousands of videos as part of an effort to make Steam's trailer player easier to use and less likely to run into hitches as it shows you the video games.</p>
<p>To put it how Valve do in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579723494031420">their news post</a> about the changes, they've improved the player's "interface and streaming to help you browse more quickly". So, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-redesigned-store-menu-is-out-in-beta-so-you-can-take-the-freshly-embiggened-search-bar-for-a-spin">Steam store revamp that's currently in beta</a>, Mr Newell and co want you to be able to zip around at the speed of sound.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Starting off with the new user interface, Valve say it'll be "more responsive" to whichever sort of clicking you're doing. For instance, it'll now automatically realise whether you're on desktop, mobile ("it even works well on iPhones now", Valve boast), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, or using big picture mode, then adjust accordingly. Jumping to different bits of a video will see you served a quick preview, while doing either that or hopping into full screen "should see fewer pauses and hitches".</p>
<p>Pretty obvious quality-of-life stuff there, but it's far better to have than not. To make the video streaming better, the Steamy folks say they've undergone what certainly sounds like a pretty beefy bout of scrawling through their trailer back catalogue.</p>
<p>"In order to update the streaming technology," they wrote, "we had to re-encode every trailer that appears or could appear on the Steam store. That ended up being around 400,000 video files." Oof. Holy admin, Batman. The result of that work is that these revisited trailers now have up to four quality options they'll automatically switch between based on how much net bandwidth you're packing at a given time, with the new player also adapting to different aspect ratios.</p>
<p>So, you're not guaranteed  1080p for every vid, but it seems you should at least get a version that's of decent quality and won't freak out if you do a single mouse click. Valve admit there are older trailers which are of very low resolution, but suggest they can do nothing about this because the original files are no longer lurking in Steam's system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the case with one of their own games in the original Portal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/">I've checked</a> and your options for that trailer are limited to 360p and 394p. Don't worry, you can still pretty easily make out the diagrams of toilet sign-esque person outlines being pointed towards colour-rimmed holes that'll spit them out somewhere slightly different.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-upgrade-steams-trailer-player-and-all-it-took-was-trawling-through-something-like-400000-videos]]></content:encoded>
