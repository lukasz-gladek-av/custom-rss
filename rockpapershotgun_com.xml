<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a> developers Inkle once pitched a Doctor Who game to the BBC, narrative director and writer Jon Ingold has revealed in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3m5sx6jiqps2i">a Bluesky post</a>. While the BBC never responded to their overtures, the pitch became the basis for Inkle's very excellent and bodacious astral archaeology sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven’s Vault</a>. I consider this a cool thing to know, and so do our friends at Eurogamer. They’ve just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-inkles-heavens-vault-started-life-as-a-doctor-who-game-before-it-was-exterminated">published an interview</a> with Ingold, which includes tantalising details of a forthcoming Heaven’s Vault reveal of some kind.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Inkle met with a number of potential collaborators in 2014, following the release of 80 Days. According to Ingold: “one of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on." The team spent eight months working on a pitch for something Who-flavoured and working-titled The Daedalus Effect. It would have been set on an asteroid orbiting a black hole, and would have featured time dilation. 
</p>
<p>
"For the art style, we wanted 2D characters within a 3D scene for a comic-book look, so we built a TARDIS interior model, drew some character art, and built a prototype where you could move around the console room," Ingold told Eurogamer’s Victoria Phillips Kennedy. "We also built a playable 'fly through the vortex' game for the travel sequences, inspired by Super Hexagon. And the most significant thing we did was start rebuilding the ink engine, from the very scrappy first version that powered 80 Days and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorcery">Sorcery!</a> series, to the more modern version that we eventually open-sourced."

<p>
Alas, the Who game was not to be: a decade later, Inkle are still waiting for a response to the Doctor Who pitch. This is possibly for the best, however. Heaven’s Vault is terrific, and Inkle are arguably in a stronger place for having embarked on their own original setting. "It opened Inkle up a lot - until then we'd be doing adaptations and IP-based work," Ingold noted. "Heaven's Vault was the first thing we did that was all ours - and people embraced it - and that experience is what made A Highland Song, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>, and all the rest possible."
</p><p>
Ingold isn’t sure they’d make a Who game today, fond as he is of that narrative jukebox, the Tardis. “I still love the character and the wild variety the concept would bring. But there's been a lot of Who games since 2014, and I feel like it'd be hard to capture the same excitement as we felt for the project when we first pitched it." 
</p>
<p>
Besides which, Ingold have their hands full with both a new videogame of some kind and a mysterious “thing”, possibly not a videogame, for the world of Heaven’s Vault, which has now expanded into the realm of novels and, potentially, stageplay. “We've written a pilot episode and outline for an audio drama version (though we haven't sold it to anyone), and we've got one other big thing cooking for the world which we haven't announced yet, but is hopefully going to be truly wonderful for new players and for fans of the original,” Ingold concluded.</p>
<p>You can read more on Eurogamer. Side note: I used to be an embarrassingly dedicated fan of Barbara Hambly’s Darwath books, and they have a wizard character called Ingold I would roughly classify as Sports Illustrated Gandalf. Science has yet to prove that he and Jon Ingold are not the same person.

            <p>There's a bit more excitement than usual, even among veteran car-watchers like me, for next year's F1 season. You see, the series is bringing in some <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/fia-unveils-formula-1-regulations-for-2026-and-beyond-featuring-more-agile.75qJiYOHXgeJqsVQtDr2UB">new rules</a> governing what its cars will look like and how they'll perform, meaning there's more potential on paper for serious changes to the established pecking order. Given that, I'm a bit unsure how to feel about EA and Codemasters having announced they're not making an F1 26, instead skipping ahead to 2027 with a DLC to fill the gap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Codemasters senior creative director Lee Mather <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">wrote</a> that this this call's been made as part of "a strategic reset" of the studio's F1 games, and stresses they and EA are "fully committed" to making F1 games going forwards. That last bit's probably in light of rally sim fans seeing this announcement and initially thinking '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">oh no, not again</a>', especially since Codies have released a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/formula-1">yearly F1 game</a> since 2010.</p>
<p>Instead of a new game for the first year of these new 2026 regulations, F1 25'll instead be getting a 2026 season paid DLC, which Mather wrote "will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers." Then, in 2027, there'll be a new F1 game that'll "mark the start of a new and more expansive F1 experience".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>On one hand, I've been on the side of yearly iterations of sports games often being pointless for years. Unless there are big changes planned, skipping a year and just doing a roster update to the last entry often feels like the better option for all parties except maybe the accountants. F1's a bit of different bag than ball sports, but taking a year to just see what the new rule changes do to the real world racing could well result in being able to simulate them better without as much of a scramble to react to anything unanticipated right out of the gate could be a similarly good call.</p><p>On the other, it'd maybe have made more sense on paper for F1 25, the last year of the current regulations which have been in place since 2022 and a season which has seen many teams skimp on current car development to concentrate on the all-new challenge of 2026, to be the year without a new game. Take a year to really have the developers delve into the new rules, and see if they can nail a fresh sim package and series revamp in time with them. Naturally, that assumes this pause was planned well in advance and hasn't seen me take into account any factors beyond what sounds good from the outside.</p>
<p>We'll see how it works out. As of right now, next year will be the first year in a long time I'll not spend part of digging into a fresh Codemasters racer.</p>

A grim and insanitary management game about absolutely abysmal cars? One for you, Brendy! Oh sod it, he's not here anymore. That's what we get for letting him learn how to drive - and letting him have a cell with a window. I don't know how to drive, and I have played neither <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> nor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, but I do know how to be a dishonest piece of shit, so I am at least 25% of the way towards writing an informed appraisal of Totally Legit Wheeler Seller.

Created by Polish developers Sombrero Labs, it's about making old, broken, patently unsafe cars look like new-ish, sellable ones by means of myriad methods. You can, for example, cut cars in half and solder the least rusty bits together, or paint tyres to look fresher, or photoshop some sparkle into your carefully angled phone pictures, or use an electric screwdriver to wind back the miles-counting... thingy. The best part from my perspective is that prior knowledge of actual car functioning appears inessential, to the point of being frowned upon. After all, the more you know about cars, the more you will understand why you shouldn't let anybody drive <em>these</em> cars.
</p>
<p>
If you do drive, I imagine you might enjoy this because it kindles memories of cars you shouldn't have bought as a foolish youth. Cars with suspiciously placed floor mats, and a raccoon nesting under the hood which the seller persuaded you was merely an atypically rabid and flea-ridden intake manifold. He probably charged you an extra £50 for that raccoon. Read more about Totally Legit Wheeler Seller on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3875690/Totally_Legit_Wheeler_Seller/">Steam</a>.
