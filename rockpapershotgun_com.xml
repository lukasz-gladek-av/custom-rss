            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only more bloody downloadable content for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. Developers Saber Interactive are supposed to be working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a>, but you wouldn't know that from all the Stuff they've jammed into the previous game's year 2 content schedule. There's a major Anniversary patch due on 4th September, just in time for Silksong. Five more patches are coming over 2025 and 2026, plus nine DLC packs via season pass. The manufactorums are overflowing! Here's a video to lay it all out.</p><!--more-->

<p>The standout upcoming option is probably the new playable Techmarine class, who don't get any screentime here. What is a Techmarine? A Space Marine with a lot of spanners where parts of their anatomy should be. They're good at fixing stuff, though one suspects that, like most Sparse Maureens in Spice Margerine 2, they'll spend the bulk of their time murdering things.
</p>
<p>Techmarines aside, the free updates will add new enemies, bosses, weapons, progression mechanics, PvE stratagems, Eternal War arenas, and operations. Also, the chance to play a Chaos Helbrute, which looks like a berserking tractor with a comically small humanoid head. It's like Bruce Banner got 90% of the way through Hulking out and ran out of rage. Still, let's see if you're still laughing when it stands on your toes in the forthcoming Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode.

<p>As for those paid DLCs, there will be the usual shower of cosmetics. The new battle pass kicks off with the Black Templars Champion Pack, which includes a Champion skin for the Bulkwark class and a Power Sword skin. Then there's the Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack, which comprises 40 new cosmetics. Future packs will include cosmetics for the Raptors, Iron Hands and Carcharodons. I'm pretty sure they made some of those Space Marine chapters up. Iron Hands, lol, as if.
</p><p>The only thing missing from Space Marine 2's roadmap, to my mind, is a mutual crossover with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> universe - a prospect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">once dangled by Arrowhead's CEO</a>, many moons ago. Let us make the commodified fascists fight! Let us see whose space-bigotry is burlier! Arrowhead have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-first-licensed-crossover-is-also-killzones-official-debut-on-pc-sort-of">partnered with the goose-stepping Helghast from Killzone</a>. Add Warhammer 40,000's Space Marines to the mix and you're basically playing an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planetside">PlanetSide</a> 3. Seriously, there's like, at least six battle passes worth of content here.</p>

            <p>You know what, I'm going to bare all: I've still yet to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> beyond the hour or so I played at a preview event, during which I approximately deemed it "a pretty tidy slice of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with some cheeky QTEs on the side", but certainly not the diamond-plated GOTY candidate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">described by Nic in his review</a>. As is my rotten nature, my desire to see what all the fuss is about is proportionately lower for knowing that they're going to make a sequel - or at least, some rather substantial-sounding DLC. Ugh, I have even more to catch up on now. Why do the gods mock me.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's according to creative director Guillaume Broche, following on from lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandfall-have-no-plans-for-more-clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-yet-but-chances-are-good-anyway">remarks in May</a> that "chances are good" that Expedition 33 will have some kind of successor.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4">Youtuber MrMattyPlays</a> this week, as detected by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">The Gamer</a>. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p>
<p>For context, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 takes place in a society that is being gradually obliterated by an all-powerful Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on her canvas, and everybody that age or older is wiped from existence. The titular expedition 33 are the latest in a series of increasingly junior warriors who set forth each year to slay the mad artiste. I don't know any of the story's endings, but I imagine there's scope, at least, for some melancholy prequel stories involving expeditions 34-75. </p><p>I know far more about the kerfuffle surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's development team size than I do the plot of the game. It's been repeatedly enshrined as evidence that smaller outfits are the magical panacea for an industry currently prone to laying thousands of people off. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wrote last year</a>, the much-quoted figure of 30 or so core developers is rather disingenuous - it ignores an external animation team, many of the musicians who worked on the killer soundtrack, and dozens of localisation, QA and voice production staff.</p>
<p>Geez fine, I'll play it already. It's not that long, right? Brisk little 30 hour campaign, yes? Nothing I need to take time off for?</p>
