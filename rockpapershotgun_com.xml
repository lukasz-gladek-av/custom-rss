            <p>
Sure looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is off to an alright start, 'ey? Success doesn't mean there's any rest for the wicked, i.e. a live service game, however. Just yesterday, only a day after launching, developer Embark Studios revealed their Arc Raiders <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025. It's light on details, but does offer a good outline for what you can expect at the very least.
</p>
<p>
In terms of ongoing additions and tweaks, Embark are working on new map conditions, feats, trials, and cosmetics, alongside some general quality of life improvements and mysteriously, "moreâ€¦" for the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. November, the month we suddenly find ourselves in, looks to be quite packed with additions. There's a whole new map, Stella Montis, which will bring the game to five total. Some "special themed community events" will be held this month (and in December) too.
</p>
<p>
A couple of new Arc machines will be introduced this month, called Matriarch and Shredder respectively. I imagine it's safe to assume that that second one will be looking quite sharp. On top of that, there'll be more quests, weapons, and gadgets to pick up too.
</p>
<p>
Then in December, a snowfall map condition will be added in - no prize for you or me for making an assumption that this one does what it says on the tin. There's also something called the Flickering Flames Event, as well as just a feature titled "Expedition Departure Window." You'll also be able to make your way through a new Raider Deck, and try your hand at even more quests.
</p>
<p>
That's the long and short of it, there is of course a promise for "more" which presumably will come in the new year. You'll need to wait a while longer to find out whatever that might be.
