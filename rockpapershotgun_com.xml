            <p>I have to write at least 250 words for a news post. Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. "Page 1 body content is quite short" it says if I go under. How cute is that "quite"? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blippo+">Blippo+</a>. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence. It's a "casual" "FMV" "Cinematic" "Pixel Graphics" "1980s" digital product from developers <em>also</em> named Blippo+, as well as publishers Panic, who've previously unleashed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">the horrible goose</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> on the world.

<p>I mean, yeah, I’m down. Panic haven’t steered me wrong before. On the wishlist it goes. How you doing, anyway? Got presents sorted yet? My mum doesn’t read the site so I can safely say that me and my siblings all pitched in to get her a Quest headset. I’m really excited. She still uses the PS4 VR to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> so I reckon this’ll be a lot less hassle. There’s not much I can give my mum that captures that feeling of like, actually being a 'toy', you know? But this is like, something she can play with rather than just appreciate the utility of another Le Creuset pot or whatever. So I reckon she’ll be chuffed. You got any good ones lined up? 275 words. Nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.
</p>
<p>Friends, it's time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Playing Skeal at Christmas is an annual RPS tradition, created by Alice O and written about by her in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-comedy-skiing-game">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-your-annual-reminder-to-play-skeal-this-christmas">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/merry-christmas-its-time-to-play-skeal">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-christmas-until-youve-played-skeal">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-reflects-the-power-pleasure-and-pain-of-all-our-christmasses">2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-we-go-ho-ho-its-time-for-your-annual-play-of-skeal">2023</a>. Alice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice0-is-leaving-rps-come-and-celebrate-her-work-and-make-lamentation">departed RPS back in April</a>, so I am continuing it in her stead.
</p>
<p>Skeal is a short, free joke created by Nick Cummings which you can <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">play in your browser</a>. It'll take you five minutes. Go do it now.
</p>
<p>Ah, that's fun, isn't it. A bit of silly wordplay blown up and out in a way that causes the delight to stack and multiply. Every year I forget the details of it, and every year I smile the first time I miss a gate and the "Pain" counter appears in the top left. 
</p><p>We play Skeal every year and invite you to do the same as a little marker in the closing season. I play every year, but in many ways the tradition begins for me long before I actually head over to Itch to find the game. It begins early in December when I first recall the tradition and start to sing around my kitchen. The mere thought of Skeal has become a prompt for reflection on where I've been and where I am. Briefly put? RPS, you remain my power, my pleasure, my pain.
</p>
<p>The nature of traditions is that we get to choose which we continue and which we don't. Alice O also played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rock-around-the-christmas-tree-with-dracula-cha-cha-and-christmas-pain-in-christmas-town">Dracula Cha Cha and Christmas Pain in Christmas Town</a> each December - fine traditions! - but I have let them go, for this year at least. 
</p>
<p>Of course, we likewise get to create new traditions of our own, should we want to. Who knows what Nic, Edwin, James and Ed might cook up in the months and years to come? That is for them to decide. For me, for now, I Skeal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Infamous evolutionary flop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.
</p>
<p>Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

<p>I drew comparisons with Spore, a game which tried to do everything, so I should stress that it doesn't look like you're directly creating the life that can wander about your planets. Instead, you seem to interact with the physics and elements of the solar system. For example, you can drag a cloud around to spread rainwater across the surface of a planet, perhaps turning it into an ocean world or simply making flowers grow.
</p>
<p>There's a playfulness to every interaction which I really enjoy. Don't like one of those flowers? Pluck it from the ground and toss it into deep space.
</p>
<p>It looks like a delightful playground, but there does seem to be some objectives and story to it. You're guided, somewhat, by a satellite called Curio, who apparently has some plan for dealing with the black hole that wants to devour everything. 
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet - and a lot of the footage used in the Day Of The Devs video comes from trailers released earlier this year - but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585710/Curiosmos/">follow the game on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a prequel to the excellent topdown action-RPG from 2016, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. The differences are myriad, given that Breaker is also 3D, open world, co-op and a roguelite. It also now has a release date for its launch into Steam Early Access: January 14th, 2025.

<p>The "Breakers" of the title are an organisation of warriors and explorers attempting to save the world after a war. What those Breakers do, and where its similar to its predecessor, is explore a world full of strange, abandoned buildings, with a plentiful sense of mystery. You'll also scavenge items that you can use to create your character build and change how you approach combat, and that combat is a mixture of ranged and melee with combos and parries.
</p>
<p>I loved Hyper Light Drifter, but it's always a worry when a game makes the leap to a new medium - and 3D, in many ways, is a different medium than 2D. Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/solar-ash">didn't love Heart Machine's last third-person action game Solar Ash</a>, and Edwin was not reassured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-3d-reworking-of-drifters-combat-is-promising-but-a-little-raw">by his Hyper Light Breaker hands-on</a> from back in March.
</p><p>"In general, I found my character to be unwieldy and a little unresponsive," wrote Edwin. "Equipped with dual knives and a pistol, they're one of several classes you'll be able to choose from in Breaker's final form, so perhaps I simply drew the short straw this time round. However, while the conspicuous recovery times of your attack and damage animations nudges you to memorise the inputs and avoid over-committing, Breaker's delays feel a little too drawn-out versus the overall floridity and fluidity of its presentation."
</p>
<p>I have hope in my heart (machine) all the same. It'll have had nearly another year of development by the time it launches, and it'll still be Early Access even at that. Plus, if Risk Of Rain can successfully leap into the third dimension, anything can.
</p>
<p>You'll find more on Hyper Light Breaker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/">on its Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
