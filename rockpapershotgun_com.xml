            <p>
In an ideal world, none of us would have to be bound by the rope called copyright, we could produce all the media we want about our favourite things, like that Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisend and Cinderella ship I have now likely made many of you aware of. Alas, this is not the world we live in, and because of that fact the team by the upcoming mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> Classic is having to rename it after a bit of a prompting from the original game's creators, Valve.
</p>
<p>
"As most of you pieced together quickly, Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic," the modding team explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040">Steam post</a> over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
"When we submitted our demo for Steam Next Fest, the review process was held up on IP rights. This was expected, and it had already happened to our main app, so we contacted Valve to get it cleared up. Upon doing so, we were met with the request to rename our mod. We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September."
</p>
<p>
Not being able to launch the demo led to the team focusing on the mod's rebrand, though apparently deciding on a new name was pretty tricky. Namely that was because they couldn't really find any other word apart from "classic" that conveyed what it needed to, and fit the same acronym of TF2C. 
</p><p>
Despite "Classified" not being considered seriously as a name to start with, as time went on, its double meaning, with the word's origin "classify" evoking "'to make something classic" and its literal definition," that lended itself well "into the spy film theming that early TF2 had carried," meant that it ultimately won out in the end.
</p>
<p>
Alongside all of this rebranding is one more bit of news, however: the mod has been delayed to January 30th, 2026. It's not the new name that's led to this, by the way, it's a few different reasons, including the classic need for more polishing and testing, but also because it'll need to go through the Steamworks review process.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about this mod yet, the main focus of it is to bring the classic (word choice purposeful) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more in line with its original inspirations and tone, bringing back things like some cut weapons and Multi-Team maps, as well as completely new features like new gamemods, items, and visual enhancements.

            <p>They might <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">not have committed</a> to making any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> ending the canon one, but the folks behind Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> have been quick to decide they'd like to get started on filming a third series as soon as they can. Summer 2026, if all goes well, so the radioactive glow of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">imminent second series</a> hasn't totally faded to background levels by the time a follow-up drops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So said executive producer Jonathan Nolan in a recent chat with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer">Ian Games Network</a>.</p>
<p>"With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," the producer outlined. "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all." He then added: "I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend. You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>Well, the conundrum outlined in that last bit sounds <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">similiar to another medium</a>, especially as the last couple of Fallout entries grow more and more distant in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>As it is, I'm not surprised that having been given the green light earlier this year Fallout's showrunners are keen to keep pressing on while they've got momentum. It's not like they'll need time to decide the basics of where the third series will go either, having sketched out some stuff all the way up to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fallout-tv-star-says-his-characters-plot-has-been-planned-up-to-at-least-season-5-or-6/">fifth or sixth season</a> according to Maximus actor Aaron Moten.</p><p>I am interested to see which location's next on the road trip list of Lucy and co, with the series now having done arguably the two biggest stops on the non Bethesda-developed Fallout tour - California and Nevada. Maybe it'll be off to the Midwest for some Fallout: Tactics deep cuts.</p>
<p>I jest, but to be honest if the trend of revisiting locations is set to continue, it'd be nice to see an entry that isn't already given prominent billing given a bit of a spotlight. I mean, most of the gear and props will likely still be made to look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-ish in the name of corporate synergy, but hey, I'm used to that by now.</p>

            <p>The modders behind <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">modding</a> project aiming to add a post-Oblivion-crisis version of the Imperial province to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s map, have given a lengthy tour of the latest city they've whipped into shape. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-skyrim-cyrodiil-the-full-imperial-expansion-from-the-devs-of-skyrims-massive-bruma-mod-gets-a-bird-chatter-heavy-teaser">teased the other week</a>, that city is Anvil, and it's certainly home to some quirky folks.</p>
<p>Just in case of confusion, what makes Beyond Skyrim different to both Bethesda's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and recently delayed Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> is that it'll be introducing a fresh cast of characters and stories to familiar locations from the fourth Elder Scrolls game. After all, by the time of Skyrim, Martin Septim and his contemporaries are long gone.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that existing Skyrim map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> offers a great early taste of what this group of modders can pull off, what's intrigued me most so far is the project's mission to wind forward time and tell new tales. After all, Oblivion's a nice game to retread, but I've seen the narrative it has to offer plenty of times at this point.</p><p>However, having watched a good chunk of that livestream embedded above, where the Beyond Skyrim team show off some of the stories and characters they've worked into Anvil, my feelings are a bit mixed. The city itself looks brilliant, having been expanded and given an architectural feel which blends Cyrodiilic vibes with the deserty aesthetic of neighbouring province Hammerfell.</p>
<p>The layout still invokes plenty of nostalgia, while Beyond Skyrim's team look to have arguably leant more towards zany comedy with the side characters and quests who pop up to newcomers than the notoriously eccentric Oblivion did. Upon first entering the city, you come across and encounter with two drunken sailors swimming in the town's pod. A guard jumps in to arrest them, and these two loinclothed lads sprint off through the city; according to the devs, the idea is that you might pursue their nearly-bare bottoms and do some sightseeing. Or, maybe you'll move on and talk to an Argonian named Left-Hand who randomly demands you tell him what 4833 x 76 is.</p>
<p>Maelorn, an older version of one of the two elven twins you might remember from Oblivion, is less on the weird side, since he just asks you a riddle and then reminisces about his life since the days of The Elder Scrolls 4.</p>
<p>Anyway, what grabbed my attention the most was a quest involving a kid called Jinol, which kicks off in Anvil bazaar about half an hour in. It's simply called Child Labour, and is about, er, that. Jinol wants your help setting up a business selling saltwater from the docks door-to-door, so you recruit other kids to act as runners. So far, so quirky little quest in terms of premise. The idea's that you gradually realise that you maybe shouldn't just be going along with trying to make a buck off some kids doing work an adult should be doing, at least if the Elder Scrolls' world is being kept a bit more on the 'fantasy' side of the 'medieval fantasy' coin.</p><p>There is one character, a merchant named Pavia Tara, who calls you out and asks if you've considered the ethics of your actions. However, at the moment the modders seem to have reduced her to being a one-dimensional scolding Karen, even if she does weave a bit of small business vs big business chatter into her rant, mirroring the city's wider themes.</p>
<p>There's a spot of tonal whiplash there, alongside the quest's very on-the-nose name. Then, we meet Franny. Basically, you and Jinol go and meet the owner of a big fishing company, Francis of Anvil. He lives with multiple wives in a house the devs say was at least in part inspired by the Playboy mansion. Franny literally goes "Child labour, why didn't I think of that", and offers to buy out Jinol's business. You help the kid decide whether or not this grown, multiple-wife guy gets to save money by relying on child labour.</p>
<p>The quest is mostly played for laughs, and I certainly don't think the goal is to make light of what remains <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour">a real issue</a> in our own world. Plus, the modders have aimed to make the kids essentially act like mini-adults. However, I'm not sure the quest strikes an effective balance between wacky/edgy humour, and making the player confront the morals behind what starts out as innocent fun.</p>
<p>As things go, it hasn't put me off Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil entirely – I’m still keen to see what other sorts of tales the modders have weaved into their work. But it wouldn’t be the first time a mod has mishandled controversial or delicate themes in an attempt at crafting fresh narratives, and while Jinol’s water distribution service isn’t anywhere near the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-the-frontier-goes-offline-after-modder-accused-of-sharing-animated-paedophilic-content">worst examples</a>, it is something I hope gets revisited. Maybe when they go back to swap all the placeholder AI voices for real ones.</p>
