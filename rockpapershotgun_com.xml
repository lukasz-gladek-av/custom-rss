            <p>'Weird' is one of those words I try to avoid because it usually just means "I'm not going to even attempt to understand or unpack the specific thing this is going for", but supernatural hotel renovator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</a> really stood out to me this evening for a tone that felt pretty singular in a weekend weighed down by soulslikes and shooters. Broadly, it looks like your Powerwash Sims and House Flippers, but with the added wrinkle that neither of the games feature dapper old gents crooning ska ditties at you. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>So, yeah: I'm into more or less everything here. The secrets and puzzles to solve between renovations. The ghostbustery multitool. The We Have The Specials At The Hotel soundtrack. The Wicker Man reference. The spiders stealing fire extinguishers and washing machines. It looks like a game with ideas, basically. And even if some those ideas are distinctly 'like that other thing', I dig the way they've been implemented. Also, one of those ideas is 'go for a motorbike ride with a cat'. Information's a bit scant on this one so far, but it's due for a release sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Double Fine's next game is called Keeper and it's about steering a four-legged lighthouse through a lush 3D world, with some puzzle-solving along the way. Its creation is being led by Lee Petty, who was previously project lead on Double Fine's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rad">RAD</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/headlander">Headlander</a>. There's a trailer below, which also brings news that it won't be long before it releases.

<p>Cor, it certainly looks nice, doesn't it? 
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/keeper-double-fine-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire post</a> doesn't contain too much more information about what you do in the game beyond what's shown in the trailer. It does mention that the initial inspiration lay in the pandemic, the isolation of lockdowns and the escape offered by walks in nature near where director Lee Petty lived. 
</p>
<p>Double Fine are most closely associated with company founder Tim Schafer, the creative lead behind their point-and-click adventures and more recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>. There are plenty of other creative leads at the studio though, and Alec and Sin previously enjoyed both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/headlander-review">Headlander</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rad-review">RAD</a> in their respective reviews.
</p>
<p>I don't need to know more. If it's fairly straightforward cinematic platforming in a world that looks like that, I think I'd be happy enough. And the release date - October 17th - doesn't leave much time left to wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
