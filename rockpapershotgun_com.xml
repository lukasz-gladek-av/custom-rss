            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a new update that makes copious little and large changes to the popular animal-hitting sim. As often with PC game patch notes, the changelog is a balance of mealy fare such as fixes for broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapons-tier-list">weapons</a>, and moments of absurdity, such as addressing a problem whereby you'd hack the tail off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">Ajarakan</a> only for it to transform into another monster's appendage. Also, you'll no longer be able to cheese the Gore Magala by somehow dropping a dozen boulders on it simultaneously.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update notes in question are to be found on <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">Capcom's FAQ for currently known issues</a>. The list of technical problems addressed as of today, 10th March include the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not unlocking, the Field Guide becoming inaccessible, players falling through the map during the mission "Toward Fervent Fields", NPCs not appearing in "A World Turned Upside Down", tutorials repeating themselves, Lance Power Guards and mantles not activating properly, Insect Glaive offset attacks causing your hunter to space out, force quits due to a screen rendering bug, and wait, stop! I'm just listing and rewording them all. So much for not letting the AIs take my job.</p>
<p>Let's skip to the highlights. Firstly, they've fixed a problem where "some environmental features such as floating rubbles" could be exploited several times. I've never managed this myself, but I've now looked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j7w7m1/floating_rubbles_you_will_be_missed/">a relevant player video on reddit</a> and well, that's not how you're supposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hirabami-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">to beat Hirabami</a>. Can't fault the effectiveness, though.</p>
<p>Secondly, they've nobbled that issue with hacked-off monster parts transforming into parts from other monsters - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j2xurg/monsters_dropping_the_wrong_parts/">see this video</a>, in which a dismembered Ajarakan obstinately poops out pieces of Gravios. I take a fiendish delight in this bug inasmuch as Capcom have accidentally gone full Monster Gacha machine. Monster Hunter is, in my experience, pretty gentle with its randomised loot drops, but who knows, perhaps this is secretly them testing a wonderful, magical omnibeast with three rotating eyes and one big arm you yank with your slinger to make assorted wyvern kidneys fall out the bottom.</p>
<p>The FAQ also spotlights a few Monster Hunter Wilds bugs they're still working on. These include network errors when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins, link members (aka, people you've formed a regular four-person hunting party with) not being prioritised when deciding which players appear in base camps, Palico blunt weapons failing to inflict stun and exhaust, and problems with your profile not being editable and certain side missions being unfinishable.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a Steam favourite. I confess, I've drifted away since last week, but that is simply because I am a news shark who must keep swimming forward to the next big release, or else succumb to a deluge of floating boulders. How are you getting on with it, if you're still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of my favourite things in the entire world is the brash poetry inherent in the word 'skyscraper', and the many writing and language lessons gleaned from considering how utterly mundane that word actually feels to use. This week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> community join me in the "probably thinking too much about skyscrapers" club. Paradox's city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> has turned ten.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/cities-skylines-anniversary">constructed a towering roadmap of freebies</a> for it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, including new radio stations, new content, and a free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665876198">Steam event</a> for the original running March 20-24.</p>

<p>Some<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/ten-years-of-cities-skylines"> blogly</a> musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build. With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much - and still has more to teach - and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cities: Skylines has continued to receive updates throughout the years, the most recent being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-latest-dlc-came-out-this-week-18-months-after-its-final-dlc-came-out-last-year">last October</a>. Its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">launched in a rough state</a> a year prior, though has seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">some improvements since</a>. It's also seen some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">controversy surrounding "rushed" DLC</a>, and still looks a ways off from overtaking the original in both popularity and reception.</p>
<p>Paradox have fessed up to misjudging the impact of Skylines 2's launch technical shortcomings. Players are now "less accepting that you will fix things over time," Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">told Edwin last year</a>, with CCO Henrik Fåhraeus commenting seperately that "we were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players." </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-nothing-beyond-this-point-except-a-promisingly-odd-metroidvania-about-exploring-the-void<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
One of my Foundational Video Games is <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/4498-mazeworld-the-ghost-of-mordaine">Mazeworld</a>, an elder Apple Macintosh first-personifier in which you explore a Carollian landscape of blue-walled darkness and rainbow-shelled snails. I was a young slip of a boy when Mazeworld released, and prone to daymares about crocodiles floating through the ceiling. Imagine my reaction to a game in which you are immediately confronted by a slathering, bodiless Cheshire Cat, its face a grinning smear that is only visible when it's charging right at you.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for games that similarly hide themselves, throwing you into a chasm of occult potentiality from which anything might emerge, given the appropriate rites. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a> and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nothing-beyond-this-point">Nothing Beyond This Point</a>, a topdown metroidvania in which you are a flaming cube surrounded by floating rods, dropped into a pixelart-scuffed void. RPS reader Mr_B recommended it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-324?view=comments">our last weekend plays thread</a>, and I couldn't resist trying the demo.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The aforesaid void isn't quite a blob of bad vibes, in practice. It has structure and the suggestion of an orderly grand design. There are 16 areas divided into tacit rooms, with reassuring fixtures such as campfires. There are genre-familiar activities such as having to clear a room of foes before you can leave it, or choosing between three permanent power-ups at key junctures.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of Enigma, however. Some rooms wrap around themselves and can only be exited from a certain side. Campfires aren't just "access points" and "save points", they're there to provide "a false sense of security". There are sigils that can eventually be interacted with in the form of a doodling minigame, altering the environment. There are also three gods to find, and the rudiments of coherent places. At one point a disembodied voice started talking to me in garbled Cthulhu language, alluding to a distant obelisk. 
</p>
<p>
The combat is also quite ingenious so far. Basically, you're immortal as long as you're surrounded by floating rods, which dissolve when you take damage and can be regenerated by holding space - which locks you in place for a fateful second or two. Rods are also spent to perform special abilities such as fireballs and AOE blasts, so battles are inherently tenser and more focussed on resource management than in a lot of vanias. Enemies consist of crawling horrors, sniper ghosts, and mallet-wielding machines.
</p>
<p>
I do get some sense that Nothing Beyond This Point will resolve eventually into a straightforward game of room clearance, levelling, and boss battles (I broke off playing the demo after I was slain by a robot-building robot) but then again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321280/Nothing_Beyond_This_Point">the Steam page</a> cautions that "you've seen nothing yet". Haha, I don't see what they did there. I wonder if they have a Cheshire Cat. I wonder if they have crocodiles. Argh.
