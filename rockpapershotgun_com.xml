            <p>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God Of War</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">a report</a> by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a> remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The natural worry here is that the decision will lead to layoffs. Sony confirmed the cancellations, saying they took place after an internal "review". However they wouldn't commit to an answer about employee job security, saying only that they didn't intend to close the studios. Meanwhile, a memo was sent in an effort to reassure staff, letting them know PlayStation would try to "ensure there is minimal business impact". The company would be working with the studios to figure out what they'll be working on next, PlayStation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfrztbks25">told Bloomberg</a>. </p>
<p>"Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family," they said in a statement to Bloomberg, "and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects."</p>
<p>Ominous. We didn't hear much talk about the God Of War game before now. But we knew something was afoot at Bend when they began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">hiring for staff with experience making blockbuster live service games</a>. Even at the time it seemed unusual for this single player studio to pivot to live service, but this is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">general trend chased by Sony</a> since 2022, albeit one they seem to be abandoning of late. The company have cancelled a few other live service projects in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">a multiplayer game based on The Last Of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">a co-op Spiderman</a> game. </p><p>Cancellations are fairly common in the industry, so arguably this is not that unusual. But it does look like the fear has truly been injected into Sony by hydraulic needle following the fate of online hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, a flop estimated to have cost the company at least $200 million, with the real cost likely being higher than that. That includes the human cost of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">all the workers who lost their jobs</a> when the studio was shuttered as a result.</p>
<p>Live service is an interesting monster in the grander ecosystem of videos gamesing. Huge corporations are attracted to the model thanks to certain heavy hitters like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> retaining a magical dollar-shitting ability for years and years and years. But they can be massively attention-demanding for the average player - how many of this type of game can you really play on the reg? My feelings about games-as-a-service is broadly in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">Edwin's recent eloquent scribblethoughts</a>. Here's a good part of that: </p>
<blockquote>Even before they became ubiquitous, live service games felt like a burden. They are inherently exhausting to think about. The business model is the experience in a way that it isn't for anything you "buy once" and theoretically enjoy in your "own time", away from the sludgepumps of commerce - it breaks the golden rule that art created under capitalism should at least feel like it's an escape from capitalism, by forcing you to think of playing as an on-going interaction with an evolving product.</blockquote>

            <p>Superheroes often conceal their identities behind masks, capes and in my case, a pungent snood-and-hoodtop combo that makes me look like I've crawled out of a drain. No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out <em>some</em> of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play. </p><!--more-->
<p>Well, get ready to be unmasked, you awful sneaks, because developers NetEase are planning to crack down on this duplicitous practice. If they catch you faking a pair of analogue sticks, they might even suspend your account.</p>
<p>"We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse," explains <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html">a post on the game's forums</a>. "This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features. Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter."</p>
<p>Perhaps you think you can slip the strong grasp of Justice by means of ratlike cunning. Fool! Ratlike cunning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin">the exclusive preserve of journalists</a>. And besides, NetEase "have forged a strong detection tool" which they will "couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters."</p><p>I know that it's written in character, but I'm slightly alarmed that NetEase feel it necessary to specify that their eyes are human. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Perhaps everybody in the office is an Ultron clone, and banning mouse and keyboard adaptors is all part of some globe-toppling Master Plan.</p>
<p>Even if it is, I can't argue with the point that tricksy M&amp;K bolt-ons give some users an unsporting edge. "We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players," the NetEase post continues. "Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be very popular. And chaotic, given that the entire cast are superheroes. This is a game in which everybody needs to feel like they could dominate. I don't envy the devs trying to distinguish the superpowered from the overpowered, let alone flush out the cheaters. If you missed it earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">they're planning to add two new characters a season</a>, so the balancing is only going to get more complicated from here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Friends, another soul is departing the RPS treehouse today. Ed has decided to lay down the mantle of reviews editor and rejoin polite society. Come join me in saying goodbye.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ed started at RPS back in 2020. He had been working on Metabomb, another site operated by RPS's then-owners which was closing down. We already knew how good a writer Edders, as we call him, was at that point - and what a lovely man, from chatting around the office - so we grabbed hold of him with both hands and didn't let go.
</p>
<p>You ought to know Ed's work by now. He's been reviews editor around these parts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/say-hello-and-welcome-to-our-new-reviews-editor-ed-thorn">for around 18 months</a>, but he was a senior staff writer for over two years before that. He <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-plant-carrots-in-valheim">obsessed over Valheim carrots</a>, mused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-ark-is-the-mmo-equivalent-of-grey-carpet">grey carpets</a>, and explained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-of-war-and-badminton-have-more-in-common-than-you-might-think">how badminton and Gears Of War were alike</a>. That last one is a favourite of mine, as is Ed's similar piece on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-two-years-kento-momota-had-the-best-game-in-the-world">his favourite badminton player retiring</a>.

<p>As reviews editor, Ed's been responsible for wrangling code from developers and words from the team and from freelancers, which is no mean feat. He's also written a cavalcade of excellent reviews himself. I'm most fond of his take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shin-chan-shiro-and-the-coal-town-review">Shin-chan: Shiro And The Coal Town late last year</a>, which drew on his personal history with Japan, or his frequent, breathless writing about his love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review">various</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Yakuza</a> games.
</p>
<p>You should also check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-oblivion-feeling">Ed's own reflections on his departure in a separate article</a>. It's a good trip down memory lane, at least for those of us who work here.</p>
<p>We've had more goodbyes than welcomes at RPS of late, but that should change in the months to come as we'll be hiring for a new reviews editor. Yet there will only ever be one Reviews Edders. Join me in wishing Ed an RPS In Peace in the comments below.
