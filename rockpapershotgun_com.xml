            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> scares me a bit. Ok, it scares me a lot. Here's this big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> MMO that's been growing for over a decade, adding layers upon layers of complex sci-fi lore and context to its imposing metal form.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you before googling it why one of my fellow article writers had declared in the chat for a recent press preview that Excalibur Prime users won't be spared when the revolution comes. I can tell you that its end of year 2025 update is called The Old Peace, and looks like it'll be a hoot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Old Peace, which developers Digital Extremes have just shown off a demo of at this year's edition of annual Warframe get-together TennCon, is all about "the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors" upon the Perita moon". The demo of it kicked off with the player fighting a huge robo-lad that turned out to be manned by a small robo-lady, who then accompanies you through events you're hallucinating via a Matrix-esque tech bath with <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus">The Lotus</a>, the mysterious figure who talks you through missions from the start of the game.</p>
<p>"You had the new war, you know about the old war," Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said of the update, "but now it's time to learn about the old peace, where, as with all wars, there was a moment in time when there was an effort for peace, a treaty. There was a time on Tau when things could have been different."</p>

<p>The Old Peace, which'll expand Warframe's focus skill tree and add in a new baddie faction, is bringing with it a standalone side story called The Devil's Triad that looks like it'll see you take on three scary bosses to earn a new warframe and a couple of new protoframes. The frame's dubbed Uriel, it's devil themed, and it's also the last warframe that the game's former art director Michael 'Mynki' Brennan worked on prior to his death from cancer in <a href="https://www.vg247.com/remembering-michael-mynki-brennans-warframe">October last year</a>.</p>
<p>Before all of that, the game'll also be getting an autumn update featuring a Lavos Deluxe cosmetic, a rework of the Oberon frame, and a quest called The Teacher. The latter's designed to teach you all about modding in Warframe, which sadly is of the adding stuff to gear in a game variety, rather than the downloading a thing that turns NPCs into Shrek variety.</p>

<p>Digital Extremes also announced that a standalone Warframe TTRPG module, made in collaboration with sci-fi dice game Starfinder devs Paizo and dubbed Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias, is launching in October this year.</p>
<p>Going back to The Old Peace, the very end of its TennoCon showing teases Warframe's future, with an update dubbed Tau coming in 2026 set to continue the game's current "Void War" story arc. "We have a very ambitious next couple of years [planned], to get the roots of Warframe and everything we're gonna need [in place] to continue this crazy journey," Ford said.</p>
<p>So, no slowing down in sight for the massive MMO's continued metamorphosis, even as Digital Extremes' other project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, inches closer to full release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warframes-2025-end-of-year-update-is-all-about-the-old-peace-as-hallucinated-via-communal-matrix-bath]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> remains nestled away in its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-warframe-devs-want-you-to-come-try-their-luxurious-fantasy-action-rpg-soulframe">closed alpha form</a> as this year’s TennoCon arrives. Despite plans to open that beta’s doors to a bunch more folks over the course of this weekend, developers Digital Extremes are keen to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>'s cottagecore sibling closed off for at least a bit longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that they have a bunch of new stuff they’re planning to unleash into fantasy land soon, as they continue to build a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe">strong fairytale-infused foundation</a> for the tale of the natural world clashing with technologically-advanced invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, if you've signed up for an account via <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">Soulframe’s website</a> to this point or do during the course of this weekend, July 19th to 20th, you’ll be granted access to Soulframe’s Preludes alpha testing, joining the fair few folks already running around in there. Given that’s likely to drive a pretty sizeable expansion of the playerbase, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair was asked during a press preview attended by RPS whether it indicates an early access release might be coming soon.</p>
<p>“We have ambitions, we have a few things…about our progression systems that are not quite in yet. We’re not comfortable doing anything open until those systems are in,” he replied, “So, it’s a great opportunity to join us and help shape that future, but we still have a few things we need to get in before we’re comfortable even trying that.”</p>
<p>While they’re still playing a bit coy with regards to timings on Soulframe additions, the devs did show off a number of features that’ll be arriving in the game soon, with the biggest being a new quest in the form of the Waste Bear fable. This got a big demo playthrough as part of the game’s Tennocon 2025 showcase, and it’s all about you being enlisted by a witch who is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur</a> levels of French to investigate the plight of a three-headed bear omen spirit called Bromius, who's struggling to fulfil his duty of caring for the trees.</p>

<p>There’s outside pollution that’s affecting him, some little woodland fellas called Sproutfolk that you’ll have to battle to save them from the corruption, and a boss battle you’ll have to trek through a new dungeon called the Neath’uns to face. If you want to know more about how it came to be and why it features a mini-boss who is brilliantly named the Wazzard of Wastes, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-director-chats-wiz-versus-waz-and-a-demo-he-hopes-will-help-prove-its-not-just-a-soulslike">our pre-TennoCon interview with Soulframe director Geoff Crookes</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the devs also teased the mote system that’ll allow you to unleash weird little woodland creatures on your opponents, expanded character customisation via the means to change your hairstyle, and some medieval-style martial arts manuals being added into the progression system to teach you skills like parrying. Plus, the promise of more stuff to do down the line in the form of extra Sparrow’s Tales, fables, and ancestor ghost people to recruit to your home camp, the Nightfold.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty cool, though that might just be me being easily swayed by the fact the bear fable involves you fighting a Wazzard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-getting-a-bear-quest-and-its-devs-want-you-to-keep-bearing-with-them-as-you-wait-for-it-to-emerge-from-alpha]]></content:encoded>
