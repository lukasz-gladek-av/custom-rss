            <p>Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/10-dead-doves">10 Dead Doves</a> when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">she wrote about it</a> back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. I have been pigeonholed.</p>

<p>Distinct from the implied narrative conceit mainly revolving around poisoned chips, 10 Dead Doves opens with Marcus - “the Most Pathetic Man on Earth” - going backpacking on the Appalachian Trail with his buddy Sean, searching for an urban-legendary place called “The Ant Farm”. Presentation is all medium poly papercraft and fixed angles, tank controls and all. It’s very odd and very fun. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/">demo here</a>, by the way.</p>
<p>This is likely part cop-out and part time constraints, but I feel the highest praise I can give what I’ve played of 10 Dead Doves is that I don’t feel I could adequately do it word-justice in anything less than a much longer article. I will say this: while I do not feel it’s attempting to be the indie game equivalent of an A24 film in any way, I do <em>feel</em> that my fellow A24 wankers will likely appreciate it. I’d compare it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a>, almost, in the way it uses the sort of camera techniques, spatial tricks and disorientating artistry that feel like they’re film specific, but are actually implemented in ways only a game could pull off.</p><p>If this sounds overly worthy or highfalutin, I should say that it’s also just very funny. Nothing sums up the scrappy avant-garde approach better than the devs singing the game title acapella over the splash screen. Some of the language used in the more eldritch sections is winkingly baroque, and the way the character’s faces dart jarringly between distinct expressions is brilliant. I actually didn’t finish the entire demo since I plan to grab this on release, but it’s shot right up for me as a must-play for the year. It’s a Columbidae-te, then. One for the massive cross section of ornithology enthusiasts and indie horror fans, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Complete <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>'s Space Age DLC and - feelings of acute megalomania aside - you will be able to upload a snapshot of your game to the "Galaxy of Fame", this being a digital night sky from which your cataclysmic industrial exploits shall gaze down eternally, for the instruction and/or disillusionment of tomorrow's factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The star map, which you can check out <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434">here</a>, is developer Wube Software's "last little surprise for Space Age", which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorios-space-age-expansion-is-out-now-adding-asteroid-factories-frostpunky-iceworlds-and-rotting-jungles">launched earlier this week</a>. You'll be prompted to upload your game to it once you've reached interstellar space. It lets you save general map info, such as time played, together with a chart view of planets and platforms and your item, energy and kill stats. You can update your solar system once you've enshrined it for posterity, but be aware that each player can only have one star at once.
</p>
<p>
"You can browse around and see other peoples factories and see how they work," the developers continue. "You might notice that some of the maps look a bit suspicious, well at this time we aren't blocking saves that use cheats/commands/editor, as we don't want to be overly restrictive, but we will add some filtering options soon." 
</p>
<p>
I'm posting this partly because a lot of people are playing Factorio right now - the Space Age DLC has gone down a treat on Steam - and partly because I enjoy fanciful attempts at preserving player accomplishments in games. The Galaxy of Fame reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_(video_game)">Noctis</a>, the amazing experimental space exploration sim with some of the loveliest prismatic effects I've ever seen in a game.</p><p>Released over two decades ago, it allowed players to name the planets they discovered and share them in the form of an old-school database. You can still <a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">download those files with the app and visit the worlds in question</a>. I wonder if Factorio's cyclopean assembly lines will command similar nostalgia, in 20 years time.
