            <p>You are leaving the mission area, soldier! Actually, the mission area is leaving you. It is sick of your shit. It has decided that your foxhole isn’t part of acceptable reality anymore. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s long-awaited battle royale mode seems likely to be revealed on 28th October. In less than a week, we could be laying eyes on the Battlefield interpretation of the well-worn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">Plunkbat</a> and/or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> premise of a vast map fringed by corrosive oblivion that shrinks over time, forcing scavenging players into a claustrophobic last stand.
</p><!--more-->
<p>A datamine of EA’s own app has disclosed (on <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">Xitter</a>, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/battlefield-6-may-be-getting-its-battle-royale-mode-next-week/">VGC</a>) a piece of content for next week’s Battlefield 6 Season 1 rollout called “Granite”. Which isn’t that revealing, but Battlefield 6’s developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">hitherto said</a> that they plan to begin the game’s seasonal update career with a touch of Fortniting, so the timing adds up. 
</p>
<p>“There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale,” they observed earlier this month. Friend, had you told me you were “ideating on new ideas” in-game I’d have gunned you down like a dog, possibly using the M357 Trait sidearm due to be added on November 18th. 
</p>
<p>We already know that Season 1 will bring maps, modes, timed events, vehicles, attachments, guns and melee weapons. The biggest thing missing from the current roadmap is that promised battle royale functionality. Again, the Granite shoe fits. I am interested to see what they call the mode - Battlefield Royale, Player Unknown’s Battlefield 6 and Battlefortnite are all there for the taking.
</p><p>I guess it’s possible that they’re literally adding some granite to Battlefield 6. I’d actually love to play a Battlefield game that blurs the lines with Minecraft in updating the levels with different materials. Possibly this is something you can already do in Battlefield’s Portal editor, when you’re not using it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">jumpstart the progression</a>.</p>
