            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta kicks off later this week, and EA have now painted a picture of what you can expect maps/modes-wise, as well as in terms of the changes the devs have made based on Battlefield Labs playtest feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, there's a new trailer that features yet more folks in camo running about amid booms. I'm glad to report that no helicopters, at least at a glance, look to have been harmed in the run up to this one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal last week</a>, the open beta will mainly run across two weekend-ish windows, August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th. Because big video game in 2025, there'll also be open beta early access running from August 7th into the first weekend, limited to folks who've subscribed to EA Play Pro or registered for Battlefield Labs before July 31st.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/everything-you-need-to-know-for-the-open-beta">the first weekend</a>, you'll be able to jump into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">three different maps and three different game modes</a>. Siege of Cairo will offer urban battles likely involving much crouch-walking, Liberation Peak takes you to the countryside of Tajikistan's mountains for what sounds like more open action with jet and chopper dogfight potential, and Iberian Offensive takes you back to tight streets, but this time in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three modes for that opening weekend are conquest, breakthrough, and closed weapons breakthrough. For weekend two, the Empire State map will be wheeled out so infantryfolks can thoroughly wreck Brooklyn, with rush and squad deathmatch also arriving to make it five modes in total.</p>
<p>Lest you think EA haven't taken anything on board from those who've already dived into the game's Battlefield Labs testing, the publishers have put out a full Tweeter essay outlining how that feedback's shaped changes for the beta and beyond. For this open play specifically, they want you to give a closed weapon conquest playlist a go as part of plans to let folks "choose between closed and open weapon modes", while maps like Siege of Cairo have had several aspects revamped with an eye to ensuring the flow of murder-deathing and balance of battles is closer to the ideal.</p> <div>

<p>The sorts of Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death debates that'll still be going on around multiplayer shooters in the year 5025 have led EA to balance damage "across the weapon pool". The weapon customisation menus have also been made more clear, and signature weapons have been introduced. The latter means, for example, recon classers will get extra advantages with the sniper rifles that I assume they'll be using to 360 no-scope fools from across the map.</p>
<p>More in-depth changes for all four of the game's main classes - assault, engineer, support, and recon - are already planned and detailed in the essay, but won't be coming in until after this open beta's concluded. That means you'll have to hop into more Labs testing if you want to try something closer to the "final adaptation" of the class system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app">ahead of release</a>.</p>
<p>Once the open beta's done, EA'll be putting out "an overview of further changes weâ€™re making on the road towards launch", because the tweakage can never stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Imagine Tetris but played in a bottomless ocean shaft, with linked tetronimoes serving to continue your journey down that shaft, providing you keep earning enough points to play them. This is <a href="https://fourquarters.itch.io/podvodsk">Podvodsk</a>, a free game jam experiment from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> developers Four Quarters. </p>
<p>Not played Tetris? 1) you bloody liar, and 2) let me frame this differently, then. The idea here is that you're trying to construct a tapering underwater city out of random clumps of building blocks, dangled from the bottom of a miraculously unsinkable surface platform. Each building both costs points and also, earns points based on different scoring criteria, and every time you play a piece, the screen scrolls irreversibly downward.</p><!--more-->
<p>Residential blocks score points based on whether they're close to other types of building. Factory blocks like to be positioned up against the walls of the chasm, so they can mine for ore. Business centres prefer to be a few squares away from other building types - financial analysts do enjoy a bit of elbow room, especially when they're 300 fathoms under. Seaweed farms want to be close to seaweed, obviously, while scaffolding earns you nothing, but is cheap.</p>
<p>My favourite tiles are bunkers, which can be drilled into the rock, and score points based on the number of other, on-screen bunkers they're linked to. Getting a vertical streak of bunkers feels like the key to transforming a mere Aquarius Reef Base into a credible Rapture. Science centres, meanwhile, earn points every time the screen scrolls for as long as they're visible, so you'll want to park them as far down as possible. And city centres, finally, give you the next three buildings for free.</p>
<p>It might feel like there aren't enough building types, but the game squeezes some decent intricacy out of these variations, and the pixelart is quite tasty. The real limitation, perhaps, is that too much depends on luck of the draw. As such, Podvodsk is best played in Tactical Mode, which stores any building piece you don't play for one turn, and thus allows you to strategise a little - placing scaffolding at first to move your seaweed farm closer to a bountiful kelp forest.</p>
<p>The relationships between scoring criteria remind me of wooden token game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/406660/seaside">Seaside</a>, except that Seaside sticks to the shore. If you're concerned about playing anything from a Russian developer, given the on-going invasion of Ukraine, it's worth noting that Four Quarters <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-loop-hero-devs-tell-players-to-pirate-their-game-because-of-sanctions/">have publicly opposed the war</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-underwater-cities-out-of-tetris-pieces-in-podvodsk-a-game-jam-freebie-from-the-loop-hero-developers]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of QA workers at Call Of Duty studio Raven Software have officially signed off on their first union contract with parent company Microsoft and COD publisher Activision-Blizzard, in the run-up to the launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The contract is the result of years of negotiations, and offers some protection against the treatment of QA workers as disposable staff - hired to quash bugs shortly before release and laid off soon afterwards, with minimal odds of personal development or progression to other roles.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to a release from the Game Workers Alliance-CWA - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">won the right to unionise in 2022</a> against the backdrop of Microsoft's efforts to buy Activision-Blizzard - the contract includes stipulations for the "elimination of crunch time", though "containment" is perhaps the more appropriate term. Managers will have to supply seven days notice of mandatory overtime, and give employees flexibility over scheduling. There will be "no excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks", or "mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>The contract also includes "a guaranteed 10-percent wage increase over two years with additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions". It makes provision for more "defined" job descriptions and a more transparent promotion process, together with "expanded disability accommodations, and layoff protections including severance, recall rights, generous COBRA subsidies, and career transition services." As <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won">separately reported</a> by Shannon Liao, the contract gives most of the QA team's 19, Wisconsin-based workers permission to permanently work from home.</p>
<p>"How do you progress within QA? How do you get promoted? How do you get a raise?" Autumn Prazuch, a Raven Software QA tester and bargaining member, told Liao. "For so long we haven't had those [answers], to be able to curate them with the company and come to an agreement... that I think is our crowning achievement, the thing that I'm most proud of."</p>
<p>Again, all this is the result of much hard wrangling with the big M, A and B. Last September, Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">interviewed CWA members</a> about different approaches to unionisation and how employers may try to thwart it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-qa-staff-secure-union-contract-with-microsoft-to-stop-them-being-treated-like-cannon-fodder]]></content:encoded>
