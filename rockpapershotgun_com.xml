            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>'s remake is near upon us, going by the Loud Noises online. Somebody's finally managed to get a response out of Bethesda regarding the much-tipped Oblivion comeback, and it is that special flavour of non-committal that attracts the true believers like wasps to a capsized icecream van. "We have no official information on an Oblivion remake," observed the company's Support staff in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1909296361503174761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1909296361503174761%7Ctwgr%5E874b2fca725c12b2e6308c72ab0ce2fe03d343f8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Foblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information%2F">response</a> to some nosy parker last week. "Apologies for any confusion."</p><!--more-->
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information/">The Gamer</a> for spotting the above. I've been avoiding a lot of the rumours because frankly, many of them read like people converting to <a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Unitology">Unitology</a> after stumbling on an extra-twisty Nik Nak. But there are now enough of them that I can mash them all together like I'm turning junk bonds into triple-A securities, and pass the results off as reporting. Seriously, though, there's quite a lot of smoke in the air. It feels increasingly like there's an announcement in the offing. Here's a quick round-up of the most substantial and/or recent pieces of gossip.</p>
<p>- Back in 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared</a> a 2020 planning document with details of several possible projects, including a new version of Oblivion.</p>
<p>- This January, MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">dug up a former Virtuos employee's CV</a> which makes mention of an Unreal Engine 5 Oblivion remake, detailing improvements to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking.</p>
<p>- But a few days ago, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game Of The Year Steam page <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/900883/history/">was updated</a> to remove some older trailers. Routine housekeeping?</p>
<p>- Jeff Grubb, a dependable disseminator of insider gossip, has claimed on Giant Bomb's 7th April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI">The Power Block</a> video that the reveal is definitely coming this month.</p>
<p>- <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">NateTheHate</a> claims the remake will be revealed <em>and</em> released this month, in comments green-ticked by <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1900289910801916177">Andy Robinson</a> of Vero Gusto Computing. Andy Robinson once beat me at Mortal Kombat in front of Netherrealm and I despise him to this day, but I have never known him to tell a fib about a video game.</p>
<p>If you're ambivalent about Oblivion, or disinclined to engage with anything Microsoft-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">in light of recent reporting</a>, you might prefer to check out certain community initiatives that take inspiration from Oblivion, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-gets-a-whole-gamejam-dedicated-to-persuasion-pie-co-hosted-by-a-dont-nod-developer">this persuasion-themed game jam</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jyh4fx/oblivion_remake_official_footage/?utm_name=web3xcss">this fun demake</a> co-starring Bethesda's indefatigable Adoring Fan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
