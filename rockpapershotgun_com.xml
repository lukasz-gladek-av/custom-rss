            <p>
I have to say, it does tickle me that pretty much anyone involved with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> just seem to still want to make Left 4 Dead. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-anacrusis">The Anacrusis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> both were made by folks who worked on the original co-op shooter, and now the original lead designer of it Mike Booth is back with yet another incarnation, 4:Loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-dev-mike-booth-has-teamed-up-with-jj-abrams-to-make-another-four-player-shooter-with-purple-aliens-this-time">revealed at Geoff's Ads and Statues Evening</a>. As part of that reveal, Booth took part in a little interview over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/">PlayStation Blog</a> where he touched on the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> mechanics, and how excited he is for people to break them.
</p>
<p>
Booth explained that he's been a fan of roguelikes since the original Rogue, and how the genre appeals to him because of the ways you can be creative in achieving certain goals. "Some runs even feel like you have such a great combination of tools that you 'break the game,'" Booth said, also noting that with 4:Loop he does still just want to let people "jump in and play."
</p>
<p>
We'll come back to that game breaking stuff in a moment, but first here's how Booth explains the core loop. Essentially, you and three of your buds need to try and destroy an alien mothership, with each mission you embark on letting you make different choices to improve equipment. Along the way, you might pick up certain items that help you out in tricky scenarios.
</p>
<p>
One such scenario Booth described was an instance where a playtester was trying to outrun a lethal beam of some sort that basically means game over if you can't get to the escape zone in time. Said playtester had picked up an item called a blink berry, which you can sort of throw like a grenade, and wherever it lands it'll teleport whatever it hits to somewhere random. So, the playtester threw it at themself, was teleported away, and made it to the escape zone in time.
</p><p>
"I built both of those game mechanics and had never even considered that strategy," Booth said. "I’m excited to see how our gaming community 'breaks the game' in other unexpected ways." Apparently there's bit of "meta-progression" where you learn things about the world and how it works that "give you an edge for your next run."
</p>
<p>
From the sounds of things it won't be a full-on roguelike, maybe more towards a roguelite, something to keep runs fresh rather than just taking hordes of aliens on over and over again. No release date attached to this one yet, so, just keep replaying Left 4 Dead like you I'm assuming you already do.

            <p>
When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a> was revealed back in September, it quickly became apparent how Simply Not Great this thing looked. There was way too strong of a "we have to make this thing look new and modern and well lit" vibe to it that did not go down very well with pretty much anyway. It even tried to convince us that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-deus-ex-remastered-i-simply-do-not-believe-you-need-an-rtx-2080-to-run-at-recommended-settings">you'd need an RTX 2080 to run it at the recommended settings</a>! The gall! And here we are, almost three months later, with word that the game has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Not only has it been delayed, but it's been delayed indefinitely. Yesterday, developer Aspyr shared a statement on Bitter announcing the delay, writing that they've "listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Further than that, anyone that's preordered the game will receive a full refund. The statement doesn't provide any details other than that, nor when Aspyr expect to share any other details about the remaster. 
</p>
<p>
If you were someone desperate to jump back into a slightly flashier version of Deus Ex (but as Mark noted at the time of the remaster's announcement, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">you can bag the OG for only £6</a>, so I'm not sure why you'd want such a thing), I'd keep your expectations in check for now. Such an overhaul will take quite a while.
</p><p>
It is worth noting that it's not just the graphics that got a new look. There are supposed quality-of-life improvements like autosaves, faster loading, controller support, little things we take for granted now essentially. When the time comes, it might be a nice new way to play the game, but for now, put it at the back of your mind.

<p>All right, I've definitely got a weakness for Star Wars games which shift the camera away from all the glowy sword fights and space politics, instead zooming in on galactic ne'er-do-wells getting up to mischief. I blame my dad's influence. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> stuck that chord for me, and Star Wars: Galactic Racer looks like it'll combine similar appeal with the trump card of chaotic off-road racing.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">last night's Geoffs</a>, Galactic Racer's a speeder speedfest from Fuse Games - a new studio led by ex-Criterion devs with Burnout and Need For Speedy flavour to their CVs. Though, watching its trailer and reading through <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-trailer?image_id=star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-01_d7c67bb8">an interview</a> Fuse co-founder Matt Webster and Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly have given to the official Star Wars website, my brain's been taken to a different racing place.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off packs of landspeeders and speederbikes swooping and slamming as they hover through trails that wind through the likes of a ship graveyard on desert world Jakku and the snowy wilds of Ando Prime. It's obviously leaning into the podracing vibes we've seen videogamed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</a>, even starring Phantom Menace speedster Sebulba, but in practice, the action sounds like Evolution Studios' old PlayStation mud-fests.</p><p>"We’ve drawn real inspiration from runs-based games so the player will have meaningful, consequential decisions to be making on how they chose their path to become an elite racing pilot — from the vehicle they choose to start with, the upgrade choices they make to create a build that really suits their playstyle and what events they select in determining their path to become champion of the League," Webster said in the interview. "Along the way you’ll compete with rivals, journey to new planets, and master different classes of repulsor craft — or speeders — each with their own distinct capabilities.</p>
<p>"We have a range of racing repulsorcraft for players to discover in the game, each of which have unique handling characteristics to master. Speederbikes, for example, are fast and ferocious, you’ll be braking heavily into corners, really leaning in and then massive drops of acceleration as you power your way through the exit. Also notice that in many of our events, our different speeder classes race at the same time, with exciting physical interactions as those differing racing lines come together."</p>
<p>Given the off-roady courses, that last bit about routes aimed at the different strengths of different craft  diverging and coming back together is the aspect that's put my mind back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>. Obviously, it's not like Galactic Racer's floaty rides will be getting stuck in the mud or splattering through it with chunky tyres, but cutting through narrow chasms in your nimble skim speeder to avoid being side-swiped by a bulkier landspeeder on a more open track definitely is.</p>
<p>All in all, the prospect of battling through the underground racing scene as Shade - "a lone racer with a dream of glory and revenge" - has definitely got my engine running at this point.</p>
<p>If the same applies to you, Star Wars: Galactic Racer's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">Steam</a>.</p>

The future is here! Or, I guess it's around 40,000 years away, but that's still more or less here for the Total War series, which'll be tackling a futuristic setting for the first time in last night's reveal of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Warhammer 40,000 spin-off reveal</a>. It's got most of what you'd expect, like those mean ole Space Marines, and big, dramatic, explosive battles with so much going on on screen you'll get a hernia. But there were a few details shared in a post-reveal blog post that go into some small bits that weren't a part of the big reveal.
</p>
<p>
Right at the bottom of said <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/total-war-warhammer-40000">blog post</a> is an FAQ, with the first notable question there being "where are the Chaos Space Marines?" As it stands, the only revealed factions so far are the regular Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum. In response to that question, Creative Assembly explained that the Chaos Space Marines won't be there at launch, but they'll "absolutely" be a part of their plans "at some point, along with all the other iconic factions from the setting."
</p>
<p>
Then there's the question of modding. From right off the bat, the team wants to support modding on the Steam Workshop from launch, but it's the official modding tools you'll have to wait a while longer for. This is down to Creative Assembly's new Warcore engine, and they note that they'll have more details to share on that "close to launch." Oh, and don't worry, there won't be any blood DLC because the "41st Millennium is a setting of eternal war, so blood and dismemberment is key to creating an authentic experience."
</p>
<p>
The blog post also makes mention of a "small roundtable with members of the development team" coming next week on December 16th. Important to note that you shouldn't expect a big look at gameplay, it sounds like more of a light chat about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. A full look at its story and gameplay will apparently come in spring, so hang tight for now.
