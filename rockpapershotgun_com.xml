            <p>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it's controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 
</p>
<p>Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">via Steam</a>, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're unfamiliar, Taiko no Tatsujin games are rhythm games about hitting a drum (on the top or on the side) in time to a beat, as colour-coded notes flow onto the screen from right to left. They're also terrifically bright and silly, your efforts cheered on by a drum mascot called Don Chan. Their songlists skew extremely Japanese, too, featuring a mixture of J-pop, vocaloid music, and anime soundtracks.
</p>
<p>The previous game in the series, Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master, came to PC but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/taiko-no-tatsujin-the-drum-master-is-out-on-pc-with-studio-ghibli-dlc">only via Game Pass and the Windows store for some reason</a>. Rhythm Festival is the first to arrive on Steam.
</p>
<p>It features the usual mixture of modes, practice sessions, online multiplayer, and several difficulty levels. If you're hungry for more than the songs included in the base game, you can expand your selection with the Taiko Music Pass for a monthly fee, or buy tracks via DLC packs. You can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=UFFa0QoHWvE&amp;ab_channel=Seatbelts-Topic">Tank! from Cowboy Bebop</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885010/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival__Anime_Pack_Vol_2/">Anime Pack Vol. 2</a>, for example. Everyone listen to Tank! now.
</p>
<p>If you're tempted, it's worth giving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">the demo a whirl on Steam</a> first to see whether the difficulty, setlist, and somewhat grindy structure appeal to you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> is making changes in an attempt to keep younger players safe in the online platform. Beginning later this month, children under the age of 13 will no longer be able to search, discover or play unrated experiences within Roblox, and will be unable to access social hangout experiences.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Parents and young users need accurate information about the experiences they are playing. Moving forward, all creators must complete a questionnaire for each experience they want available for users under 13. This means that all unrated experiences will be filtered out of search and any public or recommended sorts for users under 13," says <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>Creators have until December 3rd to fill out the questionnaire if they want their content rated for play for those under the of 13. After that point, the unrated content will be filtered out.
</p>
<p>The changes to social hangouts will take effect earlier, on November 18th.
</p>
<p>"We are also updating our policies to address user behavior that can potentially pose a risk to our youngest users," says the post, desperately trying to avoid using words like 'pedophiles' or 'predators'. "Starting November 18, experiences with certain types of interactive features, specifically social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation, will only be playable to users over the age of 13. Creators will always be able to play their own experience or any experience they have edit access to."
</p><p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">report by Bloomberg</a> addressed the scale of child safety issues within Roblox, highlighting 13,316 instances of child exploitation reported on the platform in 2023. The following month, Hindenberg Research - an organisation which reports on businesses in order to profit from short-selling - published its own report <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">labelling Roblox a "pedophile hellscape"</a>. Roblox responded to claims in both reports, saying Bloomberg's coverage featured "glaring mischaracterisations" and that it "rejects" Hindenberg's report.
</p>
<p>It's arguably worth putting that number in context, since Roblox is vastly successful with 78 million daily active users as of earlier this year. It's also worth noting that if you perfectly set the parental controls and dodge the predators, the reward is that your kid gets to safely play some of the worst, most exploitatively-designed video games imaginable. You think the skinner box design, FOMO and gambling tactics are bad in mainstream free-to-play games? Wait until you see what they're like when they're created by companies with no public reputation or licensors to protect.
</p>
<p>My kid's school recently sent home a leaflet about Roblox, explaining what it is and how parents can keep children safe in it. Part of the leaflet explained the concept of "ODers", which apparently stands for "Online Daters", who in this context are adults who use Roblox to find an adult romantic partner. I looked it up and this is apparently a real thing and I've been spiralling ever since. I always thought I'd be the sort of person to keep up with technological and social trends, but I'm sloping into middle age and realising that no, I can't, I won't. They've changed what 'it' is and now what's 'it' seems weird and scary to me. 
</p>
<p>I tell every parent I meet what I'll tell you: under 13 or over 13, safe or not safe, don't let your kids play Roblox. Teach them to have taste.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>You've got until December 6th to buy them</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega are delisting several bundles of 'classic' games from digital stores, along with "select individual" games. On Steam specifically, this adds up to over 60 games in total, including several actual classics including the original Streets Of Rage trilogy, Crazy Taxi, and Jet Set Radio. 
</p>
<p>The games will be removed on December 6th but will remain playable to those who already own them.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We've got some news to share regarding our Classics bundles. As of December 6th, 2024 we'll be saying farewell to new purchases of the SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics &amp; Dreamcast Classics. Both of these great bundles and select individual games will be delisted on Steam December 6th," says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/205950/announcements/detail/4483990132492337189">the announcement</a>, which seems to rather undersell the number of games being delisted.
</p>
<p>"No worries if you already own a game or bundle. These gems will still live in your Steam library. You can download and play SEGA Classics games whenever you want, as long as you own them before December 6th."
</p>
<p>The full list of games being delisted on Steam is <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBCN80ZHHPAEQYX1C1M3M9">listed on a Sega support FAQ</a>, but I'll include it below:

</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sega offer no reason for why the games are being removed from sale, but typically delisting happens for one of three reasons: expiring licenses; new exclusivity to a different storefront; or an intent to re-release the games in a new form (eg. an enhanced edition, typically with a higher price).
</p><p>This time last year, Sega announced their intent to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-announce-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-streets-of-rage-golden-axe-and-shinobi">new games based on Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Streets Of Rage, Golden Axe and Shinobi</a>, and previously signalled their intent to produce <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-plan-more-remakes-and-remasters-but-still-aiming-to-create-revolutionary-super-game">more remakes and remasters</a> of their classic games.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt: delisting is bad and I hate it. Even if these games are to return in an improved format, and even if that new format is universally beloved by all, I still wish the existing versions weren't sent to the attic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
