            <p>Peter Akemann - co-founder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a>'s Treyarch and recent president of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">Eurogamer</a>. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.</p>
<p>The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf">agreed to plead</a> guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property,” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph T. McNally in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/culver-city-man-agrees-plead-guilty-recklessly-crashing-drone-super-scooper">statement</a>. “This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders.”</p>
<p>Here's how the statement describes the incident:</p>
<blockquote><p>Akemann flew the drone at least 2,500 meters (more than 1.5 miles) toward the fire and lost sight of the drone. As Akemann was flying the drone, it collided with a Government of Quebec Super Scooper carrying two crewmembers attempting to fight the blaze. The impact caused an approximately 3-inch-by-6-inch hole in the left wing. After landing, maintenance personnel identified the damage and took the aircraft out of service for repairs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Akemann's defense attorneys say he is "deeply sorry" for the incident in a separate statement, although bring up "a number of mitigating factors," write Eurogamer, "including the supposed failure of a geo fencing safeguard feature on Akemann’s DJI Drone".</p>
<p>Humble Bundle (who are owned by RPS parent company Ziff Davis) are currently offering a <a href="https://promo.humblebundle.com/lafirerelief">collection of bundles</a> to support those affected by the LA Fires. Call Of Duty Publisher Activision recently donated $1M to LA fire relief, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/call-of-duty-introduces-a-new-operator-bundle-to-raise-funds-for-fire-relief-in-la">along with proceeds</a> from the 'LA Fire Relief Ultra' skin for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone. Necrosoft's Brandon Sheffield has recently been putting together an <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io bundle</a> to help those affected with direct financial assistance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace)<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forgotton-anne-devs-reveal-a-new-metroidvania-starring-a-horrifying-face-torso"> covered the announcement</a> for Forgotlings back in 2023. It's a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotton-anne">Forgotton Anne</a> - one of my favourites from 2018. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotlings">Forgotlings</a>, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Steam demo</a>. This is such good news I've basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.</p>

<p>You play as Fig, a mannequin with a face on his torso, which could be deeply off-putting in basically any other art style but ThroughLine's Ghibliness. It's still a little off-putting, honestly. The premise behind the setting is that forgotten objects - Forgotlings - wake up here as sentient creatures. Hopping wardrobes, talking TVs, and the like. As Fig, you start the demo searching for your friend Silvia in a mountain. This is obviously a tricky place to search. Lots of elevation. Could be anywhere.</p>
<p>While Forgotton Anne was basically a puzzle game with some platform elements, this one is far more of an action platformer. You'll scramble up ledges, wall jump, and slowly drag yourself up steep hills. There are still navigation puzzle elements - block pushing and the like - so I'm interested to see if ThroughLine keep up their previous's level of complexity in tandem with the combat. Forgotten Anne wasn't <em>too</em> much of a head-scratcher, mind - much more about getting to know the world than hitting it with things.</p><p>As for combat, it seems <em>fine</em> so far. You've got a nifty backstep and a block, as well as options to sneak around a bit before diving in. Still, the main draw for me here is another chance to dip into the world ThroughLine have built. I can find such overt Ghibli influence cloying sometimes, but there's enough character and charm elsewhere that the setting really does come alive as its own thing. No release date on this one yet, but I'll try to <em>remember</em> to keep you updated. <em>The name's Reuben</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers Of The Eyeless </a>any time soon. I follow the game's creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VenrisSFO">Venris on YouTube</a>. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a> overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-warhammer-2/sfo-grimhammer-2-venris">he mods for</a> around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">Steam early access</a>. Edwin described it as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-morta">Children Of Morta</a> are also influences, as is folklore from Venris's native Poland. As you can likely glean from the deliciously overwrought trailer narration, this one's about gradually powering up your cult until you've shed the remains of your humanity, and then using that newfound power for wholesome activities like bending a crumbling city to the will of various horrible deities. Like Darkest Dungeon, things like the sanity and the health of your characters have a lasting impact from fight to fight.</p>
<p>You'll need to keep an eye on cult management by inspiring "fervor" among your cultists "or risk betrayal as doubts creep through the ranks". There's subterfuge too, as you "send disciples to weaken rivals, gather resources, and spread your influence". It looks dense, which isn't too surprising considering that Venris and the team's work on SFO has been based around adding even more complexity to an already silly complex game.</p><p>Whispers Of The Eyeless's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2523890/view/545599869129065070">next major patch</a> is set to arrive later today, with various balancing tweaks based on player feedback. A short campaign seems to be one of the major player bugbears at the moment, which the developers say is one of their chief concerns for the short term. Now, I just need the modder who made these beautiful <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3383603230&amp;searchtext=">Brain Froud-ian gnoblars</a> to make a full creature collecting game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'm just so tired, man. Is this a dare? Because I'm basically taking the bait just by writing about it, aren't I? "The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."</p>
<p>This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsugragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.</p>
<p>As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am willing to accept that this a very strong carrier bag. The brief amount of research I've done shows that Dyneema is indeed expensive, and also stronger than Kevlar. I have no doubt that, when it comes to the act of carrying things inside of it, this bag may be in some sense 'worth the money'.</p><p>But is it worth your soul, ZA/UM? Stupid question. Nothing attached to this game has escaped its curse. There was some brief hubbub over the weekend over a false rumour that creator Robert Kurvitz uploaded Disco Elysium to the Internet Archive. The actual upload had been around since 2023. It's <a href="https://archive.org/details/disco-elysium-ultra-compressed.-7z">now no longer available</a>, presumably as a result of this new wave of attention. Meanwhile, writer Argo Tuulik is currently running a crowdfunding campaign for legal fees for himself and fellow write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">Dora Klindžić</a> in a fight to get back the Disco IP. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">three Disco Elysium 'spiritual successors' currently in the works</a>. In any timeline but this, that should be cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Me? I'm just staring at this fucking carrier bag. Trying times, soulwise. I can't even think of anything sage or witty to say about it. It feels like even gesturing at the irony is itself such a self-defeating rabbit hole of cliches that I sigh loudly before I've even finished the sentence. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mVscQYjuq_s">just that Zoolander</a> bit again. Be kind to each other. Leave tips. Not for Atelier though. Fuck those guys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-devour">Roots Devour</a> - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Roots Devour is a vegetal horror cardgame in which you, a monstrous sapling grown from the mind-flaying manure of the Lovecraft mythos, spread your tendrils through a forest, harvesting fluids from its creatures and working your way up the food chain until you are top Tam-ash, Oakranos or [insert superior Lovecraft tree pun here]. To do this, you click-drag roots between cards. The basic constraints are, firstly, that you need a clear line of sight between cards, so you’ll need to expand around obstacles such as dense rival root networks, and secondly, that you need blood to grow, and each unfortunate lifeform you snare only has so much to share. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, the poor critters split under your embrace, forming fussy piles of limbs that must be scooped up individually. So inconsiderate. When they’re drained of blood, they continue to serve you as nodes in your root network, dangling like hairy dried fruits from your boughs. Roots Devour’s presentation is perfectly icky, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a> but with deep gushing notes of Bram Stoker. It’s also localised from Chinese, so even if you're hip to cosmic monsters, you might have a bit of trouble figuring out the tutorial and lore text.
</p>
<p>
As you expand, you’ll amplify your capacities with card packs that award various boons. A card that harbours digestive fluids, for example, will allow you to seize and pacify a larger beast such as a deer. A card that harbours a source of florescence will let you see cards from further off. Some of these card packs are awarded by a mysterious human-looking ally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flora">Flora</a>, who appears immune to your predations, and is capable of sucking vitality from you in turn. Between stages, you can also retreat to your sylvan heart of hearts and expend biomatter to level up.
</p><p>
Roots Devour did not help me sleep, but it did make me feel less unnerved about that mildly eldritch building across from my hotel. I’m watching it now. I wrote "insistently symmetrical" before, but now that I look closely, none of the windows appear to be the same shape. Still, at least it’s not, e.g., an absolute king-hell shitlord of a tree. The full version of Roots Devour launches this year, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more on Steam</a>.
