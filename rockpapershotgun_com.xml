            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails naval expansion had its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">release pushed back</a> from June 17th to November 26th. You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marauding-medieval-masses-mash-together-beneath-the-mainsail-in-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails">give it a go</a> right now if you fancy, so it obviously made that second date. Prior to the DLC dropping, I chatted with Bannerlord senior producer Falk Engel about what went into the decision to ditch the initial summer date, and why custom naval battles were <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">only confirmed</a> to be arriving with its launch quite late in the day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked whether the delay was down to specific issues which needed to be overcome, or just a general desire to spend more time polishing the massive overhaul up, Engel told me it was a "bit of both". There's always this technical challenge to optimise it as much as possible," he said. "Especially as you add more content and features, because everything that you add can also break stuff that you thought was already done with.</p>
<p>"Then on the other hand, there was a conscious conversation, conscious discussion that the title was not yet at the level of quality and the amount of content and features that we wanted. So, it was just the sensible choice for us to take additional time and that time as well allowed us to push out the base game changes for player feedback and react to that player feedback."</p>
<p>So, Taleworlds spent time refining War Sails and patch v1.3.4, as well as answering questions from players in regular developer blog posts to keep interest in the DLC boiling away. In the <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">fourth of these posts</a>, the team answered a question about whether War Sails would include custom naval battles - standalone fights players can set up to their liking from the main menu in the base game - at launch. Surprise: the post revealed, following previous feedback, that those custom ship battles would be coming at launch.</p><p>When I asked Engel what went into the original decision not to have these custom naval battles right away, and how those plans changed, he conceded that it's a "bit more of a technical question", so he'd need to go out on a limb. "The way that I understand it, our custom battle is a separate module from sandbox, from campaign, etc," he explained. "With the way that we've set up our base game, it can function like that. The way that the DLC is set up, the ships and so forth are set up, it’s more complex to access the relevant elements of the game. One of the things that I believe we still don't have in naval custom battles, for example, are the [ship] figureheads. That is because of this sort of modular or module approach to different elements of the game."</p>
<p>He added that, natually, this modular approach is a boon for modding, revealing that "essentially, War Sails is a large mod". While he didn't get into specifics, Engel did add that developing War Sails has "resulted in changes to the way that modding is supported", which have had a "positive impact" overall.</p>
<p>As someone who's always a bit more comfortable watching an assault I know won't leave me having to lick my wounds and start rebuilding my army from scratch after a few painful nights in chains, I'm certainly glad Taleworlds were able to make custom battles work from the get-go. Plus, they're an ideal way of trying the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-designer-on-ships-that-mimic-horse-archers-and-dredging-for-inspiration-in-french-bogs">fleet of historically-inspired vessels</a> before you commit to investing the considerable coin to buy one in a full campaign.</p>

            <p>Original TimeSplitters and GoldenEye developers David Doak and Steve Ellis have reunited to make - oh, those scalliwags, you're going to love this - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> word puzzler called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-words">Beyond Words</a>, which is being billed as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> meets Scrabble".</p>
<p>That quote is actually from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/balatro-and-scrabble-just-had-a-baby-thanks-to-two-of-the-legends-behind-goldeneye-and-timesplitters">Time Extension</a>, but publishers PQube have reprinted it ecstatically in the announcement release, and well, come on, look at it. Watch the trailer below. If this game wasn't inspired by Balatro, I will eat an actual Scrabble board, mossy green bags and all. Then I will shit a match-winning seven-letter word of mild approval, like "quality". I do like Scrabble, even when it has 300+ modifiers in it and some possibly AI-generated polar bears.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">a demo for Beyond Words on Steam</a>. If you click through and play that demo, I will not have to explain the game any further, and can save my precious high-scoring words for other breaking news stories, like whatever the hell Tim Sweeney has said now. But no, I see that you are still reading, because you are too much in thrall to words. Friend, I can only salute your lexophilia. Here is another paragraph, specially for you.</p><p>As in Scrabble, the goal in Beyond Words is to form your hand of letter tiles into high-scoring words. But this ain't the traditional Scrabble layout, with those wily triple-word bonus squares in the far corners. There's a selection of boards, aka "living puzzles". Some of them look like Zelda dungeons after a pinch of nose candy, sprinkled with gold coins and barricades and power-up signs.</p>
<p>This isn't the traditional Scrabble scoring system, either: you can change letter scores, duplicate them and destroy them. You can "bend the rules past breaking point with modifiers, stickers, and enhancements where every choice shapes your journey". There are also time attack challenges, boss battles, seeded runs and "the brain-melting flipside of negative scoring". If you play the demo, please get back to us to confirm whether your brain has melted - I'm quite attached to my brain and would rather not risk it.</p>
<p>Beyond Words is due in early access in early 2026. The Steam page carries the disclosure that "generative AI was one of many tools used by professional artists to assist in the creation of the artwork for the game". I have to write up Sweeney's latest next so I'll save today's torch-waving excoriations about generative AI usage for that post.</p>
<p>The court dutifully acknowledges that this is not the first time somebody's spilled Balatro over Scrabble - there's also <a href="https://playletterlike.com/">Letterlike</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3586660/Word_Play/">Word Play</a>, at the very least. If you'd rather play some kind of first-person shooter with N64 or PS2 graphics, maybe check out loving fangame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-rewind-the-fanmade-sort-of-remake-project-finally-makes-it-into-early-access-13-years-on">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a>.</p>

            <p>You! Stop trying to break in! Also, while you're at it, stop using quick use item swapping to shoot me faster than you'd otherwise be able to! All of that is yelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-latest-update-nerfs-an-overperforming-pistol-rebalances-boom-damage-and-also-has-ducks">patch</a>, which sees devs Embark go after a number of pesky exploits and also make piggybacks much less effective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">Update 1.4.0</a>'s notes, a gun exploit which allows shotgunners to rapid fire faster than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back again to skip a reload animation is no more. Dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GFw3n2StWfA">double pumping</a>, the exploit was typically used when wielding Il Toro, which is of course a pump-action lead-slinger. Anyway, it's gone now. You can almost hear that one Call of Duty character who used to yell that switching guns is always faster than reloading shedding a single tear of joy, as the impetus to carry around 20 shotguns returns to Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Embark are sick of folks getting into places they shouldn't be. Hence some burglar-proofing "exploit mitigation mechanisms" being added to every locked room on every map. All of 'em. Exterior access to the locked room in the Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has also been blocked off, so good luck getting in there now.</p>
<p>Rounding out the patch, embark have nixed some lighting glitches, rectified some low-res main menu textures, and made sure restarting the game won't mess up any voices. Oh, and you now can't push other players around by jumping on their backs. Given how key backpacks are to raider fashion, this probably isn't the game to be try to get a surprise ride on your mate in. Even if you're only trying to shift them out of the way of a door. They might have a bad back, and that's probably making their life in robo-ruled future Italy tough enough without your antics.</p>
