            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-brings-baby-dinosaurs-with-it-this-october">Recently announced</a> dino management sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> already has some system requirements, well in advance of its October 21st release. You can give them a peep on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>, where they’re revealed as a refreshingly light list of relatively attainable cards 'n' chips, with a mere 25GB storage requirement – a welcome bucking of recent trends for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">100GB-plus</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-hope-youve-got-a-spare-190gb-kicking-about-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">SSD installations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">extravagant GPU demands</a>.</p>
<p>In less encouraging news, the same Steam page also includes one detail that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/summer-game-fest-2025">Summer Game Fest</a> trailer didn’t mention: Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes use of generative AI, specifically to create "Scientists' avatars" among your park staff.</p>

<p>That disclosure is, at least, more detailed and specific <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">than some games bother with</a>. And we don’t yet know how often or even in what context we’ll see these machine-hewn boffins – if they’re just dinky models wandering around the raptor paddocks, specks of white in your god’s-eye view, you might not even notice their soulless, artless visages. Still, it remains easy to forget about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-a-best-case-scenario-future-generative-ai-must-put-creators-at-its-heart">more optimistic arguments</a> for AI generation when the real-life examples we’ve seen so far tend towards the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-devs-multiplayer-shooter-the-finals-is-full-of-ai-voices-and-oof-you-can-tell">robotic</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-strongly-feel-this-ai-powered-demo-of-quake-2-is-an-insult-to-life-itself">terrible</a>. You could say Evolution 3’s approach will prevent asset recycling, but I personally wouldn’t worry about a repeating scientist face breaking the immersion of my cloned dinosaur theme park.</p>
<p>Anyway, system requirements. Again, these look very accessible by 2025 standards: even the recommended graphics card list is a mix of mid-range oldies and newer budget models, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-b580-review">Intel Arc B580</a>. And again, 25GB isn’t much to make room for these days either – that’s less than half the storage heft of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>. Here’s the full specs list, for those who prefer scrolling to clicking:</p>

<p>The game itself promises an upgraded, more modular suite of building and terraforming tools, as well as lil’ baby dinos you’ll be able to nuture into profitably terrifying adulthood. It also features the vocal talents of film series star Jeff Goldblum, which unfortunately makes me<em> less</em> interested, as – and this is not necessarily the fault of Mr. Goldblum himself – I cannot mental unshackle him from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thirty-flights-of-loving">Thirty Flights of Loving</a> mode that replaces every character with his mumbling, stuttering likeness:</p>

Well well well, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake developers Bloober Team are working on a remake of the very first Silent Hill in collaboration with publishers Konami. Please give me a few seconds to pat myself furiously on the back for asking Bloober about the prospects of an original Silent Hill remake, way back in August last year. Oracular insight, thy name is Edwin. OK, that's enough patting, my shoulders are starting to hurt. You can watch the teaser trailer now, which surfaced during Konami's Press Start showcase today. Lovely to hear that gut-twisting banjo melody again.

There's zip to say beyond what you see in that video - no Silent Hill remake release date, no hint about how the story or combat system might change. The game is only confirmed as being "in development". We can, of course, make deductions from Bloober's past efforts. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, Brendy called it "a handsome horror remake that plays safe with its own history". I had a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">thinky thoughts</a> myself about the formal ironies of remaking a game defined by repressed trauma.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of playing things safe, it seems likely that Bloober weren't being entirely straight with me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">when I asked them why they didn't start by remaking the first game</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
"I think Silent Hill 2 just matches our DNA way better," Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart told me at the time. "It's much more emotional, a much more personal story than, for example, the first game or the third game. And we at Bloober were always fans of telling personal stories about people's experiences, people's feelings and how they go through them. Not so much about, you know know, occultism and things from other worlds, right? So I think that was the main reason, basically." 
</p>
<p>
Lead producer Maciej Głomb qualified, however, that "it's not like we were making this decision, right? The franchise is connected to Konami's plans."
</p>
<p>
If all this strikes you as one throwback too many, you might be better served by the forthcoming Japan-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and indeed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the spin-off from Observation developers No Code, of which little has been heard for some time.
