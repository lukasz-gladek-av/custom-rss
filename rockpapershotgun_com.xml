<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has a new patch that makes a raft of changes to the Paradox city builder's UI and systems such as traffic and garbage, while adding two new Easy and Normal difficulty modes and ten 'birthday parks' to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-celebrate-10-years-of-cities-skylines-with-a-roadmap-of-anniversary-goodies">celebrate the first game's 10 year anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The developers have also made some "quality-of-life improvements related to homelessness". That's "quality-of-life" in the vacuum-sealed software development sense of the simulation being nicer to operate, rather than quality of life in the sense of having a roof over your head. I would probably have gone with some slightly less dystopian phrasing, Colossal Order.</p><!--more-->
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 patch 1.2.5f1 adds a homelessness stat to the population info view, and makes homeless 'households' visible and selectable in park Selected Info Panels. "These changes make it easier to track homelessness, find homeless populations in your city, and check the situation for individual homeless citizens," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/604150552688854681?l=english">changelog</a> explains.</p>
<p>They've also tinkered with the game's systems to reduce homelessness in general. As of this new patch, "if the homeless in your city are generally employed, they simply need affordable housing," the changelog continues. "If they are also unemployed, they will need jobs suitable for their education level before they can leave the homeless status behind."</p>
<p>Colossal Order have also changed the logic for newly adult citizens leaving their childhood homes. Rather than leaving as soon as they reached adulthood, and becoming homeless if there were no affordable new homes to be had, they'll stay until certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Firstly, they'll need a job before moving out. Secondly, households will provide kids flying the roost with some starting funds for a new house: if there isn't enough cash to spare, the younger generation will stick around and contribute their incomes to the household. Thirdly, they'll now check for available homes before moving out. If there aren't any to be had, they'll leave the city and become commuters. That's to say, their housing needs will become another city's problem.</p>
<p>Going by the most recent Steam reviews, the big story with Skylines 2 is still the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">technical state at launch</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">shortage of features</a> versus its much-updated predecessor, but there have also been some headline-worthy twiddles for the economic and social systems. Last June, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-achieves-ultimate-catharsis-by-deleting-landlords-to-fix-spiralling-rent-prices-in-its-next-patch">solved the problem of soaring rents by deleting landlords</a>, a crowd-pleasing "quality-of-life" adjustment if ever there was one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like no matter where you go, Mappa is right there, ready and waiting with an anime something-or-other you weren't expecting. This time, you'll find the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, of all places, specifically in its first expansion pack Lost Colony. Studio Wildcard revealed a teaser of the expansion yesterday, set to be released November this year, showing off one of "numerous" anime cutscenes that it will feature focusing on the character Mei Yin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you couldn't recognise her voice from all the grunting she does in the trailer, Michelle Yeoh is reprising her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated series, and she'll be joined by Madeleine Madden as Helena Walker from the show too. The expansion will also include Moana's Auli'i Cravalho as Meeka, that little kid hanging out with Vin Diesel in Ark 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-stars-vin-diesel">reveal trailer</a>. And yes, Wildcard wants you to know that her presence alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a>, Genesis, and Lost Colony "leads into the events" of the sequel. Wildcard has been pretty quiet on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> since its announcement in 2020 outside of a few delays, so this at least marks some sign of life.

<p>
Lost Colony will feature the kind of additions many expansions do like new abilities, gear, building systems, things like that. Story wise you're being hunted by, uh, demons, it seems, which there appeared to be a taste of in the teaser above, in a "vast occupied city" called Arat Prime, the "birthplace of the Arks."
</p>
<p>
Ark 2 itself has been delayed numerous times, and was technically meant to come out last year, but considering Wildcard released a <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-440-ark-survival-ascended-content-roadmap-r2429/">content roadmap</a> earlier this year that featured plans for Survival Ascended all the way up to December 2026, and nothing for its sequel, you're probably safe to place a bet on it taking a while longer.
