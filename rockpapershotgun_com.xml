            <p>
LinkedIn today is a terrible den of web3+ grifters, obsolete CVs, frog-boiling pressure to buy a subscription, and scurrilous journalists hunting for leaks in job listings. But every now and then it comes good. For example, there’s a discussion underway between various senior developers, including current and former staff of Remedy, Ubisoft and Naughty Dog, about the causes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/crunch">crunch</a>, aka ruinous overwork. 
</p>
<p>
There’s a pervading atmosphere of former triple-A blokes warming up their soapboxes for a GDC talk down the line, and a certain amount of insider jargon about “pipelines” and so forth – somebody should probably do a piece on the etymology of “pipelines” in software development. But it’s otherwise a useful chat. There is minimal indulgence of the old saw about crunch being unavoidable because ‘passionate’ creative people are inherently prone to burning themselves out. The emphasis is on crunch as a structural phenomenon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The chinwag’s instigator is Novaquark technical director John Walther, a former senior technical artist at Ubisoft, where he worked on the Anvil engine used by Assassin’s Creed and Ghost Recon. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnw91_the-big-reason-its-so-important-for-every-activity-7414836160482553856-0yqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">kicks off with the hopeful assertion</a> that “the big reason it's so important for every studio to improve their pipelines and processes right now is because of the industry trending away from crunch.” Walther continues that “crunch has been used to make some of the biggest blockbuster AAAs but it's not sustainable as it burns out dev teams” and as such, has been “universally rejected across the games industry.”
</p>
<p>
Less positively, he feels that “many companies are turning back to crunch as it's the only way they know to find success”, with “pressure coming from publishers tightening their grip”. This may “work in the short term but the long term solution is improving pipelines and processes”. Walther argues that “scoping down” is “the easy and boring solution” to this. “I think we should continue to make ambitious games, we just need to work in a more efficient and organized manner.” I’m not sure I recognise the implied link between “ambition” and sheer production scale here, but I appreciate the sentiment.
</p><p>
People responding to the post include Robert Krekel, former audio director at Naughty Dog, who is now audio director at Atomic Arcade. “While crunch is often blamed on poor production, over-scoping, or broken processes which all absolutely contribute, there’s another factor that doesn’t get discussed nearly enough: ego,” he argues. “When you put a large number of high performers on the same team, there’s often an unspoken pressure to define what the 'industry standard' is in your specific discipline not because it’s required to ship the product, but because individuals want to be seen as the best at what they do by their peers. It’s an uncomfortable reality at studios like Naughty Dog. The studio attracts people with that mindset by design.”
</p>
<p>
As such, Krekel thinks studio managers need to both fix “broken processes” and “give people the autonomy to push boundaries, exercise real agency, and feel genuine pride in their work, while also putting guardrails in place to protect them from themselves.”</p>
<p>Going by his comments, I would suggest that Naughty Dog especially still need to undergo some more general reflection about whether they want to cultivate this behaviour from the point of recruitment onward. This is assuming a fair bit of good faith on the part of bosses and parent company Sony, of course. Naughty Dog have long had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">reputation</a> for crunch culture - they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crunch-returns-to-naughty-dog-for-xmas-as-intergalactic-devs-work-overtime-on-a-demo-for-sony-claims-report">made headlines recently</a> for requiring developers to work longer hours on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet in the run-up to Xmas.
</p>
<p>
Josh DiCarlo – former Insomniac Games principal character technical director, and current creative technology director of Persona AI – feels that “crunch is not a SCOPE problem, it's - at its core - an institutional problem and it's almost entirely avoidable.” He begins by comparing his experiences of game development to his time in the film biz, commenting that “I've worked on films from beginning to end that had virtually no overtime - I have never heard of a modern AAA title that didn't have a soul crushing crunch period.”
</p><p>
“The problem is that solving crunch requires more than a verbal commitment from the studio to avoid it,” DiCarlo argues. “It requires buy-in and investment at ALL levels. To develop streamlined, holistic, automated pipelines that tackle asset publishing, versioning, and review material without reliance on individual contributors to follow elaborate processes. To enforce regular standardized reviews to buyoff and approve assets. To meticulously track development in a project and asset-centric way rather than a ticket centric one - and to have a financial consequence (i.e. OVERTIME).”</p>
<p>Some more context: Insomniac have seen their share of crunch, but they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insomniacs-ted-price-games-studios-must-break-the-habit-of-brute-forcing-through-problems">caused a stir</a> back in 2021 for allegedly avoiding mandatory overwork during development of Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.
</p>
<p>
Remedy’s principal audio designer Ville Petteri Sorsa has the snappiest reply. “Crunch is the easiest workaround for failures in management and project planning,” he says. “It usually emerges as a response to financial pressure and deadlines that were never realistic to begin with.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve crunched myself for various employers. It has always been due to some combination of inadequate project structure, not enough resources to do work I'm proud of, and putting myself under unnecessary pressure to deliver quantifiable results.</p>
<p>My workplace experiences are very different from those of game developers labouring on just the one release for years, milestone to milestone, amid a changing industry. How about you? Any memories of crunch - or successfully avoiding crunch - to share? Some follow-up material: back in 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outsourcing-doesnt-solve-crunch">ran a video</a> about how even companies that avoid crunch may outsource it to studios overseas.

            <p>A group of modders who got multiplayer servers running for Rockstar's schoolyard mischief simulator Bully <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bully-online-sees-modders-have-another-go-at-schoolyard-multiplayer-mayhem-arrives-in-paid-early-access-this-year">late last year</a> have suddenly pulled all traces of their creation offline. The project's been shutdown about a month after release, and thus far its creators haven't offered an explanation as to why, beyond emphasising that this outcome wasn't what they hoped would happen.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Bully Online project is shutting down forever," reads an announcement which popped up on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1275210273481031752/1449940958794747985/1461027105054789814">Discord server</a> of project lead and YouTuber Swegta yesterday afternoon. "Which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours: our official Bully Online server (on swegta.com) will be shutdown, development of scripts for Bully Online will stop, the source code will be removed from swegta.com, all our webpages referring to it will be removed, the launcher downloads will taken down, and all Bully Online account data will be permanently deleted."</p>
<p>As you'll also be dutifully informed if you head over to <a href="https://swegta.com/">that website</a>, Swegta's set to make a statement about the shutdown on January 21st, with this looking set to come in YouTube video form. Outside of that, all the mod's team currently said regarding the reasoning behind the shutdown in that Discord post is this: "For now though, know this was not something we wanted." They added that Bully Online players had 24 hours from the announcement going live to hop on, take a final stroll in the mod, and backup any screenshots they want to keep.</p>
<p>While we'll have to wait and see if the YouTuber's full statement confirms as much, the whole thing smells very much like some Lionel Hutzes have been in touch and politely delivered a message amounting to 'please knock this off'. Rockstar and Take-Two have a lengthy history of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">dishing out such things</a> to modding projects, even if the company's general stance on modding has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-launch-official-roleplay-mods-store-where-you-can-spend-67-to-turn-gta-into-euro-truck-simulator-2">grown a bit more complex</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>If that is the case, it's sad to see a mod that sounded when I first heard about it back in November like it'd been in the works for a good while meeting such a rapid demise.</p>

            <p>There are two blue wolves inside you. One is actually a hedgehog, prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. The other one is actually a dolphin, who is also prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. Clarification: when I said you I meant me. I’m referring to my own squalid psychological architecture as a Sega Mega Drive player with vivid memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> (especially the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">Star Light Zone</a>) and Ecco the Dolphin. </p>
<p>While Sega’s pugnacious pinball mascot continues to star in videogames of all flavours, poor Ecco has been absent from screens since the early noughties. No longer: this year shall be the year of Ecco. Developers A&amp;R Atelier – whose members include the character’s original creator, Ed Annunziata – have <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/THE-WORLD-NEEDS-ECCO-THE-DOLPHIN">declared</a> that they are working on “several” new Ecco things, including a videogame. No, I won’t accommodate any criticism of my framing here. If we can have a year of Luigi and a year of Shadow, we can have a year of Ecco.</p><!--more-->
<p>New to Ecco? The original Mega Drive/Genesis games were 2D action-adventures in which you swam around beautiful pixel grottos, surfacing periodically for air and singing at other sea creatures and alien crystals. Wonderful, dreamy, frightening exercises in exploration and puzzling with a splash of ram-the-shark combat. The overarching storyline involves time travel and saving the planet. I have never played a swimming game with quite this ambience.</p>
<p>"It has been years in the making and we're honored to bring Ecco back," said Ed Annunziata, Chief Creative Officer of A&amp;R Atelier. "Ecco has always been more than a game about a dolphin - he's a bridge between worlds." Oh god, please let that be a reference to the aforesaid storyline and not a hint about some Netflix transmedia merchandising op. In general: please let A&amp;R Atelier not be some kind of shady cash-in operation. I've never heard of them before and they <a href="https://www.anratelier.com/">don't have a proper website</a>, at the time of writing.</p><p>We do already have some concrete indications of what those new Ecco projects are, concrete enough that the elusiveness of this week's announcement feels slightly weird. In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">an Xbox Wire post from May last year</a>, Annunziata revealed that "me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities." I also notice that the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">Ecco the Dolphin site</a> has a countdown on it, with approximately 2329 hours or 100 days to go.</p>
<p>While Ecco hasn’t attracted quite the same glut of fangames as Sonic, there are some <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/threads/ecco-the-dolphin-reverse-engineering-and-preservation-project.39893/">preservation projects</a> in the wilds, and <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=ecco+the+dolphin">a few Ecco homages on Itch.io</a>. Annunziata has himself hosted an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ecco-jam-0-tickets-1782288836889?aff=oddtdtcreator">Ecco gamejam</a>, though it was a private affair. If I were rebooting Ecco today, I would definitely be aiming to team up with some fangamers akin to the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>. Also, the new one had better not be 3D, you savages. We already have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> at home.</p>

            <p>You might be aware of the great Disco thrupening, or quadrupening depending on how you classify things. Over the past couple of years, a number of new studios have loudly hoovered up various ex-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> devs following internal conflict at ZA/UM, and announced games that aim to rebottle the RPG's lightning. One such studio is Londgue, who recently told me their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">partially-crowdfunded RPG</a> called Hopetown now has a playable intro, despite quietly switching narrative leads last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hopetown-disco-elysium-shadow-interview">interviewed two of Hopetown's key developers</a> in April last year, around the time Longdue launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown">Kickstarter campaign</a> to provide "a small percentage of the total budget" for the game. The campaign's since more than doubled its original £25,000 goal, amassing £117,924 from just over 2,700 backers. Development is now underway, but the narrative lead I interviewed, Grant Roberts, is no longer at Longdue. Roberts' <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantroberts/">LinkedIn profile</a> indicates he left the studio in July 2025, just three months after the Kickstarter's launch.</p>
<p>The former Rocksteady and Bungie writer's departure from a project his LinkedIn profile cites him as having "defined, refined, and evangelised the vision for" appears to have happened pretty quietly - so quietly that, as of writing, he's still listed in the team section of <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/">Hopetown's website</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair, former ZA/UM developer Martin Luiga was acknowledged as Hopetown's narrative lead in a <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/post/hopetown-developer-interview-martin-luiga">short developer update</a> posted by Longdue last August, though that update doesn't mention him having taken over from Roberts. I recently reached out to both Roberts and Longdue about this. The latter responded with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>We decided to part ways with Grant Roberts - who was narrative lead - after Martin Luiga (former co-founder of ZAUM and writer on Disco Elysium) scaled up his work with Longdue, and took over the role of narrative and creative lead after re-designing the skills system of the game.</blockquote>
<p>The studio also provided a quote from Luiga outlining how Hopetown's development is going as of January 2026. "We've re-designed and extensively tested a new skills system, based on my learnings from the early days of writing on Disco Elysium," the developer said. "We've also made incredible progress on the world, characters, and plot and have defined the opening scene of the game itself that is now in playable form, with variations of the introductory sequence written by myself and our writing team."</p><p>Longdue have been posting monthly short developer updates with different members of Hopetown's current team since that one with Luiga last August, so here's hoping on behalf of any folks who've backed the Kickstarter that a proper look at all of this apparent progress is released as part of those soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, original Disco studio ZA/UM continue to plow ahead with their own Disco follow-up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">Zero Parades</a>. Dark Math Games and Summer Eternal - two studios which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">IGN</a> reported in 2024 are or have been linked to each other and Longdue in various messy ways which occasionally beggar belief - are also working on their own Discoey things. For Dark Math, that's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">ski resort murder mystery game</a> called Tangerine Antarctic. For Summer Eternal, it's a mysterious game codenamed Red Rooster, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">announced by way of a book</a>. Finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are reportedly working on their own game at another studio named Red Info, and have remained relatively quiet compared to ZA/UM and the thruple of studios I've just mentioned thus far.</p>
<p>I personally remain rather sceptical of any of these shots to the Disco chaser, something which extends to ZA/UM's in-house attempt to re-ignite the magic following what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">certainly sounds like a horrible few years</a> to have been a dev on the original.</p>

            <p>We'll heave him up an away we'll go. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! We'll heave him up an away we'll go. We're all bound over to Ubisoft's official music YouTube channel! We'll heave him up from down below. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! Oh, this is where a bunch of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties have just been reuploaded, potentially providing yet another hint that we're all soon bound to be playing that long-rumoured remake of the pirassassin adventure!</p>
<p>This sudden influx of classic ditties might not have meant much in a vacuum, but it follows many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that's about as close as you can get to a seal of approval short of Ubisoft finally giving up the ghost anmd revealing the thing themselves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you fancy filling your brain with these pervasive earworms from the Age of Exploration once again, the fact 18 of them have been reuploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic">Ubisoft's music channel</a> within the past 24 hours makes doing so easy. These cuts of tunes ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vkoDWgLAQ">Way Me Susianah</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syW8yEW1HRE">Billy Riley</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xgr3Ne6hNk">We Be Three Poor Mariners</a> appear to be the same ones originally released in the sea shanty compilation album released around the time of Black Flag's original 2014 release.</p>
<p>Their appearance on this Ubisoft channel doesn't just appear to be part of a regular cycle of randomly reuploading older material either - the other recent soundtrack excerpts uploaded there have all been timed up to mirror the release of new stuff by the publishers. For example, a lot of the most recent tunes prior to this Black flag deluge are from December's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirages-allegedly-saudi-backed-dlc-valley-of-memory-releases-november-18">Valley of Memory expansion</a> from November.</p><p>So, while my personal favourite Black Flag sailing song The Worst Old Ship sadly isn't among these reuploaded shanties, they certainly look like another in the litany of Remake signs that even any vessels whose lookout desperately needs new spectacles have spotted by now.</p>
<p>Relatively recent reporting's alleged that said Remake, or Resync if the PEGI rathing has is name correct, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to arrive in March</a>. So, these tunes may be intended as something to help folks pass time while waiting out the last couple of months patrolling a deserted dock.</p>
