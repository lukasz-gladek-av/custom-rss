            <p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has become the latest game to have its initially listed recommended RAM requirement yanked down by a substantial amount, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">following in the footsteps</a> of fellow 2026 release 007: First Light.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers TT Games announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">Steam post</a> that the recommended RAM number for da bat's latest adventure now sits at 16GB rather than the initially announced 32GB.</p>
<p>"Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final," the studio added, citing this revision as being the product of some ongoing testing. "We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215200/LEGO_Batman_Legacy_of_the_Dark_Knight/">rest of the specs</a>, including an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB or Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16GB, remain as they were for now, An SSD is also still listed as a hard requirement in both the recommended and minimum specs.</p>
<p>The RAM revision comes amid what our hardware and occasional kitchenware guru James has dubbed RAMnarok. Basically, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM prices have gone through the roof</a> thanks to vast swaths of it being hoovered up for AI-related uses. So, those selling RAM for use in consumer PCs have had to jack up their prices to offset the beefier sums they're having to fork over to fill up their parts conveyor belts during this RAM shortage or simply to take advantage of the scarcity meaning you'll struggle to get ahold of some at a cheaper price elsewhere.</p><p>It's bad, especially when the knock-on effects for hardware like the recently delayed Steam Machine are taken into account. Hence games like Legacy of the Dark Knight dropping their RAM requirements where testing reveals they can, making them a more attractive proposition to folks who don't want to face the potential of paying through the nose for an upgrade to their existing rigs just to play. If RAM prices weren't soaring, such tweaks wouldn't be as big a deal, but they are, so here we are.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, all! It’s time once again to load the Maw up with new PC games, that we may stave off the apocalypse till next Monday. This week covers a wide spectrum of flavours and textures: papery, Dodo-ish, ducklike, inky, formaldehyde-y, pasty, furry, feculent, and fishy. Once you’re done throwing up, get back here and run your protesting eyes over the full list. As ever, we welcome your urgent suggestions.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720940/Book_Smugglers/">Book Smugglers</a> is a point and click adventure about circulating forbidden texts in 19th century Tsarist Lithuania.  </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362750/Stormbridge/">Stormbridge</a> is a strictly horizontal blend of tower defence and city builder in which you stretch out a settlement rightwards, while raising defences against an encroaching tempest on the left.</li>
<li>For people who want more randomisation and playdough faces in their Ogre Battling, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is a turn-based tactics affair in which characters roll dice each turn to determine the moves they can perform.</li>
<li>Out this day in early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720920/ASTROBOTANICA/">Astrobotanica</a> is a somewhat Crash Bandicoot-esque puzzle ‘n’ survival game in which you are an extra-terrestrial botanist making sense of prehistoric Earth, feat. Neanderthals and Dodos.</li>
<li>Let’s savagely rebut the chonky ‘take me to your chief mammoth hunter’ bonhomie of that last entry with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3885910/Alien_Morgue/">Alien Morgue</a>, in which you do autopsies on little green men. (You don’t appear to be playing a Neanderthal or a Dodo.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time to once again dust off those parched and abraded Zelda memories with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583520/Under_The_Island/">Under The Island</a>, a top-down island dungeon puzzler featuring six biomes replete with grass you can slash to reveal health hearts.</li>
<li>Friendslop’s bottomless chum bucket has claimed Cthulhu in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140720/Ritual_Party/">Ritual Party</a>, which is about four buds (or <em>are</em> you?) trying to perform a hellish ritual. Please, somebody help me think of a non-pejorative word for “friendslop” that rolls off the tongue as easily. The best I have are “Overcookie” and “Lethalcomp”.</li>
<li>No time for friendslop, actually, for today marks the dawning of duck-builders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">Placid Plastic Deck: A Quiet Quest</a> (pictured) is a deeply suspicious card-battler.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714150/Beyond_the_Doors/">Beyond The Doors</a> is a finicky surveillance sim in which you accept mysterious requests to bug your neighbours, while probing the enigmas of the architecture itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3514630/Roach_Post/">Roach Post</a> is a cheery roguelite puzzler in which you stick together postage stamps with the help of an army of cockroaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Forgotlings</a> is a posh-looking, VA-heavy action adventure set in a world of discarded sentient objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice cavernous origami world you’ve got there, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4240550/Blank/">Blank</a>. Shame if somebody were to platform all over it.</li>
<li>Equal parts horny, despairing and whimsical, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878760/KILL_THE_WITCH/">Kill The Witch</a> is an early access 2D action platformer in which you are a witch with a baseball bat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/">The Killing Stone</a> is an Inscryptic confection from the makers of The Blackout Club. You are in the Arctic, playing a cursed boardgame to save the souls of a noble family from the Devil.</li>
<li>The criminal absence of licensed music notwithstanding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> looks to be a pleasant “what if”-driven strategy management port of TV’s definitive trip to the Delta Quadrant. Off to the Transporter room with you, Neelix - you’re doing a one-man-raid on the Borg Cube.</li>
<li>People who pre-fur the Star Foxy breed of space sim might want to throw their pennies at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/"> FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>. Neelix’s tufty mug wouldn’t look out of place here, now that I think of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today brings quite the haul. Let’s barge through them at pace. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse</a> is a sun-baked mystery horror novel in which an ensemble cast wrangle with some ghastly fishwomen.</li>
<li>The N64-to-Gamecube era lives on in “expressive” platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Demon Tides</a>, which casts you as a transforming devil princess.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a> is your latest helping of putrid and snarky open world goblin stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">Love Eternal</a> is an introspective horror platformer we might blithely summarise as Playdead X Celeste. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Key Fairy</a> is a “hand-drawn, pacifist, folkloric, bullet-hell” game in which you grapple past monsters, salvaging their shattered stars, and solve riddles in a forest of scratchy blood and ink.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">Nightsoil</a> is possibly the first turd collection game I’ve covered, and certainly the first emotive turd collection game I’ve covered.</li>
<li>Get the sense that all is not well on this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622230/MOONROT/">particular gas giant moon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple more before we go gently into that good Friday night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949290/Ys_X_Proud_Nordics/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is an updated version of a 2023 entrant in the sprawling Ys series, best known (to me, anyway) for popularising the concept of bumpslash combat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525970/Horripilant/">Horripilant</a> is an incremental dungeon clicker about an old knight in a world of Junji Ito-esque filthbastards.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on in the Treehouse this week? James is biffing several larger hardware stories, and threatening to educate the rest of us about teraflops. Mark wants to walk the desert – hurting, longing, dancing to disco music. Julian may have an awkward tale to tell about a PC game he shouldn’t admit to have played. I am thinking about open worlds and city builders, because I am nothing if not shackled to genre. Callum is biding his time before the Requiem, and Ollie is eyeing the months ahead through a telescope (and also, possibly playing more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>). Jeremy ain’t in yet. How about you?</p>

            <p>There's nothing more spooky than having to neatly get your message across in a limited number of words which may or may not have to rhyme or stick to iambic pentameter. That's something Polish horror devs Bloober Team clearly understand, since they whipped out some William Blake poetry over the weekend, in order to reveal that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> 3 will be a thing.</p>

<p>The folks behind 2024's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> used this reveal to close out a Valentines' weekend showcase commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Layers of Fear series, which kicked off with 2016's Layers of Fear. In this cinematic teaser for the next entry, a creepy bloke creepily read through Blake's The Sick Rose while sitting in a creepy chair surrounded by creepy portraits, one of which was of a strange hairless creature with no nose and two pointed fangs. The poem goes <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43682/the-sick-rose">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Rose thou art sick.</p>
<p>The invisible worm,</p>
<p>That flies in the night</p>
<p>In the howling storm:</p>
<p>Has found out thy bed</p>
<p>Of crimson joy:</p>
<p>And his dark secret love</p>
<p>Does thy life destroy</p></blockquote>
<p>Midway through the creepy bloke's reading, one of the paintings falls off the wall. Rather than blaming shoddy sticking apparatus, the man instead said: "Don't you worry about my little friend there, he tries to help. But the poor thing hasn't quite got the hang of the afterlife yet."</p><p>The teaser ended with the creepy bloke getting creepily serious for a second and turning over an hourglass. Sadly, there was no indication of when Layers of Fear 3 might arrive, so it remains to the release dateless void for now.</p>
<p>"Layers of Fear is an effective scare 'em up but the sense of dislocation and the lack of character development left me feeling as if I'd enjoyed a thematically messy series of shocks rather than a cohesive horror story," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layers-of-fear-review">his review</a> of the first game in the series. "It's a collection of scary things that are tangentially related to the idea of creative blocks and familial cruelty rather than an exploration of the artist or his personality flaws. By the time the credits rolled, I knew very little about this particular painter that I couldn't have learned by reading a brief synopsis."</p>
<p>Here's hoping Layers of Fear 3's spooks delve a bit deeper and deliver an undeniably through scarening.</p>
