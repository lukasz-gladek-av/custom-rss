            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> providing VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is no more, after CD Projekt issued a takedown notice they claim hinged on them not being happy that the mod's creator had stuck it behind a paywall. In response, modder Luke Ross has accused the company of being all about making money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have noticed that two of my recent posts disappeared about a week ago. I apologize that I could not comment personally about the fact, because there was an ongoing legal exchange," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">Patreon post</a> over the weekend. "Now that the dust has settled, I'm even more sorry to announce that we are leaving behind an adventure that so many of you deeply loved and enjoyed. CD PROJEKT S.A. decided that they would follow in Take-Two Interactive Software's steps and issued a DMCA notice against me for the removal of the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod."</p>
<p>This Cyberpunk VR mod is actually just one limb of Ross' creation, which is dubbed R.E.A.L. VR and essentially serves as a framework offering various VR support forks for a bunch of different games. In order to grab Cyberpunk VR, folks have had to take out a paid subscription to Ross' Patreon (the modder does also list some works for free on <a href="https://github.com/LukeRoss00?tab=repositories">Github</a>). That, according to a post from CD Projekt business development vice president Jan Rosner, was the crux of this takedown strike.</p>
<p>"We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers)," Rosner wrote. "This directly violates our Fan Content Guidelines: we never allow monetisation of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place. We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’d like to briefly address the discussion around the “Cyberpunk VR” mod created by Luke Ross. We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers). This directly violates our Fan Content Guidelines: we never allow…</p>— Jan Rosner (@jan_rosner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jan_rosner/status/2013219892405604457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That, it would seem, isn't a road Ross is prepared to go down. "As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," the modder wrote. "And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy, and they cannot just be grateful about the extra copies of the title they sold because of that - without ever having to pour money into producing an official conversion (no, they're not planning to release their own VR port, in case you were wondering)."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Luke Ross, a pseudonym according to a 2022 report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">The Verge</a> which claimed the modder was making £20,000 per month from their VR modding efforts, has had a publisher issue them with a strike. As you might have gathered from their earlier mention of Take-Two, R.E.A.L. VR's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, and Mafia trilogy support had a copyright-focused takedown filed against them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>As for next steps, Ross used the end of that post to announce that they'd be putting out a VR mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> ahead of schedule, "without going through the ordinary testing cycle". On one hand, I understand at least some of the modder's ire at being asked via lawyers to change up how they make their living, but on the other, if the option to go free but with optional donations for Cyberpunk is there, that seems a decent compromise for CD Projekt to have offered.</p>

            <p>Historical real-time tactics game Strategos is out in early access today, boasting over 120 factions and 250 units based on “the major and minor powers of the ancient Mediterranean”, according to developers Strategos Games. If you are a brazen tomfool, you might summarise it as Total War without the sprawling campaign map element. If you are an <em>excessively</em> brazen tomfool – brazen to the point that a formation of Greek Hoplites would use you as cover while manouvering around some pesky Achaemenid Persian archers – you might also say that “Strategos” sounds like a spiky brand of cereal, rich in essential iron and horse sweat.</p>
<p>We neither of us are tomfools, however. We know better than to write such nonsense out loud. I’ve still yet to play Strategos, but I’ve been reading more about its “command and control” simulation, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">covering the news that MicroProse would publish the game</a>, and it does sound like a worthwhile complication of the process of clattering phalanxes together like frying pans.</p><!--more-->

<p>In brief, there’s a gap between giving an order and receiving or executing that order. Orders are issued by generals, rather than arriving magically in every unit’s brain whenever you left-click. To receive an order directly, units need to be within earshot of a general (some generals are louder, making them better commanders). If the general is too far away, they’ll need to send one of a finite number of couriers. Couriers can be intercepted and killed. Do you see? I have played wargames that make communication a feature in this way, but not recently.</p><p>Even if an order is successfully delivered, units may act independently, based on what’s going on nearby. They may choose their own targets. They can be goaded by enemies. Having one of your generals ride up to offer morale support and instructions is one way of countering this, along with keeping units in reserve to plug the line.</p>
<p>Units may also take unprompted tactical breathers after a certain amount of time spearing each other’s bellies, rather than grinding away till they rout, as in Twar. As the developers explained to <a href="https://strategyandwargaming.com/2025/03/27/is-this-the-new-total-war-strategos-exclusive-interview/">Strategy And Wargaming</a> last March, “[o]ngoing combats can also periodically shift into a mutual ‘passive’ mode where the two sides, although still locked into melee, fall back for a rest during which combats are not resolved and they can rally (and they may hurl some missiles at each other if available), which is part of the ‘Pulse Model’ of ancient warfare that inspired much of Strategos.”</p>
<p>I consider all this very juicy, and I’m sad we don’t have some review impressions to share with you. That said, the game has only just launched into early access, so there’s time yet to flank the bastards and treat them to a vigorous Wot-I-Thinking. The plan is for it to launch into 1.0 in early 2027 or so. The current build includes five historical campaigns, nine reenactment battles, and one map-based campaign, and the devs aim to “add additional scenarios and units (including chariots), along with a more refined map-based campaign”.
