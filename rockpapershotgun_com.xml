        <p>Ah, yes. The rare 'good videogame'.</p>

            <p>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/showa-american-story">Showa American Story</a> is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:</p>

<p>It’s so wonderful, somewhere between RGG and Grasshopper Manufacture, with a little bit of one of my all time favourite films, Tokyo Gore Police, thrown in for good measure. It’s “a brand new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> and an enthusiastic love letter to the 80s' pop culture that features a strong taste of B-Movies,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687540/Showa_American_Story/">Steam</a>. “Follow Choko's journey of truth and revenge across North America as she grows stronger.” It’s from Nekcom, who previously put out the confoundingly named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699700/DYING_Reborn/">DYING: Reborn</a> - a gory escape room. Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Showa 66, Japan has bought out most of the United States with its strong economic power. A surge of immigration has firmly planted Japanese culture within the American continent. Two cultures are rapidly amalgamated, although conflicts are inevitable, citizens gradually adapt to a life never imagined as time goes by.</p>
<p>However, a mysterious catastrophic incident changes the world drastically. The social order is long gone. An unknown amount of time passes, a teenage girl mysteriously revives from the dead, only to find a brand new wild post-apocalyptic world with zombies, monsters, and human survivors of different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as combat, you’ll be travelling around the US in a “big” RV. It’s big! You’ll be able to customise it, as well as “enhance Choko's status and unlock abilities through various enjoyable "Living Activities". Finally, the enjoyable living activities I crave. No release date on this one yet, but you can bet I’ll be shouting loudly about it as soon as we get one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
