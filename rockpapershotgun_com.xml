            <p>Electronic Arts, publishers of Clive Barker's Undying and Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari, have let employees know that they're ending full remote working and hiring, and implementing return to office for all employees as part of hybrid work plans, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">reports IGN</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In-person work results in a "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players," said CEO and unholy human-blazer hybrid Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, viewed by IGN. As a player, I do wish these people would stop speaking for me to make their employees' lives worse</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that all employees of the company within 30 miles of an EA building will be forced to transition to a hybrid work model with at least three days a week in office. Those outside this radius will be, according to the somewhat ominous wording in an email to employees from president Laura Miele, "considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid".</p>
<p>IGN chatted to several employees anonymously, who report feeling upset, confused, or unsure about what will happen to their jobs if they couldn't move within that 30 mile radius. "Existing remote workers would have their 'exemptions' to return to office 'sunset' sometime in the next 3 to 24 months," two sources explained to IGN. Childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes were all given as reasons. RTO mandates are sometimes referred to as "quiet layoffs"  due to these sorts of issues - at some level, EA must be aware that some of their employees would find it impossible to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p>EA recently laid off around 300 workers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">around 100 at Titanfall studio Respawn</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">they laid off 5% of their workforce, close to 670</a>. Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million between them in 2024</a>. According to one Ebay listing I found, this is enough to buy 3 million second hand copies of Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari - far more copies than anyone would ever need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Stab-o-sneak merchants Ubisoft are pushing back the release of several unspecified big name projects in the wake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which CEO Yves Guillemot says "has reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand". The tactical snoop 'n' shoot peddlers are also looking to cut costs by at least €100 million across their organisation, following a difficult year in which they've partnered with Tencent to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">launch a new corporate subsidiary</a> dedicated to their most popular games.</p><!--more-->
<p>"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," observed Guillemot in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">Ubi's latest earnings results</a>, adding that the company's overall earnings for the past year are "slightly below objective". He says they're in a strong position regardless thanks to the "discipline applied across the Group", which presumably includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">those mass layoffs in January</a>, amongst other cutbacks. According to the earnings call, Ubisoft have shrunk their staff headcount by "around 3,000" since the end of September 2022.</p>
<p>By "discipline", Guillemot is also probably referring to Ubisoft's repeated delaying of Assassin's Creed Shadows to ensure a more positive reception than that achieved by last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. He says the delay has paid off, with Shadows having the second highest launch day revenue of any game in the series. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment," the Ubiboss continued. "It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favourable community response from long-time fans and new players alike."</p>
<p>Guillemot says Ubisoft have completed their cost-cutting plans "ahead of schedule". Still, management remain focussed on "discipline", with plans for "additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organization". So, more job losses then?</p>
<p>Ubisoft are also still completing the creation of their new Tencent-backed subsidiary, which will oversee development of future Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six games. We can expect a "new organisation" to be announced later this year. The publishers have also "decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success", which means that "[Financial Year] 2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."</p>
<p>The rest of Ubisoft's 2025 and early 2026 will look relatively trim by comparison. On PC, we can expect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era, together with expansions for Assassin's Creed Shadows and, just possibly, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake</a>.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf">slideshow presentation</a> maintains Ubisoft's commitment to the two wolves that lurk inside every triple-A game company - "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> adventures" and "GaaS-native experiences", aka live service games. They want to both "improve the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences" and serve up "richer multiplayer features with more frequent content updates".</p>
<p>I don't see any mention here of "disciplining" executive salaries and compensation, but to give the Devil his due, Guillemot has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-is-taking-a-large-paycut">taken paycuts over poor company performance</a> in the past.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Friends, it is my sad duty to inform you that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/one-million-checkboxes">One Million Checkboxes</a> creator Neal Agarwal is up to more of his crowdgaming mischief. He’s published another online squabbling sim called Internet Roadtrip. It’s a roaming Google Streetview cam in which viewers vote on the direction of travel every 10 seconds. The thinking behind Saltybet applied to the experience of driving your kids to Disney Land, in short. It is possibly a commentary on self-piloting vehicles, but mostly, it is a celebration of the raucous magic of chatboxes. You can also vote to honk the horn.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
At the time of publication, the vehicle has travelled 573 miles and there are around 1000 drivers online. 1000 strangers, some of whom appear to be either pleasantly stoned or wildly over-caffeinated, screaming instructions at a phantom Tesla. Currently, we are coasting down Church Street in Gardiner, Maine, and there is a heated argument in chat about the politics of turning right or left of the church.</p>
<p>The leftists carry the debate, for once, and we sail down the highway past a crop of trees. #1 Eastern White Pine Fan takes a moment to grieve the plight of the majestic ash. “It’s so bittersweet,” they write. “i love them but they're almost all dead on the east coast now, since the emerald ash borer devastated all ash species native to north america.” Thank you, #1 Eastern White Pine Fan.
</p>
<p>
A contingent of viewers are obsessed with driving to Canada. “Can we get to Canada before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>,” asks user Crab, thus doing the SEO-minded news writers in the viewership a real solid. The Canada faction are opposed by a posse of staunch Agarwal fanbois who are hellbent on making the vehicle circle Neal Street forever.</p>
<p>User Pingu throws a spanner in the works by abruptly demanding that we head to Mexico. It’s clear that quite a lot of the commenters are locals. “EVERYBODY STAY ON 9,” insists Pothos, Leader Of The Pathists. Oh we’re on Maine Avenue now, crossing a bridge. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts. Can we stop for doughnuts? Alas no, but we can honk if we love doughnuts. Which we do.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/">Find Internet Roadtrip here</a>. It's free, but Agarwal is accepting donations by way of that clickable coffee cup. As is the way of anonymous communications platforms, the chat is probably going to become a trashfire at some stage. I sense that Agarwal has applied automatic filters for slurs and hate speech, but as we have found when moderating RPS comments, bigots can be creative. If you’re just here to settle back and enjoy the ambience of, right now, Cheney Road in Chelsea, Agarwal has considerately built in an FM radio. You have to vote to change the station, mind.
