A. Corey novels and Syfy TV adaptations. It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics. Also, crew romances. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Explore a Divided Solar System: Travel across iconic locations from the TV show and books, like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. While traversing the various environments, players must uncover secrets and influence outcomes through their skills and decisions.</p>
<p>A Story-Driven RPG True to The Expanse: Immerse yourself in a narrative grounded in tension, consequence, and the complexity of humanity's future among the stars</p></blockquote>
<p>Osiris Reborn is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727390/The_Expanse_Osiris_Reborn/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-736f65">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_expanse_osiris_reborn">GOG</a> at a date that is not today, nor tomorrow, but "soon".</p>
<p>The developers are at pains to reassure that they've got a whole new team working on the thing and that there is no overlap with any of Owlcat's other projects, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-is-the-next-tactical-and-bloody-crpg-from-the-devs-behind-rogue-trader">the recently revealed Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>. They're collaborating on the game with Alcon Interactive Group, publishers of The Expanse: A Telltale Story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a>? That was a bloody lovely game. I'm always partial to a game where photography is the core mechanic, there's such a specific joy in navigating a space attempting to capture a fracture of its essence. Photo modes just aren't the same, I want someone to textually give me a camera and send me on my way. A sequel was announced last year, quite simply called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem-2">Toem 2</a>, and during yesterday's Day of the Devs, some gameplay was shown off for the first time.

Essentially, it looks like more of the same (which I want to quickly make clear is a wonderful thing), albeit clearly with a few more years of artistic experience under the developers' belts. Environments are fully 3D now, rather than what (I'm guessing) were all 2D textures mapped onto 3D objects. You're still out on an adventure, taking pictures along the way to uncover a phenomenon that is being kept hush, hush for the time being.

The sequel will feature special NPCs called Friends (aww), all of which have their own unique questline. Once you've wrapped up a quest, they'll give you a camera tool like, uh, scissors! Which cut things! As scissors are want to do. Or you'll get a hammer, no prize for guessing what that does. None of these things sound particularly camera related, but they look like fun ways to interact with the world. You can jump around and climb things now too, lots of ways to have some fun outside of taking a picture of a cheeky gnome.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for Toem 2 just yet, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">here</a>!

If we're being honest with ourselves, the original PSP was a sort of Proto-Switch too, no? As in it was home to a lot of odd, smaller-scope games that not many other platforms might have featured outside of Nintendo's earlier handhelds. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/patapon">Patapon</a> was one such tiny oddity, one of the most charming games on the platform, if not to ever outright exist. It did go on to get a couple of sequels, but the series (outside of an upcoming remaster of the first two) is sort of dead. Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, a spiritual successor from Patapon's creator is here to satisfy your tiny-guy-chanting-to-music needs with a newly revealed release date!
</p>

Featured during yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation, it was revealed that the rhythm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action game (take a shot for every genre it mixes) will be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/">Steam in early access</a> next month on July 25th. I'm quite excited by this one personally, those little chants in the original Patapon are burnt into my ear canals, I'm looking forward to getting something fresh in there that I can also repeat to myself ad infinitum. Yes that sounds like someone's personal hell, I just love a good chant.

Luckily, none of us actually have to wait to check it out either. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo</a> you can give a punt right now, something I'll be trying to fit in amongst the 1000 showcases taking place this week. The one thing I'm uncertain of is the roguelike element - outside of that it just looks like an incredibly lush and colourful, modern take on an old classic. Whether that roguelike quality will rob itself of tightly designed levels is something I'll have to find out for myself.
</p>
<p>
Ratatan also differs slightly in that you can freely move the little guys around, adding an extra tactical layer to it all. I will cry if even one of the Ratatans die, so, I'll be working hard to make the right choices.
