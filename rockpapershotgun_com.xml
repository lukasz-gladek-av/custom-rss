One a them Star Wars was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-a-kotor-spiritual-successor-rpg-led-by-mass-effects-casey-hudson">announced</a> at the Let Geoff Have This He's Got Nothing Else Going On Awards this week, from none other than Casey Hudson. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, a name that will instantly make any Knights of the Old Republic oldhead point at their screen that's Chappie style, which also happens to be a game that Hudson was project director on. The only problem with Fate of the Old Republic is that the studio that's making it only got started this year, calling into question how far away it is - a question that Hudson, kind of, answered.
</p>
<p>
As noted, developer of the game Arcanaut Studios is a wee babby of a studio, with RPS overlord Julian pointing out in his and Mark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-game-awards-2025">Geoffies verdict</a> that optimistically, we'd be looking at a 2028 or 2029 release date for the game. Hudson's response to such an estimation (which is more likely in direct response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">some guy who often seems to know a lot about what happens in the industry</a>) is one of unconvincing substance. "Don’t worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," he wrote on his personal Dwitter account. "Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!"

<p>
You're honestly trying to convince us that a game of likely quite a large scale, with probably too many people working on it, that only has a quite short, pre-rendered trailer that shows off scenes you could find in literally any modern day Star Wars, will be out within the next four years? Hogwash! Malarkey! Balderdash! This isn't the '90s, or the 2000s, or even the 2010s, big name games almost always get delayed, whether it's internally or externally, and I can't see that not happening to this one.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of Hudson and his team at Arcanaut, I do genuinely hope they manage to get it done within such a timeframe, and done in a healthy manner, even if I don't believe it to be possible. You see the water droplets in that trailer? That looked like fricken' real life! If that's what they're aiming for, only the gods can help them.

            <p>
There is something that lies in the belly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> that makes me recoil. The surface level concept is easy enough to follow. It is a 2D pixel art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> where you play as a "forsaken nun" who "walks the long road to absolution." The world you find yourself in in the game's demo is overbearing, crushing. Initially you find yourself in the depths of a church, and even that is worth questioning - what church has depths? When you come across a device, and what on the offset looks like gothic horror a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> becomes perplexingly technological.
</p>
<p>
This device is, mechanically speaking, your main menu. Booting up this menu, you are met with a voice, in text form, that asks you to speak to it. You type in help, literally, with your real-world keyboard, and it gives you a list of options: inventory, journal, settings, all of them with appropriate descriptions, and then OS, the only bit of detail about this option being "me." What else could OS be but operating system, and if that's true, what kind of a world is this?

<p>
These questions go unanswered in the demo, because why would they be, but we must press on. Which would be all well and good if pressing on wasn't such a challenge. Metamorphosis harbours a cruel reality, one where you can die quite quickly and easily, its disgustingly abstract enemies frightening enough to cause you to panic, the purposefully dim lighting causing you to second guess every shadow and precarious jump. Dying puts you right back to where you last saved, which can, of course, be longer ago than you wished it was, and further back to - you can only save at certain points, unless you have some candles to make temporary restore points.
</p><p>
Despite writing for a PC site, I am not particularly good at playing with a keyboard and mouse, and while Metamorphosis is playable on controller, most of the tutorialisation UI is for PC only, forcing me into the old ways as I wasn't sure which button did what. There are a lot of buttons to keep in mind in this game, making it a touch challenging in a potentially unfair way, though I can forgive this for now, as the atmosphere has won me over.
</p>
<p>
Metamorphosis doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and maybe check out its demo for yourself, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470140/METAMORPHOSIS/">here</a>.

            <p>
There has never been a time where the presence of a big Hollywood celeb making an appearance in a video game has drawn me in. Who cares! Most of the time they are not voice actors, and are just doing their own voice, maybe sometimes lending their face. And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice-elevenlabs-1236574041/">happily lending his voice to some AI software</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>, a game that's basically just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.

<p>
"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," co-founder of Exodus studio Archetype Chad Robertson explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Eurogamer</a> when asked if the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past actor was at all AI-generated in-game.

"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used. The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific."
</p><p>
Robertson also touched on what the studio's long-term stance on AI is, which is currently essentially they have none, but will "have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves," as the tech becomes more widely used. When it comes to Exodus, Robertson also clarified that there's no AI to be found in it: "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan."
</p>
<p>
A current lack of AI doesn't convince me of the game right now, personally. There's nothing about it that screams particularly unique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">sci-fi</a>, just perhaps expensive sci-fi, which is often the worst and most boring kind. Still, it's a while away until any of us find out if that is the case or not, as its Geoffies trailer also positioned it for a 2027 release date.

            <p>
It's funny to think that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a>, one of those cosy-ish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafty type of games doesn't have farming just yet, but I suppose that's understandable given it is an early access game. Doesn't matter much either, as farming will be coming to the game next week as part of its Fellhollow update, which just got another look-in through a new gameplay trailer that also shows off all sorts of undead bashing you'll be doing.
</p>
<p>
Where thus far the game has presented a slightly more idyllic fantasy world, Fellhollow looks like it is filled with giant, very indigo orcish brutes, zombie-esque creatures with three flavours of haircut (bald on top, bald at the front, bald), a dragon (it's in the name!), and quite angry skeletons. Well, there's one friendly skeleton that's only a skull who makes a pun so groanworthy not even the strapline of an RPS story would welcome it.

<p>
That aforementioned dragon is a smaller one that appears to appear somewhere in the overworld, though it also looks like you'll be able to do noble battle with a much bigger, sometimes invisible, always with its chest completely cut open dragon that'll probably do a number on you and your mates if you're not careful.
</p><p>
And, of course there's the farming, which sounds suitably in depth. The type of seed your planting will need to be planted in a different kind of planter, ash, oak, or willow. Watering them requires some thinking, as you can either use dirty water from your watering can, or clean water from a well or raincatcher barrel. You can also forgo doing the watering yourself and cast a spell instead. There's even composting! And there are other new spells too like uproot, which as you can probably guess uproots any of your veggies from the ground.
</p>
<p>
It all seems varied enough, and I'm sure it will be enjoyable if you're particularly into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>'s flavour of fantasy. Fellhollow will be available as a free update next week, December 15th.

            <p>
Satire is a genre that you find often enough in mediums like film and television, but there is an argument to be made that it doesn't happen as often in games, and that maybe, this is due for a reckoning. This is the argument that Davide Soliani (Mario + Rabbids) and Christian Cantamessa (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>) are making about the game they're co-directing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bradley-the-badger">Bradley the Badger</a>, a comedic, half-throwback, half-fresh-take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> revealed at The Geoff Keighley Night this week.
</p>
<p>
"The film and television industry has a long history now of parody and satire," Cantamessa told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/this-is-a-love-letter-to-games-first-look-at-davide-solianis-game-awards-surprise-bradley-the-badger/">VGC</a> in an interview that went up alongside the reveal. "In Hollywood, they call it navel-gazing, but it’s healthy, it’s humorous, it’s fun. It opens up some of the dusty closets to the audience, which always has an interest in how the sausage is made."

<p>
He went on to mention Seth Rogen's recent Hollywood satire show The Studio, noting if the TV industry is ready for that, "and the film industry has Birdman, the comic book industry has Deadpool… I think the games industry is ready for a healthy dose of satire."
</p><p>
This is, perhaps, a bit of an odd framing to take, in that it makes it sound like there has never been any satirical games, though I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Portal, and even arguably much older games like Earthbound might have something to say about that. Hell, let's not forget Conker's Bad Fur Day, a game that Bradley the Badger clearly partially pulls from.
</p>
<p>
To give the game some credit, it does look quite fun! A game about a game falling apart and seeing behind the code so to speak is not a novel concept necessarily, but I like the look of the systems that let titular Bradley be a game dev himself. And it's being more directly satirical of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> and Cyberpunk, which is admittedly not a common thing to do, though I wonder if this didn't have such big industry names attached to it whether it would get away with such presentations.
</p>
<p>
Whether Bradley the Badger will be successful in its satire, or even just being a good game, we'll have to wait and find out, but you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">here</a> if you're curious about it all the same.
