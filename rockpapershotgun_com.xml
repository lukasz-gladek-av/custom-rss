            <p>I'd have loved to delve into some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">Next Fest</a> shenanigans, but at the moment guidestown is groaning with work. And there are only so many times I can listen to the <a href="https://youtu.be/n8Zn5bjqKdo">Endless Legend soundtrack</a> in one day. I need to expand my horizons.</p>
<p> Come on, let loose. I need all your best game soundtrack recommendations for background music while I work. Nothing intense, no combat music, nothing too distracting. Just a nice vibe. Something to get lost in over time. Now gimme what you got! It's urgent!</p>

            <p>
One of the internet's primordial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art">New Media</a> experiences is the Wiki Game - an asymmetrical "racing sim" in which you hurry from one Wikipedia page to another by clicking on the fewest number of links. Try doing that in the Museum of All Things, "a nearly-infinite virtual museum generated from Wikipedia", which you can <a href="https://mayeclair.itch.io/museum-of-all-things">download for free from Itch</a>. Devised by <a href="https://may.as/">Maya Claire</a> using the Godot Engine with audio from Neomoon's Willow Wolf, it's either a charmingly unusual way to browse a wonderful public resource or a free-associative liminal death-spiral, depending on your mood going in.
</p>
<p>
The Museum pulls down and generates new exhibition spaces from individual Wikipedia pages as you explore. Its scale is limited only by the quantity of cache memory you assign it in the settings. Needless to say, you'll need to be online for it to work. There's no attempt to disguise the procgen: instead, the simulation makes an insidiously graceful spectacle of its own self-assembly. Marble displays, neatly captioned imagery and overhead light fittings slide and rattle into view as you enter rooms (again, you can decide the proximity at which they appear in the settings). Instead of hyperlinks, there are little signs with arrows pointing you down a tunnel to a relevant exhibit.
</p>
<p>
If the Museum Of All Things is a celebration of Wikipedia, with the option of jumping out from the pause menu to visit the relevant page in a browser, the glamour of its generation quickly takes priority over the act of retrieving information. The air-con serenades you steadily as you venture down one staircase after another, pursuing a layout that is unapologetically non-Euclidean, with entire schools of thought and the wisdom of bygone ages tucked Tardis-like inside blocks a few metres wide. 
</p>
<p>
This space is vast beyond comprehension, and yet, terribly small, for each room's architecture is the same collection of assets, elegantly rearranged. The polished wooden floors reflect the exhibits but you can't see yourself in them. A distorted background tone intrudes upon the hum of the air-con - is that a tannoy announcement? Somebody singing? Oh hell, I have to get out. I tumble down the corridor to "Butter Tea", hurry on through into "List of Butter Dishes", then "Dish (food)", then "Eat", then "Chewing", then "Teeth". I pause before a diagram of a rat's incisor and I know that the rat is me. The Museum has me now. Please, come find me.
