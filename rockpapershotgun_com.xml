            <p>A demo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be playable at this year's Gamescom, with Microsoft set to show it off in tandem with the first public exhibition of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">ROG Xbox Ally</a> handheld. </p>
<p>Yep, the fates of this long-awaited Metroidvania sequel and Asus' Xbox-branded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">portable PC</a> continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld">intertwine</a>, like star-crossed lovers. Well, aside from how star-crossed lovers are traditionally bound by love and crossed stars, not a desire to make money and also a desire to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">make more money</a>.</p>

<p>Right, before you ask, there's still no full release date for Silksong as I write this. It's still just coming at some point in what remains of 2025. Got it? Ok, on we go. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_7.28.1">Xbox have announced</a> it'll be one of the games coming "this Holiday and beyond" with a playable demo at the console makers' booth in Cologne.</p>
<p>They didn't offer much more info as to what you can expect from the Silksong demo, which comes just a little bit prior to the game's much-discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">Australian museum cameo</a> in September. Well, aside from the fact it's one of the games you'll be able to give a go on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are also set to come out later this year (it'll be playable on conventional PCs as well).</p>
<p>The likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> are also set to be playable in some form outside of the handheld demos, while an upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> city update will be shown off as well. You can also celebrate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s Order of Giants DLC being set to arrive soon by, er, playing the base game again on the show floor. Just in case you forgot what hat man looked like.</p>
<p>I'd say why not bake a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">big Silksong-themed cake</a> to take with you if you're going to the German leg of the summergamesthings, but given the company running its booth recently executed some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">horrible mass layoffs</a>, maybe not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-as-xbox-offer-first-chances-to-fiddle-with-the-rog-xbox-ally]]></content:encoded>
