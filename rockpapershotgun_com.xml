            <p>
Around May last year, the one and only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/ron-gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">Monkey Island</a> fame announced an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that was meant to be some kind of mix between classic Zelda, and Diablo, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, that last one being another of the game designer's notable works. It never got a full reveal, or even a name, and unfortunately it seems it never will, as it's essentially been canned.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert recently spoke with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Ars Technica</a> about his career, including his most recently released game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ron-gilberts-new-death-by-scrolling-rpg-about-never-ending-grind-and-the-absurdity-of-social-media-is-out-now">Death by Scrolling</a>, which just launched this October, but the interview kicks off by discussing his unnamed RPG. The designer explained that after working on adventure games like Thimbleweed Park and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> for a good many years, he was "thinking about something new."
</p>
<p>
That something new resulted in Gilbert hiring an artist and another designer, putting a year's worth of time into the aforementioned RPG. The problem? Not enough people, and as is the case with most of life, not enough money. "I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained. "You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."
</p>
<p>
For Gilbert, bringing in funds was tougher than he thought it would be. He tried pitching the game to various places, but "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible." He continued, "Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in.' The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."
</p><p>
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter don't work so well these days either, as Gilbert's Thimbleweed Park also went that route, and while it wracked up more than $600,000, the game dev noted that it still had private investors providing half of the game's final budget.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly just another reminder that making games isn't just hard because they're technically complex, but they have material necessities that can't always be met due to external forces. Would be nice if someone did something about that. Revolution anyone?

            <p>
I can only assume that Halloween's proximity to Christmas is the reason as to why there is so much winter holiday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> media. Perhaps it's even just as simple as the fact that people like it when Christmas is a little bit messed up! Either way, I do actually enjoy some Chrimbo horror, so I'm pleased to see the return of Haunted PS1's Madvent Calendar this year, which just so happens to have launched today.
</p>
<p>
For those that need the rundown on how the whole thing works, it's essentially a package of 24 different games, all vaguely horrory and Christmassy in one way or another. This year's iteration, Madvent Calendar 5: Post Mortem, is no different, bringing with it a gaggle of goodies that, I should note, are varying degrees of polished. Expect the kind of bits you might see in a game jam, basically.

You can play every single game on offer as soon as it's been downloaded, though that technically defeats the point of an advent calendar. Still, to give you an idea of what to expect, I'll run you through a few of the games on offer. Spoiler warning I suppose? Stand clear if you want to discover them for yourself!
</p><p>
Day one puts you in a fuzzy, pixelated world where you can do two things: rip, and knock. It throws you in with little context, making it genuinely quite unnerving. Sort of felt like I was being born at one point? Weird stuff! Another entry puts you in the role of a zombie girl who has been recruited by an eye-patch wearing Santa to help with the war on Christmas. This one's kind of a cross between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> and Spyro, and is just quite a little neat 3D platformer that with some extra finessing could feature some solid movement mechanics.
</p>
<p>
I'm always a fan of all the Haunted PS1 demo discs, their Madvent Calendars, and the odd one of projects too. It's a real boon of bite sized creativity, and well worth dipping into if the holiday season feels just a tad too cheerful for your liking. You can pick it up for free on itch.io right <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/madvent5">here</a>.
