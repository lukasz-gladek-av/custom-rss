            <p>"Kept you waiting, huh?" says Snake. Uh, no, not really. You're actually a bit early this time, mate. The release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> was spotted this week, hiding in the long grass of the PlayStation Store. The fancy-schmancy MGS3 remake is coming out in August, according to the store page. And you can also catch sight of a camouflaged trailer if you go looking under the right rocks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The release date was listed as August 28th on the game's PlayStation page. It has since been taken down and replaced with the vague "2025" but it still appears at the end of a trailer that leaked alongside the date. You can watch it by inspecting <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">this mossy URL</a> that looks a bit too human-shaped. </p>
<p>The video shows the bosses our boy must boss about before he beats <em>The</em> Boss and becomes his own Big Boss. You remember all these bad guys from the 2004 original, right? The Fear is a man covered in bees. The Sorrow is a ghostly dude who likes swimming. The Fury is a cosmonaut with a flamethrower. The Vibe is an influencer who vapes eels. Okay I made that last one up. </p>
<p>The release date and trailer haven't been officially announced by Konami yet. It's possible they were planning to unveil it during the next State Of Play broadcast, PlayStation's bi-annual showing off of upcoming games. This has been teased by <a href="https://x.com/Nef_216/status/1885474217132511569">industry rumourmonger NateTheHate</a> as happening some time next week, possibly on Valentine's Day. PlayStation held a State of Play broadcast on February 23rd last year, so there is a precedent for it landing around this time. </p><p>MGS Delta is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">our 50 most anticipated games of 2025</a>. A lot of that anticipation rides on good memories of the game going full Kojima. You could kill one boss, an elderly but gifted sniper called "The End", just by fast-forwarding the clock in the settings of your PlayStation 2 until the freakishly accurate geezer died of old age. It is twenty years later, I am almost as old as The End myself, and I still think this gimmick is very funny. </p>
<p>Also, did you know that MGS3's love interest and motor-bi-cyclist Eva was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-have-new-dialogue-and-evas-actor-reveals-why-she-chose-a-pseudonym-based-on-her-pet-dog">voiced by the actor who played Ariel</a> in Disney's The Little Mermaid? We got a lot more facts where these come from here at The Rock, The Paper, And Not Forgetting The Shotgun Dot Com. Keep us open in one tab at all times. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio's employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2s-aladdin-will-trap-players-in-a-lamp-with-an-angry-genie-as-the-moba-becomes-free-to-play">free-to-play beta</a>. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-company">Rogue Company</a> will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In light of challenging market conditions, Hi-Rez is implementing a reduction in force," the studio said in a Discord message <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/smite-and-paladins-dead-as-hi-rez-lays-off-dozens-of-employees-3058743/">spotted by Dexerto</a>. "Smite 2 will continue to be the focus of the newly streamlined operations. These reductions should enable a steady flow of new content and the continued development of Smite 2, while aligning team costs with revenues."</p>
<p>Hi-Rez haven't stated the exact number of people they've axed from the workplace. But <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/">a Reddit megathread of workers affected</a> includes 23 people at the time of writing, while Smite YouTuber "Hayzer" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eazBFw1skA4">estimates 50-60 people have been hit</a>. Among those hit are programmers, UI artists, QA folk, marketing people, and producers - a full grab-bag of roles. </p>
<p>This comes just four months after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">last round of job cuts at the company</a>, which itself followed a round of cuts in June 2023 (that one saw around 30 people made unemployed). All these emnployees have been shown the door to give Smite 2 "sustainability", according to Hi-Rez management. The CEO of Hi-Rez, Stewart Chisam, deleted his social media account on X in the aftermath of this week's layoffs. </p><p>As for all the non-Smite 2 games, the studio is still keeping Paladins up even if it won't see any further updates. "We plan to keep the servers and currently available content running as long as possible to allow you to continue to enjoy the game," they say. The first Smite will get the same treatment for now. The previous layoffs saw these two games being staffed by "small teams supporting light updates". But now it seems even those small teams are not wanted by the company.</p>
<p>I'm no business bro, but things don't look good for Hi-Rez in general. Aside from the continuing self-bleeding of talent from the studio, they've now gone all-in on a MOBA that frankly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">isn't that exciting</a> according to our reviewer Matt (RPS in peace), who noted that Valve's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is already halfway up its own lanes and looking quite beefy.</p>
<p>It continues to be a hard few years for workers in the games industry. We keep a tag that tracks recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>. But to be honest, it's hard to catch and report on them all. Especially when companies like BioWare <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">refuse to speak in plain language</a> about their job cuts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Put your red and white scarf back on the coat rack, football friends. The match has been called off. The entire season, in fact. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 25</a> has been cancelled because it has not met a high enough standard in time for its intended release next month, according to developers Sports Interactive. Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be given a refund, they say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25 and shift our focus to the next release," said the developers in <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">a statement</a>. "Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be... we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</p>
<p>"We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year."</p>
<p>This other game is a reference to the next instalment, Football Manager 26. The devs are now just working on that one instead.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive have previously hyped up the now-binned sideline shouter, pitching it as a fresh start for the series. It would be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">"for the first time in decades, a true sequel"</a> with a new graphics engine, revamped UI, women's football, better animations, the works. It announced a short delay to its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-managers-biggest-technical-and-visual-advancement-for-a-generation-arrives-november-but-sports-interactive-are-keen-to-lower-expectations">release date</a> in November 2024. But just one week after that it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed again until March 2025</a>. </p><p>Now, it's not happening at all, and that fresh start will have to kick off next football season. It's a surprisingly late cancellation, and a somewhat last minute announcement. Sports Interactive couldn't tell fans the bad news until now, they say, because lawyers said so. </p>
<p>"Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement," they said.</p>
<p>As for getting your money back, if you pre-ordered you'll get automatically refunded in full through whatever platform you bought it on, so long as it's an "official SEGA-approved retailer." That <a href="https://privacy.sega.com/en/sega-europe-approved-partner-list">list</a> includes Steam, Epic, Humble and a bunch of other places. It's only bad news if you bought your tickets to this big game from a CD Keys tout. Either way, take off your red and white bobble hat and come back inside for a cuppa. No, I don't know what team you support. It's the red and white one. They're all red and white, aren't they? That's the colour of football.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
