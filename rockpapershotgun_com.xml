<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is fast approaching its first anniversary, meaning if it were a real human baby it would be legally unable to do anything really because have you met a one year old? Still, ahead of that anniversary, Capcom has outlined the game's next big update which, shock horror, includes a new monster to hunt, a new weapon to hunt with, a collab with basically itself, and more coming on February 18th. Oh, and there's DLC coming! But once again, the horror, the shock.
</p>
<p>
First, that new monster; this one is the 10 star Arch-tempered Arkveld which is joining as part of a permanent event quest. He's a big, dark, lightningy looking guy, not much to say about him. That new weapon is a doozy, at least stylistically, as it's basically what if Cloud's Buster Sword was a broken mirror. Looking mighty fine honestly, and comes as part of a weapon design contest, made by one Nolan Lu. Nice work Nolan!

<p>
The aforementioned collab is specifically with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> 3: Twisted Reflection (you see, itself!), which features a new side mission you can only get if you have a hunter rank of nine or higher. It's permanent though, so don't worry about missing out on it. The mission itself sees you teaming up with Rudy, a more cel shaded Palico from Stories 3, who needs you to find some monster eggs he dropped. Deliver enough eggs, and you can get rewards like a Rudy costume for your Palico, and a few different pendants too.
</p><p>
From the release of this update on February 18th through to March 18th, there'll be an anniversary event where you can "collect a special anniversary login bonus, and join in the seasonal festivities—a weekly rotation of each previous Festival of Accord!"
</p>
<p>
In terms of the DLC, details are slim pickings, but it will apparently be a "large-scale expansion," with plans to share more details about it in the summer according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">Steam blog post</a>. It's something I guess! Look forward to it at your own risk.

If you like your board games a little less physical, and a little more not technically a board game any more if we're being honest but that's fine because it's a neat looking, strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now, then boooooy howdy do I have the game for you! Those familiar with the dungeon crawling tabletop game Descent will be interested to learn that it's getting a video game adaptation in the form of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent.
</p>
<p>
Before we press on, I'd just like to say that it's specifically Terrinoth with the all rights reserved symbol, <em>then</em> it says Heroes of Descent. That's silly! Don't do that! It makes your game name look weird. Anyway, this just so happens to be the first game adaptation of the modern classic board game, and it's sounding like a pretty tight experience overall.

<p>
For starters, there's eight different adventurers to choose from, which judging from the trailer includes some guys that can do magic, some gals that can slice 'n' dice or shoot a bow and arrow, a thiefy lookin' fellow, the usual kind of fantasy RPG type characters. Dungeon crawling is still the name of the game too, with apparently 20 dungeons to play through, all with different storylines, and characters that'll adapt to whichever adventurers make up your party.
</p><p>
I quite like that on the Steam page it highlights that the different missions you can complete in the main campaign can be beaten in one night, makes it feel like it's going for a "getting the gang together for DnD" kind of vibe. Which you can do! Because there's co-op for up to four people at once.
</p>
<p>
The combat is described as accessible, though that is more meant in terms of it being not annoyingly complex as opposed to having accessibility features. It's turn-based, with a big emphasis on positioning, elevation, line of sight, and timing, all that jazz. For those more familiar with the board game's story, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is also a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, but that'll probably mean more to those in the know than it does to me.
</p>
<p>
And there's even a demo you can try out right now, which is quite nifty as there's no release date other than sometime this year, so it'll give you something to mess around with until then. You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929630/Terrinoth_Heroes_of_Descent/">here</a>.
