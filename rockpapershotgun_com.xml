            <p>Last week, soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> got a patch that rendered a number of its bosses unkillable, seemingly in response to pressure from some Chinese players. For those who aren't keen on the patch's changes, which particularly transforms the challenge you'll face in the game's fourth region, there's now a mod dedicated to undoing them by letting you roll back to a previous version.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth view of the changes patch 1.5 made and what they mean for the game, it's well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">our Jeremy's story</a> on it from last week. The short version is that a number of big foes associated with the Ming dynasty have been made to fall down in exhaustion when you defeat them, rather than being killed. As you might imagine, this has implications not just in terms of the minute-to-minute experience of playing Wuchang, but also the story it tells.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s busted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">next-gen update</a> last year, modders are trying to help players who're keen to roll their game back to a previous version. AVK95 has stepped up to the task with the self-explanatory '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">Rollback censorship patch</a>'.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," its creator wrote in the mod's description. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialog from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p>The mod will take you back to version 1.4 of Wuchang, which meas that in getting rid of patch 1.5's boss tweaks, you'll also be ditching more useful changes like quickened up healing animations and a revamping of how Wuchang gets back up after being knocked down. If you choose to download it, you'll get a file called WuchangRollback.exe, which it instructs you to extract and then run in your game's root folder.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you'll have to disable the game's ability to automatically update by heading into its properties menu via your steam library. Lastly, you'll need to start the game each time by clicking a file called 'Project_Plague-Win64-Shipping', rather than clicking play on Steam itself.</p>
<p>It's a fair amount of palaver to go through, but with Steam lacking a feature like fellow storefront GOG.com's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419630535057-The-rollback-feature-reverting-to-a-previous-version-of-the-game">built-in rollbacks</a> for games that don't offer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/164mwsj/psa_how_to_rollback_to_a_previous_game_version_on/">previous versions as betas</a>, it's probably the best you'll get for now. As you saw with that Fallout update, there can be other ways to pull off rolling back a patch, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ccxyxb/pc_players_here_is_a_guide_on_how_to_rollback/">re-downloading old depot files</a>, but that's usually no walk in the park unless you find some instructions you can follow to the letter.</p>
<p>There might end up being a better solution if someone develops a mod that only gets rid of patch 1.5's controversial changes or, ideally, developers Lenzee opt to offer a version of the game that does the same. As of right now, there's just AVK95's mod, which also doesn't work with the Xbox Game Pass version of Wuchang.</p>

            <p>Hello all! And a very happy This Week to you. I'm back from break just in time for Gamescom. Gamescom! *Broadway overture kicks in* A time of booths and blaggardry! Of queues and carousing! Of flinching away from cosplayers promising Free Hugs! Of getting caught in a human logjam between the major exhibition halls and the lavatories! Of miniature walled villages operated by triple-A publishers, hosting their own local culture of finger food! Of strung-out crypto investors filling the alcoves with their musical cries of "DOGECOIN FOR SALE, DOGECOIN FOR SALE!" Of waifu bodypillows and army recruiters! Of finding the event's secret best game tucked away among the b2b stands! Of long walks back to the hotel across the bridge of locks, wondering how it ever came to this!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Such are my terrible memories, anyway. James is attending the Cologne-based games convention for RPS this year. The rest of us will be stationed atop the Treehouse with telescopes and crossbows, scouring the skies for News with which to feed the exuberant and impetuous Maw. In advance of all that, here's a rundown of new PC games, together with the bare bones of a conference schedule.</p>
<h2>Monday 18th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stick-it-to-the-stickman">Stick It To The Stickman</a> entangles corporate careerism with punching with the golden era of Newgrounds animation. Mark has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stickbossman-i-think-youll-find-my-chainsaw-has-an-appointment">sticking it to the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 19th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> is the latest Journey-me-do from Abzu and The Pathless devs Giant Squid. It's about doing ollies on a claymore. I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-an-enveloping-but-not-cutting-meditation-on-flow-journey-and-vintage-tony-hawk">quite impressed</a> by the SGF demo.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/voidbreaker">Void/Breaker</a> is a glistening goldfish bowl full of robots, destructible buildings and moddable guns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757940/Raygun_Gadabout/">Raygun Gadabout</a> is a retro-future sci-fi with splattery Rick &amp; Morty stylings. Possibly an Earthworm Jim for people who don't like Earthworm Jim since its creator went a bit Wrong.</li>
<li>They do the Geoffs in different voices at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, featuring Blandoman Extraordinaire and his Fashion Friends, plus some videogames. The main show starts at 11am PT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 20th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896760/Azooma_Escape/">Azooma Escape</a> is a comedic stealth adventure about breaking out of an overbearing family gathering, from a Saudi independent team.</li>
<li>Xbox are doing their first Gamescom broadcast today at 6am PT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll share further details of the external inquiry Microsoft have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">recently commissioned</a> into their alleged complicity with war crimes.</li>
<li>The Future Games Show is next up on the Gamescom schedule at 11am PDT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST, and 8pm CEST. We can expect: the voice actors behind Solid Snake and Lady Dimitrescu. Now there's a fanshipping for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 21st August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631450/Bean_Beasts/">Bean Beasts</a> is a lushly pixelled tower defender in which your towers are Pokenots and your traps are upgradeable - truly, these are dark times for tower attackers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is about ushering befuddled goat things up a mountain. It's from them wot did Far: Lone Sail.</li>
<li>It's time for Eggsbogs Gamecome All Ye Faithful round two at 6am PDT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST, and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll have another crack at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">justifying the mass layoffs</a> in this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 22nd August</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let's leave Friday wide open and spotless as the freshly fallen snow, to catch any larger unexpected Gamescom revelations. Maybe somebody will wear another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">politically ill-advised hat</a> on stage. Maybe James will go full gonzo. According to my meeting notes, he's promised to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-know-ill-use-deep-rock-galactic-to-identify-the-mushrooms-in-my-palm-pot">eat all those mushrooms he found in his planters last week</a>. I think that would be a wonderful way to close the expo, personally. I'm sure you'll all remind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Broadway overture crackles and slows into a nightmarish series of undersea noises* Good luck with the Geoffalypse, all.</p>
