            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, one of the infinite number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor studios that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">cropped up last year</a>, have been mostly quiet on whatever it is they've been cooking up since forming. They announced their existence with an evocative political manifesto, and today they revealed what's next. No, it's not a video game, but something a lot more physical, tangible, and interestingly old fashioned: a book.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply titled <a href="https://summereternal.com/anthology">Summer Eternal Anthology</a>, it's actually volume one of that planned anthology, which does run on the assumption that they manage to release another one. A press release from Summer Eternal describes it as "part cultural journal, part expedition log, part development diary," and, most unusually of all, "part physical game announcement."
</p>

This incendiary tome is part cultural journal, part development diary, part exclusive game reveal. Built by firestarters, for firestarters.

With the internet being the de facto place you announce a videogame these days, Summer Eternal are certainly doing something different here, more akin to magazine exclusives from days of yore. It's a bold move, and one they're hoping will support them financially, for this book is both an announcement teaser and a source of income in itself. There'll apparently be info on gameplay systems, the game's world, and how it all looks. Oh, and the game has a codename too, "Red Rooster."
</p><p>
Aside from that, you'll also find a few non-fiction essays, interviews, political thinkpieces related to the games industry, and a recap of what Summer Eternal have gone through to establish a worker-owned co-op. You'll have to wait a while for it though, as it's planned for spring 2026 earliest, summer 2026 latest.
</p>
<p>
In case you need a bit of a refresher on Summer Eternal as a studio compared to the other teams that boast of having former Disco devs on the books, this is the one co-founded by Argo Tuulik and Dora Klindžić, both former writers at ZA/UM. You may remember that Tuulik and Klindžić have had some legal back-and-forth with Riaz Moola, founder and owner of Longdue, a different supposed Disco successor.
</p>
<p>
Moola alleges that the pair violated a non-compete clause after they were previously employed by him, whereas Tuulik and Klindžić claim that this particular clause covered a separate industry. People Make Games <a href="https://youtu.be/lZEAs6M1wts?si=enfye4e3OBsazepP">explored some of this particular legal battle</a> in a follow-up to their <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M?si=HafzykdWTFtfRgmb">original Disco Elysium/ ZA/UM documentary from 2023</a>, if you want a bit more depth.

Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you surround it with gunky visual metaphors for indentured servitude? Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you balance all the medulla-massaging twinkles and jingles against some gloating indications that the apparatus means you harm - drawerfuls of pink, polygonal flesh; shivery text that seems to crawl away from your eyes; a first-person camera that appears to be constantly hyperventilating; a trapdoor right beneath your feet? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">the Steam page disclaimer</a> that "CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!" Is a slot machine still a slot machine when it's a "sinister tale of addiction and escape" that also dangles the more-ish prospect of replay with different seeds or modifiers? Is a slot machine nothing more than a slot machine when it challenges you to "push your score to new heights in Endless Mode"?
</p>
<p>
Based on 20 minutes with CloverPit, I think the answer to all these questions is "no". I don't think CloverPit is a slot machine, even though it aims to be Endless, and I don't want to get it bluntly recategorised as an 18-rated experience or even removed from stores, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-junking-balatros-18-rating-pegi-will-develop-a-more-granular-rating-system-for-gambling-themes">as was the case with Balatro last year</a>. Still, I'm starting to find these ironic/satirical gambling simulators a bit, well, <em>too</em> cynical, in that I think we are perhaps trying to have our cynicism and eat it, just a smidge.
</p>
<p>
CloverPit released late last week, and there's still a demo on Steam. The basics of the game are that you're both gambling to pay off an ever-increasing debt, and slowly levelling up and optimising a slot machine by spending tokens - increasing the odds of certain symbols appearing, or how much they score, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Fail to keep up with your debts, and whoops, there goes the trapdoor. The play environment has some fun widgets: you can remind yourself of the modifiers in play by conversing with a horrible toy phone on wheels. I'm quite interested in how they've found the balance between enticing and unpleasant in the design of those chunkily retro, blood-spattered visual props.
</p><p>
There are a lot of roguelikes with nudge-wink casino themes, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck be a Landlord</a> through the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a> and various gamble-nots on Itch.io that haven't quite broken through the crust. At a glance, many have the same rough punchline: living under capitalism is a gaudy grind for a fleeting pittance beset by chronic indignity and unfairness, so why not laugh at your own helplessness. Why not revel in it?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can defeat the system from inside, but even if you can't, there's some catharsis to derive from seeing the system for what it is. Also, yanking the wrist of a one-arm bandit is Fun - even "addictive", in the words of one of CloverPit's professional reviews, but you know, addictive with a knowing smirk. Addictive in an above-it-all way.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I myself am nudging and winking towards is a proper longform accounting of comically gambling-adjacent roguelikes that queries them for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">signs of more obvious hypocrisy</a>, and perhaps chucks in some analysis of the inherently gamblery nature of the roguelite at large - a genre predicated upon but not reducible to randomisation and repetition. You'd have to weave in some thoughts about habit-forming elements in non-roguelite games - lootboxes, level-up noises, that kind of stuff. You'd have to talk about learned helplessness and defeatism as they are potentially manifest in entertainment works.</p>
<p>Ugh, now that I've smooshed together an outline, I don't want to write this, not least because I think I had much the same ideas five years ago, and either didn't follow through or wrote them up and forgot. I am spinning my wheels. Anyway, you might want to try CloverPit's demo, or watch a streamer try their luck. It's been doing well on the Steamvine - partly, I suspect, because it's solid reaction-video fare. Horror games tend to be a good fit for streamers. Still, I think I'm going to go back to playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, for the minute.
