Fancy a jaunt back into The Zone? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> released the long awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> last November, steadling improving it after an (understandably) rocky launch. There's been several hefty updates for the sequel released along the way, and it turns out the developer has been even busier than expected. GSC Game World announced Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition today, a revamp of the original three games, Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, that mostly brings in some visual upgrades.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on an <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">FAQ</a> about the update, GSC explained that these improvements include things like enhancements to GodRays and the overall lighting system, refined surface reflections, improved 3D models for NPCs and guns, and even things like updated skyboxes. Textures have seen some upscaling too, and some aspects of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> UI has been updated to "improve usability" on both PC and console.

While they didn't specify what, there have been some tweaks to the controls to make them "more in line with current game practices" and there's some new quality of life features too, whatever they are. Full controller support is being added, and Steam Deck users will probably be happy to hear all three games have been optimised for the handheld. And there'll be cloud saves now too!
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it certainly all looks newer. I never feel particularly passionate about lighting "upgrades" like this, the vibes often feel just a little bit too different. Mostly I miss the days when games didn't have real-time lighting, a lot of games just kind of look the same now. Ah well, at least the base of it is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
This new update is coming May 20th, just a few days away, and for some added good news, this'll be a free update. The revamped version of the individual games will be listed separately in your library, so if you're averse to the modern world, you'll still be able to play as normal. Happy zoning!

There's a newish Persona game on the way next month, and it is, of course, yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5</a> spinoff. I'm not sure if another cow in existence has been so thoroughly milked before, but here we are. I call <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: The Phantom X (that's its name, by the way) newish because it's actually been available in China through an ongoing open beta for the last year. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> held a pre-recorded livestream confirming that the mobile game is finally coming westward, and that it'll be getting a PC release as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, despite being Persona 5 by name and aesthetic, it'll be offering up some fresh characters for once. You're still the Phantom Thieves, just a different bunch - the protagonist in this one is called Wonder, and the animal companion is an owl-looking critter.

<a aria-label="P5X News -First announcement!

<p>
Much like in the original, during the day you'll hang out with friends and study, and at night you'll venture out into dungeons. Apparently you will be able to meet Joker and other characters from the almost decade-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> (see what I mean about milking that cow) as part of special contracts. You'll apparently also find PvE elements called Velvet trials, alongside mini-games and the ability to make and join guilds.
</p>
<p>
It's definitely worth mentioning that this very much does seem to be Atlus' (very late) response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, as it is a free-to-play gacha game. Not ideal, particularly for those that find it difficult to play gacha games, but I'm sure Atlus will figure out how they can make yet another spinoff at some point.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's June 26th, a little over a month away, meaning you could probably fit in a Persona 5 replay as long as you just don't eat or sleep at all until then.
