            <p>A group of tinkerers working on reviving Bioware's Anthem via private servers following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">shutdown</a> earlier this month have now offered more insight into how that project's going so far. While a video <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">posted last week</a> got hopes up that a return could be relatively imminient, the group say there's plenty of work to be done yet, with the main potential stubling block being efforts to figure out the quirks of EA's Frostbite engine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This group working on trying to get Anthem back online with private servers, likely in a similar fashion to the fan-revived version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">released last year</a>, have chatted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/">Ars Technica</a> about the current progress. The short version is that while last week's video of a basic private server setup running was a milestone, this group working out of a Discord server called The Fort’s Forge still face a big hurdle that they reckon'll dicate how the project plays out.</p>
<p>According to a team member with the handle Ness199X, the group have so far managed to break the services that make Anthem tick into three parts. There's EA’s Blaze server to handle basic player authentication, a web server called Bioware Online Services which tracks things like inventories and quest progression, and finally the Frostbite multiplayer engine which handles loading levels and tracking players in them. The video showed off "quick and dirty" efforts to emulate the first two.</p>
<p>How to handle getting the Frostbite element and its level data to work in fashion that doesn't rely on the servers EA have shut down is something the group are "exploring", but say has been complicated by Anthem sometimes behaving in quirky ways that are different to other Frostbite games. "For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do," Ness199X explained. "And we have yet to determine why." They reckon the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature" might be part of this, but at this point aren't "entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to."</p><p>As a result of that uncertainty, whether the group will be able to pull on all the Frostbite threads they'd ideally want to for a revived Anthem and how long that'll take remain up in the air. Ness199X said they're currently about 75% sure that'll be doable, and it'll dictate whether reviving the game takes "months, or less even, depending on motivation" or ends up with "the amount of work increases fairly exponentially" to the point the group might not be motivated to slog through it.</p>
<p>Either way, the group are still keen to emphasise that it's early days yet, so not to expect they'll definitely have more progress to show off or put out in short order.</p>

            <p>Do you miss the good old days of Diablo, before Blizzard’s hellish clickfest megamorphed into a live service Beezelbub owned and operated by stinky uncle Microsoft? Be upstanding, perhaps, for Darkhaven – a new action RPG from a studio founded by a trio of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 veterans, who have some questionable notions about weaponising volcanos.</p>
<p>Said veterans are Diablo 2 lead character artist Philip Shenk, Diablo 2 programmer/designer/lead Peter Hu, and the original Diablo’s senior designer, art director, and story writer Erich Schaefer. So, <em>actual</em> veterans then, rather than people who sneezed in the presence of some Sanctuary concept art while delivering pizza to Blizzard North, back in the 90s.</p><!--more-->

<p>Darkhaven is an isometric (whatever that currently means) dark fantasy affair set in a world of fallen empires, overgrown ruins, and supernatural predators. Some kind of terrible evil is on the up and up, and it’s your job as Chosen One (or Chosen Several, if you’re playing co-op) to bop it on the hooter.</p>
<p>If Darkhaven is channelling the auld Blizzard North energy, it also sounds somewhat like a 4am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> playthrough, in that the world is chaotic and modifiable. </p>
<p>“Designed for solo play, cooperative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms, Darkhaven is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world,” explains a press release. “Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.”</p>
<p>As Shenk summarises in the press release, “we’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create.” </p>
<p>It doesn’t sound like it’ll hinge quite as heavily on gear quality and progression as classique Diablo, either, let alone the wildly incontinent loot walrus that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a>. Characters will be able to “jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre”, with victory in combat “not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness”.</p>

<p>“It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore,” Schaefer comments in the press release. “It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.”</p><p>There is plenty of gear to acquire, but they’re apparently rejecting the “incrementalism” of certain modern ARPGs in favour of “bold, expressive loot – items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them”, as the press release continues. Hu comments that “finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p>
<p>All of which is very much speaking my language, as a serial incremental loot hater, with the caveat that they’re funding it via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds">Kickstarter</a>, ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">a Steam early access release</a>. I am newly suspicious of crowd-funding, in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enormously-disappointing-darkest-dungeons-boardgame-port-is-dead-but-red-hook-are-giving-away-game-files-to-backers">the Darkest Dungeon boardgame bullshit</a>. Still, as Diablo successors go, this one has more of a pedigree than most.</p>
