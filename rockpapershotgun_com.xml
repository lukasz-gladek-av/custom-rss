Anyone fancy taking a journey across space? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/daedalic-reveal-story-driven-star-trek-voyager-strategy-game-in-which-you-can-betray-everything-janeway-ever-stood-for">Last month</a>, Daedalic Entertainment announced it is publishing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" from developer gameXcite. It was only a quick reveal though, so I'm sure they were quite Xcited to reveal a first look at gameplay in a trailer earlier today.
</p>
<p>
As you can probably gather, this is an adaptation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>: Voyager specifically, but the whole big thing isn't just a strategy game laid over the top of the show's main plot beats, it's being able to enact "what if?" type scenarios. How this manifests in gameplay terms looks quite involved. For starters, there's the ship management. This looks quite a lot like Fallout: Shelter, where you have a whole bunch of different blocks that you can build different types of rooms in for your crew to go about their business in.

Then you've got your space combat, which is a bit harder to take stock of from the trailer. It looks like you'll have different abilities you can use to fend off baddies, with a cooldown stopping you from spamming them. I think you may also have to keep an eye on specific parts of your ship from getting too damaged, but I can't quite tell exactly truth be told, it's only a short bit of the trailer.
</p><p>
Aside from that, you can also use different members of your crew to solve specific missions, and you'll have to make sure you choose the right members to do so as they all have their own pros and cons. And then there's some very '90s FMV looking bits where you can choose alternate story paths from what looks to be classic episodes (I don't know, I'm not a Trekkie, feel free to shout at me if none of them look particularly classic).
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">here</a>.
