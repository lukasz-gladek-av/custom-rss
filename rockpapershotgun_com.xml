            <p>Still fresh off of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">bought from Riot</a> and revived by a team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> now has an early access release date. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox emerges from the cave it's spent years exploring early next year, with pre-orders kicking off next month.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">dates</a> you'll want to circle on your calendar are January 13th, 2026, and December 13th, 2025. Yep, it seems that isn't an unlucky number in Hypixel's estimation. The first of those dates will see Hytale release in what Collins-Laflamme and co are being clear is "true early access", while the latter sees pre-orders go live at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">prices Hypixel have previously outlined</a>. So, about $20/equivalent for the base version.</p>
<p>"It’s still very much unfinished and broken, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1994430319580098783">wrote</a> of the Hytale you'll be getting if you dive in at this point. "The game isn't good yet; eventually, it will be. If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in Early Access, please don’t."</p>
<p>He added that while the decision to go back to an older build means "some parts of the game will feel behind", the now 50-strong team working on the project have momentum behind them. "Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term," the dev explained. "That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day 1. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early."</p>
<p>In summary, Collins-Laflamme declared that "the first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more" and promised more details about the release will be incoming.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of what Hytale's like at the moment, the group now helming it were quick to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">show off some footage of the game in action</a> after it was mailed over by Riot.</p>

If you've been struggling lately with the thought that everybody you interact with online is a closet serial killer, why not fire up Killer Chat, which will remove all uncertainty from your brain and flood it with delicious, sexy fear. Hitherto available on <a href="https://rosesrot.itch.io/killer-chat">Itch.io</a>, and just released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476730/Killer_Chat__Original_Edition/">Steam</a>, it casts you as a reporter researching a book on serial killers. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If it were me, I'd be watching Manhunter, but no, this reporter is the kind of snoop who accidentally joins a chatroom on the darkweb while googling "how to make ribcages decompose fast", and immediately gets cosy with users called "goreboy". You've got to pass yourself off as an embryonic Hannibal Lecter, as much for the sake of survival as to gather info for your book. And while you're getting to know this crowd, you might as well fuck a few of them. Yeah, that should pan out well. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Over the course of six in-game months, you'll rub shoulders with various extremely pretty anime murderers, catching up with them over text or videocall in a dating sim format. There are eight endings that presumably range from your character waking up dead through you calling the police to you becoming a killer yourself. Each route to the finish should take 2-3 hours. All told, you can expect 9-12 hours of slayer-slaying if you're committed to the cause. 
</p><p>
All this need cost you nothing, save the possibility of some worrying revelations about your own kinks. The base "Original" Steam edition of the game is free, having previously been crowd-funded. There are also various DLC packs and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378100/Killer_Chat__Expanded_Edition/">a forthcoming expanded edition</a> that will offer at least double the words, with over 20 possible endings. I am picturing those words scribbled all over the walls of a dingy apartment full of pickle jars. "Just his mind poured on paper," breathes an anime version of Morgan Freeman, before blowing you a kiss.
