<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, as of today, as temporally upsetting as it is to write this, is officially 10 years old. An entire decade! A far cry from being able to vote, but in the UK it could be convicted of a criminal offence, if such a situation were to arise. And to commemorate such an occasion, creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone shared a 22 minute long video showing some old builds of the game, shared some behind the scenes and tidbits, and revealed the new marriage candidates coming in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> sims' 1.7 update.
</p>
<p>
One is Sandy, a villager who lives out in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/calico">Calico</a> Desert running a store called the Oasis. This is fine! Nothing to complain about here, I rarely think of Sandy when I think of Stardew Valley, but surely there is one person in this world who will be happy to explore such a relationship.In a complete 180 of such a possibility, the other person you can shack up with is Clint. Clint! The same Clint that is universally thought of as a bit of a creepy and most would sooner ignore, if not for the fact that he's the local blacksmith.

<p>
Now, I most certainly will judge you for going through with such a proposal, however, what supersedes this is the fact that out of everyone, this is absolutely the funniest possible choice. A trick and a treat all in one! And that is something I can abide by, even if I can't do the same with Clint himself. 
</p><p>
In any case, while this is arguably the headline, because we're all too deep in the trenches for anything else generally, the full video is worth a watch itself. Barone kicked things off with a look at Sprout Valley, the very first iteration of what we now know as Stardew Valley. It does of course look incredibly different, and yet what strikes is how little mechanically, locatively, and even spiritually changed. The game is there! Just rougher, uglier, perhaps even a bit less confident, but it's there. A neat insight into the development of the reason as to why every other game is a farming sim now.

            <p>
When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>, with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> creators and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-highguards-website-goes-dark-a-report-emerges-that-the-not-so-indie-shooter-was-funded-by-tencent">reported Tencent funding</a>, comes out and just kind of flops, you have to wonder what happened to get it to this point. Well, a new report from Mr. Scoop himself Jason Schreier over at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> appears to have shed a bit of light on the whole palaver through speaking with former Wildlight staffers. 
</p>
<p>
The story goes way back to 2021, when several devs working at Respawn decided to quit to start their own studio, partially for some creative freedom, but with this new report also claiming that part of the reason was simply about money. Specifically, Apex Legends made a whole bunch of it, and its makers felt they weren't getting an even share, so intended for their new studio to include a profit-sharing program, which is part of what helped to bring in several other Respawn staffers.
</p>
<p>
Apparently around two years into development, Wildlight knew that their game wasn't working and was too big in scope, so in January 2024 they began to refine it into what ultimately came to be. There were apparent hopes to develop single-player stories set within the same world, with Highguard serving as a starting point for expansion further down the line.
</p>
<p>
When it came to testing, it was quickly found that the game was only really fun with mics on, and Wildlight staffers said it was a much worse experience without voice chat. Members of the team did apparently suggest conducting tests from the game to start building a community, but management would always shoot this down, hoping to recreate the same success they found with Apex Legends, i.e. keeping it a secret and launching it right after announcing it. 
</p><p>
It's worth noting that the devs at Wildlight felt positive about working at the studio, until the last couple of months around launch, where morale struggled and many started to question the choice for the surprise launch. This launch ultimately didn't work, despite a pretty strong start, but despite the struggle staff believed there was enough money to allow them to keep working on the game to address any issues. But in mid-February, staff were told there wasn't any money, with many believing that the financial support from funders was based on hitting particular metrics the game had failed to meet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">ultimately resulting in layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
A number of former staffers apparently pinned the game's more-or-less failure on the "hubris" of leadership believing they could repeat the success they found with Apex Legends. Now, apparently less than 20 devs are continuing to work on Highguard at Wildlight, with a new mode having arrived <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613785064243442?l=english">just today</a>. In the world of live service, however, 20 people does not seem like enough to keep a game like this going for particularly long. Good luck to those out of work, and those still in it.
