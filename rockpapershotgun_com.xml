            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>

<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>

<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>
