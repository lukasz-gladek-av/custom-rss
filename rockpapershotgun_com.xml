            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> publishers HoYoverse are suing a player for $150,000 over a pre-release stream of a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a> character.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse">reported</a> by Nicole Carpenter over on the Gamefile newsletter (paywall), the Singapore-based publishers are taking one Alfredo Lopez to court after he broadcast an early look at Castorice, a melancholy floral dragon summoner, to a Discord channel with around 12,000 members. The lawsuit was filed on June 6th in the United States District Court's Central District of California.</p>
<p>According to HoYoverse's copyright claim, Lopez has "unfairly or unlawfully obtained a game update before its release date", but the suit appears more vexed by Lopez sharing footage of the character, than how he obtained the game build in question. </p>
<p>They argue that a leak such as this "dampens the excitement and anticipation that many players feel when they obtain the update legitimately upon its official release." It's worth noting that Castorice had already been revealed as an upcoming addition to the game - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-honkai-star-rail-amphoreus-trailer-featuring-castorice-revealed-the-game-awards-2024">during last December's Game Awards, no less</a>. </p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a live service gacha game, with around 70 characters at the time of writing. Jason Coles thought it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/honkai-star-rail-review">good fun</a> back in April 2023. I can see how the publisher of a game which thrives on the lure of randomly served or microtransacted anime fancy-dans might be extra prickly about having the goods screened ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on billion-dollar publishers suing Discord streamers into the scorched earth over footage of a character we already know about.</p>
<p>As Carpenter comments in the newsletter, HoYoverse have proven <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-43885b83-8690-4687-9574-a8029abd586f.html?stream=top">pretty militant about going after leakers in the past</a>, though they're hardly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-sue-over-fortnite-superhero-leak">alone in this</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I find Fortnite's desperation to be the everything game both fascinating and overwhelming. There's always something new for you to do around the corner, some new game mode that's attempting to tap into current trends of whatever it is that kids are into at any given moment. Currently, on the younger audience side of things with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Epic Games are launching Expeditions, a new wave-based mode that looks like a bit of a blend between a hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be honest, the framing of the whole thing is very much not for me, because I am not a child. A place called the Supernova Academy acts as your base before you head out on PvE missions all in the hopes of stopping "the evil Mask Maker Daigo from destroying the world". It's as generic a setup as can be, which I feel is a shame because kids do deserve quality storytelling, something which Fortnite itself isn't awful at (I don't love the FOMO nature of its events, but it's certainly Doing Something at the very least).

Missions see you facing down hordes of enemies as is typical of the wave-based format, there's a map to explore with Lego people to rescue and resources, money, and gear to gather up. You also have different hero classes to choose from, like one that can fly around to get a lay of the land, another can use rifts and summon crystals to deal damage to a bunch of enemies, you get how this all works.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing very much feels like it was made for kids who think the big boy shooters their siblings or teenagers are playing online look really cool, but obviously are far from old enough to play. This is a Fortnite mode though, as cynical as I might feel about this thing, I'm sure it'll do well enough.

<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions is launching tomorrow, June 18th.

            <p>"Factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>-style pixel physics" is a pitch even more calculated to make me flee screaming than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cave-diver-blends-the-joyful-physics-of-qwop-with-the-less-joyful-physics-of-being-trapped-underground">"game in which you die in very small caves"</a>, but I'm writing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sandustry">Sandustry</a> anyway, because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> came out this month, and as such, all sand-based games gain +20 press appeal.</p>
<p>We've covered the game before, with Ollie selecting the demo for one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">Steam Next Fest round-ups</a>. Today's news is that Hooded Horse, fans of moderately weird strategy games, have signed on to publish the thing, much to solo developer Lantto's delight. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Sandustry lets you loose upon the surface of a procedurally generated world, in which every pixel "is a resource waiting to be mined, mixed, processed, or destroyed". Expect "countless chemical and physical reactions" as you assemble a planet-gobbling logistics network from conveyor belts, pipes, pumps and elevators. It's absolute chaos, from the sound of things. I already suck at building symmetrical production lines in games that <em>don't</em> simulate things like water turning into steam, which then returns to the earth as rain. Don't even get me started about the prospect of self-combusting slagpiles. Naughty slagpiles! Enough of that now.</p>
<p>Volatile terrain materials aside, you've also got to worry about ancient threats lurking deep beneath the crust. This is problematic, because those forbidden depths also harbour new technologies for your factories. This being such a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-ass piece of work, I imagine one solution would be to painstakingly dig a channel from the surface and fill the depths with factory byproducts, thus incinerating two birds with one deluge of white-hot slag. But it also looks like you can just head down there with a rocket launcher and take care of business in person.</p>
<p>"Partnering with a publisher means I can finally focus 100% on making the game without worrying about all the indirect tasks that currently eat up a lot of time," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2764460/view/525345073881155519?l=english">enthuses</a> the developer on Steam. "I'll retain full creative freedom while having a team to support me with everything else. I can't think of a better home for Sandustry, and I'm stoked to start revealing future plans for the game, including details on playtests and release dates."</p>
<p>You love to see it. That demo is still live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764460/Sandustry/">Steam</a>, if you fancy giving it a go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
