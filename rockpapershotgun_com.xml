            <p>Look, EA and Maxis, did you really have to do this? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s virtual humans, who've long been able to take solace in the fact that random virtual people in the street couldn't see absolutely everything their despotic overlords force them to do indoors, no longer have that privilege. The game's latest update has made glass walls for houses a thing.</p>
<p>You can also stick plants on roofs, to give your prisoners something nice to stare at through their transparent cells when you inevitably delete all of the doors and watch them die. Yep, I know the myriad crimes that've been perpetrated with pool stairs over the years, and this looks like it'll start a terrifying new chapter for sim cruelty.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-ep19bgu-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=84574&amp;ts=1751455982007">the notes</a> for the update - which lays some groundwork for a paid expansion pack that's set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-enchanted-by-nature-looks-perfect-for-cottagecore-lovers-on-tiktok-circa-2020">make fairy sims a thing</a> on July 10th - EA show these new glass walls being used to build a cosy greehouse. You can find them under the misc heading of the wall patterns section in build mode. How nice.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's only taken a look at Reddit less than 24 hours after the update went live for me to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lpfl1c/took_advantage_of_the_new_update/">a glass prison cell</a> someone's stuck a sim in. It's ok, they were just doing a one-off build inspired by the glass box <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a43215821/you-season-4-joe-goldberg-glass-cage/">from that Netflix serial killer series</a>. I'm sure no sims are about to be trapped in doorless see-through cages en-masse.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sims players have been pulling tricks with windows to create walls that are pretty much transparent for a while now, but you didn't have to cut out the middlemessing, EA. Our species invented opaque walls for a reason. I know, natural light and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the update also introduces the ability to stick certain plants on the roofs of houses, because when you pop down the garden centre and buy some hydrangeas, you definitely want to stick them somewhere that means watering'll require some chimney climbing or a big ladder. Other changes it brings include the introduction of a special inventory section where food'll be moved once it goes off, so you can definitely not make a point of feeding your sim it anyway and maniacally cackling at the consequences.</p>
<p>Alongside a wider inventory overhaul are updates to the game's notebook and household collections designed to make those menus easier to navigate, plus a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now go, and close the glass door to the glass office I definitely don't regret installing in my real life house on the way out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-sims-4-update-adds-glass-walls-and-i-hope-your-virtual-humans-throw-stones-at-you-from-their-see-through-prisons]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Out now for testing on Bedrock, with Java to follow</p>

            <p>Copper golems and new types of copper equipment are coming in the next big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> update, which is available to test now in Minecraft Bedrock and available shortly as a Snapshot for the Java edition. The golems actually date back to Minecraft's 2021 Mob Vote - players cruelly snubbed them in favour of the musical, item-fetching Allay. Classic case of robophobia, if you ask me. What can some fairy jukebox junkie do that a golem can't. Luckily for you nay-sayers, Mojang have seen fit to add the oxidisable automatons to Minecraft anyway, in keeping with the idea that Mob Vote outcomes are more of a guide for development than a rigid prescription.</p><!--more-->
<p>As and when you get access to the update, you'll build golems by planting a jack-o-lantern or carved pumpkin atop a block of copper. This, to my understanding, is how the good Lord created Adam in the Garden of Eden, except that Adam did not immediately start going through the Good Lord's treasure chests within a set range and organising them by item.</p>
<p>A copper golem is, in other words, a housekeeper. It'll ensure that each goodie you craft is stored in the same place. I look forward to the complaints from players who've had to start over because all of their diamond equipment has been industriously shuffled into some random cellar. I also like the idea of these worlds outlasting their creators and becoming a ceaseless hive of Mary Poppinbots. As with other copper items in Mojang's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, the golems will corrode over time and develop a charming green patina, though this doesn't affect their operation.</p>
<p>Copper in general will be more useful as of this updating. It's now an equipment tier, whose "durability sits somewhere between stone and iron", according to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-new-friend-with-a-familiar-patina">the official Minecraft website</a>. Apparently, "a copper pickaxe will help you mine a bit faster and for a bit longer than a stone pickaxe but won't allow you to mine any additional materials - you'll still need to upgrade to iron for that." Being already abundant in Minecraft's generated worlds, it's "the perfect early-game material".</p>
<p>In case you have been skulking in a Creeper hole these past 10 years and missed the acquisition, Mojang and Minecraft are currently owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are about to announce another round of mass layoffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lstr3pbp3k2x">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. If this does come to pass, the irony of it accompanying the addition of a new robot workforce to Minecraft will be <em>just</em> pressing enough to retrospectively justify me mentioning it here. Fingers crossed that Schreier is wrong.</p><hr>
