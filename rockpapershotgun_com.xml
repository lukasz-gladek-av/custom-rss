            <p>
NaissancE developers Limasse Five have released a big update for SenS, their early access open world spelunking game in which you search an enveloping Structure for Unique Places, tools and artefacts. The ExistencE of SenS is news to me, despite it being very much my cup of ImpossiblE ArchitecturE. 
</p>
<p>
Launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966170/SenS">Steam</a> in 2022, it’s a work of torqued cuboids, sunken pockets of city, and vaguely fractal fissures. While there are no living or active threats, as far as I can tell, you do have to worry about traps and Unstable Zones - “simple or even abstract architectural structures at the beginning, but getting more complex, vast and labyrinthine the further you go.” Unstable Zones change in the dark. So you’ll need to use Luces - glowballs - and other tools to solidify paths and access points.

The Unique Places, meanwhile, are “strange and beautiful” portals to other parts of the Structure. Some harbour objects you can decorate your starting home environment with. Others contain tools such as “bags to carry more stuff, tools, candles, lanterns and gas, lamps and electric cables, ropes to climb [and] ladders”, plus objects that give you new “capacities”.
</p><p>
SenS is "the evolved vision of the Naissance project" lead developer Mavros Sedeño writes on Steam. It’s certainly not hard to trace the throughline from NaissanceE, though this appears to be a much larger gameworld. The developer’s cited influences may not surprise you either, if you’re a seasoned blunderer of the Backrooms – Blame! mangaka Tsutomo Nihei, Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and Foundation SCP. 
</p>
<p>
The new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1966170/view/515231646168909598?l=english">released earlier this month</a>, follows a long break in development. It makes it “possible to experience some layers of the exploration gameplay”, including “a few unique safe places hidden inside the Unstable Zone”. Sedeño cautions that the game’s systems are still at the prototype stage, and that you can expect a few bugs. It sounds like the bugs will be perfectly at home in these cosmic dungeons.
</p>
<p>Sedeño hopes to offer more regular updates in future, which "should be easy considering the last update was over a year ago". He already has some new Unique Places to add, but it "takes time to build an interesting level design to reach those, as well as coding and debugging new features to improve the gameplay up to what I have in mind".</p>
<p>He would also "love to improve the visual quality on the level art, effects, sounds and music, but it's also very time consuming and I prioritize the work on the overall game experience, [leaving] the game art in unfinished state for now." I'd say the game art is pretty eye-grabbing as it stands.</p><p>
SenS is clearly a long way from done, but if you’re convinced, it’s 20% off till 4th February. I adored NaissanceE’s space and architecture, though I agree with Jim Rossignol’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naissance-review-pc">withering assessment</a> of certain jump puzzles. I look forward to getting lost in this new cathedral of godflesh.

            <p>Team Fortress 2 Classified is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3545060/Team_Fortress_2_Classified/">out now on Steam</a>, the mod having finally earned Valve’s blessing after a bit of a tizzy with its former name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-mod-classic-is-now-classified-literally-and-gets-a-short-delay-into-2026">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>. That makes it an easy one-click job to install, assuming you have the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">TF2</a> installed, and it’s a fine piece of modding work in general: inspired by the shooter’s past without being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">beholden to nostalgia</a>, while expanding itself with restored modes and weapons that Valve left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>Wisely, Team Fortress 2 Classified doesn’t drag itself all the way back to TF2’s very earliest days, where sticky bombs could explode through doors and glitched-out Engineers could build sentry guns in the sky. It is a simplified game in some ways, its lack of comedy cosmetics a proud selling point, but it keeps most of Valve’s best balance tweaks (Pyro airblast, movable Engie buildings, fewer bullshit pipe bombs for the Demo), Thus, it never feels like an stubborn old man of a mod, refusing to get with the times.</p>
<p>Its own additions are thoughtfully worked in, too. VIP mode, in which one team escorts a waddling businessman while the other attempts to give him the Archduke Franz Ferdinand treatment, was ditched by Valve on account of it essentially spoiling one player’s – the VIP's – round by making them a defenceless civvy. In TF2 Classified, they’ve become more of an active support class, defensively buffing nearby teammates and occasionally powering up his bodyguards with a spell of mini-crits. The mode still plays out broadly like Payload, Valve’s bomb-pushing official replacement, but the 'It sucks being VIP' problem is solved; he’s the one teammate everyone wants to hang out with.</p>
<p>I’m less sold on some of the guns. The Scout’s nailgun, for instance, behaves almost indistinguishably from the Medic’s default syringe gun, and denies the little Bostonian nitwit the timelessly high risk/high reward Scout play of ploughing through someone with two point-blank Scattergun blasts. The Soldier, meanwhile, gets a weird arc-firing rocket launcher alt whose single shot makes playing Solly even more of an exercise in reloading. All the base game defaults are here, though, and sticking to them is no bad time. If anything, they reminded me of how lightning-in-a-bottle good TF2’s class loadouts are: for all the sidegrades and alternatives Valve have poured into it over the years, the original tools have always stayed viable and reliable.</p>

<p>Team Fortress 2 Classified understands that, and shows that knowing what <em>not</em> to touch is an important to a great mod as knowing what to change. I’ll definitely be playing more of it, and I may even be willing to overlook its one serious offence: in entirely removing custom cosmetics, the mod makes it impossible to wear <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Horace">the Horace hat</a>. Pshaw! Be sure to express your own disapproval of this wanton act of endless bear prejudice (and claim your own wearable Horace) by joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subscribe">RPS Premium Supporters programme</a> for the low, low price of £5.99 per month. While stocks last, which because they are pixels, is forever.</p>
