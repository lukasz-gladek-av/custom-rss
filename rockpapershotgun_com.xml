I don't think you can more easily sell me on a game than by saying it was made by one of the artists behind Celeste, and has music from Disasterpeace, i.e. the composer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, and It Follows. But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a> is, a horror RPG in the vein of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/neverway-is-a-horror-rpg-stardew-valley-from-one-of-the-artists-behind-celeste">first announced back in April</a>, back with a nice little look-in at yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pedro Medeiros, the Celeste artist in question, and programmer/ writer Isadora Sophia gave a great little rundown of Neverway, explaining that you play as Fiona, a character who much like the player character in Stardew has just quit her dead end job. She's trying to start over on a farm, live the quiet life, except she ends up having to serve as a herald for a dead god because of some debt she owes. Awkward!

<p>
That kind of life does end up leading towards the need to fight in a classic Zelda-ish 2D action combat kind of way, but you do have to balance all of that adventuring with your regular life too. That means farming, paying your mortgage, making friends, maybe even falling in love. Those bonds can lead to new combat abilities too, something I wish my own relationships offered me. 
</p>
<p>
Time works a bit differently in Neverway too, as rather than the day slowly tick tocking away, it moves from morning, to afternoon, to night when you do things like eat, sleep, or read a manual of some sort.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you'll end up searching for the titular Neverway, a "decaying nightmarish reality that is slowly leaking into yours." This is where you'll learn about the game's post-apocalyptic world as you pay off your debt.
</p>
<p>
I know "farming sim but dark" isn't exactly a new concept, it's just that Neverway is doing so with such eyecatching style I can't help but be won over by it. It looks like there's a real sincerity to the life-sim elements as opposed to them just being slapped into some dark themes. That's the ticket to my heart honestly, a good bit of earnestness goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
Neverway doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

A. Corey novels and Syfy TV adaptations. It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics. Also, crew romances. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Explore a Divided Solar System: Travel across iconic locations from the TV show and books, like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. While traversing the various environments, players must uncover secrets and influence outcomes through their skills and decisions.</p>
<p>A Story-Driven RPG True to The Expanse: Immerse yourself in a narrative grounded in tension, consequence, and the complexity of humanity's future among the stars</p></blockquote>
<p>Osiris Reborn is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727390/The_Expanse_Osiris_Reborn/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-736f65">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_expanse_osiris_reborn">GOG</a> at a date that is not today, nor tomorrow, but "soon".</p>
<p>The developers are at pains to reassure that they've got a whole new team working on the thing and that there is no overlap with any of Owlcat's other projects, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-is-the-next-tactical-and-bloody-crpg-from-the-devs-behind-rogue-trader">the recently revealed Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>. They're collaborating on the game with Alcon Interactive Group, publishers of The Expanse: A Telltale Story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a>? That was a bloody lovely game. I'm always partial to a game where photography is the core mechanic, there's such a specific joy in navigating a space attempting to capture a fracture of its essence. Photo modes just aren't the same, I want someone to textually give me a camera and send me on my way. A sequel was announced last year, quite simply called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem-2">Toem 2</a>, and during yesterday's Day of the Devs, some gameplay was shown off for the first time.

Essentially, it looks like more of the same (which I want to quickly make clear is a wonderful thing), albeit clearly with a few more years of artistic experience under the developers' belts. Environments are fully 3D now, rather than what (I'm guessing) were all 2D textures mapped onto 3D objects. You're still out on an adventure, taking pictures along the way to uncover a phenomenon that is being kept hush, hush for the time being.

The sequel will feature special NPCs called Friends (aww), all of which have their own unique questline. Once you've wrapped up a quest, they'll give you a camera tool like, uh, scissors! Which cut things! As scissors are want to do. Or you'll get a hammer, no prize for guessing what that does. None of these things sound particularly camera related, but they look like fun ways to interact with the world. You can jump around and climb things now too, lots of ways to have some fun outside of taking a picture of a cheeky gnome.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for Toem 2 just yet, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">here</a>!
