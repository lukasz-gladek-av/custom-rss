            <p>
Good, bad, I don't bloody know yet the thing's only been about for five seconds, but we can certainly say one thing now: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-the-new-fps-from-former-apex-legends-and-titanfall-devs-hits-steam-early-access-after-weeks-of-teasing-silence">Highguard is out</a>. Now we can sit and prepare ourselves for more inane and pointless discourse about yet another live service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that we've probably had several times before. Hooray! But before we get ahead of ourselves, a moment of reflection, courtesy of the devs behind Highguard itself, who have spoken out about all that silence following their Geoffies reveal.
</p>
<p>
"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better," Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch explained to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ultimately-we-could-have-made-a-different-trailer-highguard-ceo-responds-to-that-poorly-received-game-awards-reveal/">PC Gamer</a> in a new interview. "Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback. 
</p>
<p>
"I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think [The Game Awards] was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient."
</p>
<p>
Welch went on to note that Geoff Keighley is a "friend of the studio" and had played the game prior to reveal, apparently saying he'd "love to do something different and put an indie studio and a free-to-play game" up at The Game Awards. Let's pause for a moment here to highlight that the use of the word indie here feels quite disingenuous, given that Wildlight is a 100+ person studio. Independent, sure, but we all know roughly what indie means, and it's not that. You made bleedin' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, come off it!
</p><p>
Anyway, design and creative director Jason McCord also explained that the trailer at The Game Awards was just meant to be a reveal, and then they'd keep quiet. "The plan was to announce, go dark, and then the next thing that we want players to see is the game. If the reception had been totally different, it would have been the same plan. The key is, you've got to play the game." Essentially, an attempt at repeating what Apex Legends achieved on its launch.
</p>
<p>
I probably won't play it, however, as it really doesn't look to be my thing, so I'll let you lot be the ones to decide if this one gets to stay in the very empty hall of live service shooters.

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye! Embark have shared some more concrete details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raider's</a> next main update, Headwinds, which is set to be downloaded onto your platform of choice tomorrow, January 7th. Namely, just what that new matchmaking option is, which is, as it seems, one that won't be for everyone.
</p>
<p>
As previously detailed, this new matchmaking option will only be for those of you that are level 40 and upwards, because it allows you to fly solo into a lobby filled with squads. Aye, that means it's just you and the whims of individual groups. Apparently this particular matchmaking mode will net you extra XP, but that sounds to be about it for now. Doesn't sound particularly worth it given extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>' whole thing, but hey, I'm sure some of you out there like the thrill.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>The ice has thawed - Unprepared Raiders have fallen, the hardy survivors must press on. Here’s what’s coming tomorrow when Headwinds launches!<br>Solo VS Squads<br>• A new matchmaking option for LV40+ Raiders, take on full squads as a solo Raider for higher risk… <a href="https://t.co/Rg69cT3gil">pic.twitter.com/Rg69cT3gil</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2015832160020697466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
There is also a new trophy display feature, which allows you to harvest those nasty old ARCs for "prizes," with a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/headwinds-content-update">blog post</a> explaining, "Build out your trophy case, progress through the levels, and unlock valuable items in the process." On top of that, you might start to notice flocks of birds flying around particular spots on the Buried City map. Head to their nests and you may find some convenient loot, but of course this'll be something everyone can find, so keep the challenge in mind as well. Lastly, there's a couple of new cosmetic sets, like the Sandwalker set for some stealthy vibes.
</p>
<p>
Nothing too game changing to be found here, though that new solos vs groups option sounds like it'll be a bit contentious. You can probably place bets on a future patch tweaking how much XP you do or don't get. In any case, Embark recently outlined a bunch of other plans for the game slated to arrive over the next few months, which you can have a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-devs-reveal-plans-for-new-large-arc-a-fresh-map-two-expeditions-and-extra-matchmaking-options">here</a>.

            <p>Created by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, Highguard was the final game announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">December 2025’s Keighley Awards</a>. It’s a free-to-play, guns &amp; sorcery, PvP raid shooter in which magic cowboys in capes vie for control of an uncharted continent. It’s got temples, airships, rideable panthers, fireballs, frost giants, and enchanted siege engines on caterpillar tracks. It’s also out now on Steam. That was quick.</p>

<p>Highguard has kindled a lot of curiosity by having almost zero marketing - a pleasant reprieve from the usual drip-feed of pre-order bait that has provoked acute withdrawal symptoms among news writers addled by years of character spotlight trailers. Geoff Fest trailer aside, the game has cruised along on the strength of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">the following scanty Steam blurb</a>: “From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<p>I’m not particularly enticed by that elevator pitch, but I do like me a setting that can’t decide whether it's Call Of Duty or God Of War. I also approve of the developer’s possibly calculated silence following the announcement, because it has really annoyed a lot of people and I am a deeply pathetic human being. Pranksters have sought to fill the breach: a fake Bluesky call for fan art last week <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/will.bearwaves.com/post/3mcwfihuups2g">attracted</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsutter.bsky.social/post/3mcwsm6232c2m">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tannerofthenorth.bsky.social/post/3mcwt6wmm7k22">few</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vforvalensa.bsky.social/post/3mcwxrlopgk2g">responses</a> of the “I’m John Highguard” variety.</p><p>James included Highguard on his personal list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">most anticipated PC games of 2026</a>, despite observing of the aesthetic that “you could lose track of it in a bowl of porridge”. I’m a bit warmer on the visuals than James, but I can well imagine Highguard vanishing without trace. Still, I am also one of the many who didn’t see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> becoming more popular than bread. Perhaps we’ll look back on Highguard’s pre-launch period as a successful example of always leaving ‘em wanting more?</p>

            <p>When you were making plant pots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> and selling them to other players, you might not have thought you were laying the groundwork for a UK legal precedent that would define in-game gold as intangible property covered by the Theft Act 1968, but, well, here we are.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Popplewell has ruled on appeal that RuneScape's gold pieces are legal property, which is important for the ex-Jagex developer accused of stealing 705 billion of them.</p>

<p>According to the judgement handed down by <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4#end-of-document">the Court of Appeal</a>, while working as a content developer at Jagex, the developer Andrew Lakeman is accused of accessing 68 different players accounts and "stripp[ing] those accounts of hundreds of billions of gold pieces" worth £543,123 if converted into RuneScape bonds, an item that can be bought for gold and exchanged for game membership. Jagex alleges this all took place in 2018. Lakeman and his solicitor dispute the charges.</p>
<p>When the case first went to trial last year, however, the judge dismissed the case agreeing with the defence's argument that RuneScape's in-game gold couldn't be legally defined as property under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents">Theft Act 1968</a>.</p>
<p>While the law does exclude certain items from being considered property, such as wild mushrooms and animals, it doesn't, oddly enough, list in-game currencies. However, to be considered a legally stealable item, something also has to be "rivalrous" and not "pure information". Meaning, as quoted within the case report: "if the use or consumption of the thing by a person, or of a specific group of persons, necessarily prejudices the use or consumption of that thing by one or more other persons.”</p><p>The judge ruled in favour of the defence because Runescape's in-game gold isn't "rivalrous", because if one player has gold, it doesn't take away another player's ability to get it. “Gold pieces within [Runescape] are not sufficiently rivalrous to be classed as intangible property," the judge said. "One gold piece is the same as any other, and their supply is infinite. The fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth, without taking it from existing players. This means, in my judgment, that even if the Crown is able to prove every single factual assertion that forms the basis of its case, the offences currently charged are not made out in law and I would not be prepared to leave them to a jury.”</p>
<p>However, the judge left their ruling open to appeal and appeal the prosecution bloody well have. The ruling went to the Court of Appeals, and ended up in front of Lord Justice Popplewell. Hold onto your legal pads, reader.</p>
<p>"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Popplewell writes. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite'. This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p>
<p>Effectively, just because each gold piece in RuneScape is identical and functionally the same, does not make it something that a player can be deprived of.</p>
<p>"The Judge’s second reason was that '[t]he fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth without taking it from existing players'," Popplwell continues. "However this too is no answer to the rivalrousness of the in-game wealth which a particular player already has at any given time. It focuses only on different assets which may thereafter be acquired."</p>
<p>After all, if you had had 100 million gold taken from you and someone said, 'Don't worry, at least it won't stop other players from earning gold', you might say that doesn't make a jot of difference to you.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Popplewell lays out their reasons for granting the prosecution's appeal, saying that RuneScape's gold pieces "are properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language. They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge': functionally they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen. On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p>While you may not want to read the whole case document, as it is a pretty extensive read, it is full of interesting examples of other legal precedents. For instance, there was the Oxford student accused of theft for taking an exam paper, even though they returned it, because they now possessed the questions that were in the document. Or the discussion that compares forbidden real money transfers in games to theft of Class A drugs.</p>
<p>With the Court of Appeal's decision now handed down, it would appear that the original case can now proceed.</p>
