            <p>A recent update to Steam allows developers to list a planned 1.0 release date for their Early Access games. While developers have always been free to share this information in blog posts or in the description on the store, in the past, they couldn't flag a game's planned release so clearly.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a small change, I'm thrilled to see it. Steam Early Access can be an excellent tool for developers, allowing them to put their game into players' hands and earn money without waiting until it's ready for a 1.0 release, but it can be a mixed bag for players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its best form, an Early Access game launches in a playable (if unfinished) state, it then receives a string of updates, before eventually ending in a full release. But there are many games that never make it all the way to 1.0. As much as a developer may wish to finish a game, if they run out of funds, they might choose to move onto another project entirely. There are more than a few Early Access games in my library that haven't been added to in years, and I know the developers have either shut up shop or moved on to something else.</p>
<p>Before buying a game that's in Early Access, I now find myself having to become a detective – checking for when it was last updated or seeing if the developer is working on another, more recent project. I don't want to distrust the game maker, but I also don't want to spend money on an unfinished game that will never see its final version.</p><p>While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english">Valve's latest update to Steam</a> doesn't change things radically – as I say, developers were free to write about the planned 1.0 release dates before, both on Steam and off it – it does make it a little easier when browsing games to see if a project is nearly finished or still a long way off. A developer could still blow through a release date or delay it, but this seems somehow more concrete and easier to hold a game maker accountable.</p>
<p>There is more to this change than first appears, too. As Valve say "Last year we introduced the Steam Personal Calendar, and realized one valuable kind of 'release' was missing from the UI: upcoming transitions from Early Access to 1.0. With an official 1.0 date display, we could give those transitions an official display in Personal Calendar, and help address the developer requests around formally showcasing the planned 1.0 release."</p>
<p>This means that if you wishlist a game that's in Early Access, it should now appear in your personal calendar when it's near a 1.0 release. So, if you're not keen on buying a game that's in an open-ended Early Access state, but you're happy to pick up a copy when you know it's definitely coming out and near release, you can now do that more easily.</p>
<p>So, as I say, a small change, but a welcome one.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aethus">Aethus</a> is a crafty new sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> in which one woman and her flying drone pal excavate a layered underground world on behalf of a galactic megacorp. You’ll create a surface base from holographic modules, gather evidence about a doomed science expedition, research a wacky new element, and unearth the dirty secrets of your employer. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds a lot like Coffee Stain’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, with opportunities for automation later on, but it’s viewed from an elevated third-person perspective, and appears more narrative-driven. Satisfactory through the eyes of Diablo? I can - as we space miners like to say – 'dig it', though I’m quite weary of games about being the lonely stooge of some breezily villainous extraction racket. This particular seam of satire has long since been gutted. I am ready for games in which we go to other planets for Nice reasons. I feel like that ought to be possible. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
Aethus is the work of Edinburgh, Scotland-based Pawsmonaut Games, whose founder Alex Kane is a former Rockstar QA tester, Build A Rocket Boy scripter (in various capacities), and Splash Damage senior technical designer. Aethus is his first self-funded and published project, and he seems very keen on doing it Right, with a Steam page that boasts of being “fully committed to old-fashioned ethical game development”, with “no use of AI, no early access, no microtransactions or purchaseable cosmetics.” Which is maybe overegging your rectitude a little - we have well and truly entered the age of using no-AI assurances for marketing - but I like the forthrightness. 
</p><p>
I’m also keen on what I’ve seen of the caves in Aethus. Any game about chewing through volcanic strata in pursuit of long-dead boffins is talking my language. I’m less enthused about the mining, which seems lumbering and charmless – laser 100 boulders, then drag the bits from your inventory to the fabricator. The modular base components have more charisma – you can build glass tunnels with the requisite, mildly hopeless coffee tables and plant pots - but they're very in keeping with other games in the genre.</p>
<p>In addition to being bored of survival games featuring cheerily bastardacious mining companies, I am ready for the “next generation” of base-building, whatever that looks like. I’m tired of bolting holograms together. I'm not alone in harbouring these misgivings. Why, only this week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-lot-of-survival-games-are-really-boring-abiotic-factor-developer-says-many-game-makers-are-too-focused-on-mechanics-and-not-enough-on-vibes">argued that</a> -

*Managerial chatbot voice cuts in* “We apologise for our employee’s ambivalence about corpo villainy and holographic building systems. Our employee has now been sustainably transferred according to Subsection 3, Clause 5.1 of the Astral Resource Corporation Human Resource and Composting Handbook. Why not stop by the base canteen to sample our fine selection of good old-fashioned, 100% naturally Edwin-grown Fungo-Furters. Aethus launches on 6th March. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/">Read more on Steam</a>.”
