            <p>November is here. The sunny uplands are far behind us. The great gilded procession of Videogaming trundles and cavorts through the deep forest. The bells of the indie jesters are muffled by fog, and the CEOs peer anxiously from their carriages of scarlet and bronze, instructing their guardsmen to beware the union organisers concealed in the undergrowth. Keep watching the trees. Everytime you glance away, they look a little more like placards. Do you see the moths, idly winking on boughs? They are the Maw's eyes. Those distant, whistling spirals of pine, somehow immobile behind the foreground trunks, in defiance of the rules of perspective? They are the Maw's lungs. Those squirrels having shouting matches with magpies? Erm. The Maw's thrombocytes, maybe.
</p>
<p>Listen! The crunch of twigs and leaves under hobnailed boots. Approaching torches. It is a refugee party of freshly released PC games. Let us pick the heartiest or strangest from their ranks to bolster our forces, before the shadows close in for good.
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 3rd November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2501920/Realms_of_Madness/">Realms of Madness</a> is a castlebuilder RTS that is played from side-on. I wouldn't build castles in realms of madness, myself. Perhaps there was no land available for purchase in the Realms of Lucidity.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3108130/Bigfoot_Life/">Bigfoot Life</a> (pictured) is an Abominable Snowman sim in which you gather mushrooms while trying not to be photographed by silly conspiracy theorists. Get out of here, Agent Mulder! Go on, git.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3672300/Babbling_Brook/">Babbling Brook</a> is a physics sandbox in which you try to transport some jovial quacking landfill to the sea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 4th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> is about managing footballs. Another physics sandbox, I guess? There may be human football players involved but the title gives zero indication of this, so I am forced to assume there aren't in the name of journalistic accountability.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis V</a> is another run-the-world simulator from Paradox in which, going by Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">review</a>, you will spend a lot of time watching your population evaporate because you forgot to unclick "Bubonic Plague" two centuries ago.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Wednesday 5th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-static-drive">Dead Static Drive</a> sees you chugging across 80s North America in your cadillac or Dodge Charger, trying not to be eaten by Lovecritters.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a> is a turn-based street brawler in which you assemble manga pages to perform attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 6th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</a> is about building island factory towns for the fat cats back at court, and possibly overthrowing them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-players-online">No Players Online</a> is a filled-out spiritual successor to the 2019 freeware game about being stuck in a haunted multiplayer server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is a rhythm-matching anime arcade game about a girl doing crimes in a city where music is forbidden.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2897610/Egging_On/">Egging On</a> is about an egg that's trying its best.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 7th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488850/MY_FATHER_LIED/">My Father Lied</a> is an adventure game about a young Iraqi woman searching an abandoned Mesopotamian museum for clues about her father's disappearance.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702300/THRASHER/">Thrasher</a> is the new rhythm-bashing creature feature from some of the people behind Thumper. This time you're a sizzling space eel, not a silver hellbeetle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The newcomers we have chosen join our train with a few muffled words, clustering behind the triple-A bandwagons where the guard presence is thickest. Those we have turned away file past in silence, neither judging nor forgiving, and continue their journey down another path, one of the dozens of forgotten ways that stitch this midnight forest together.</p><p>Is there a PC game we have denied that really belongs on the list above? Speak up and without fear. After all, there is no telling for sure which path will lead us through to the warmth and safety of Yuletide. Perhaps they are all wrong. Perhaps all these roads will only carry us further into the Maw's stinking guts.</p>

            <p>Birds chirp and gentle breeze floats by as you sip your tea. A tank rolls by, a shell explodes, and someone gets wiped out by machine gun fire. You remain relaxed. This is, after all, the stated goal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s freshly introduced Casual Breakthrough mode, designed for those who wish to battle fields "without the intensity of a full PvP lobby".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Casual Breakthrough's aimed at providing "a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges", EA said in their <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819">announcement of the new mode</a> over the weekend. Its matches feature smaller teams which feature 32 bot teammates/enemies outnumbering 16 real players, with each squad made up of 16 bots and eight human field battlers. Siege of Cairo and Empire State are the maps it's been applied to out of the gates.</p>
<p>While Casual Breakthrough doesn't dish out dogtags, accolades, or update your career stats, it does offer several forms of XP progression and the chance to complete challenges. To be precise, Career XP, Weapon XP, and Battle Pass XP are all on offer, with actions involving real players dishing out full XP and those involving bots only offering half.</p>
<p>That mix, coupled with the XP and challenge farming that's been an element of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> since it prone-crawled into its full release state, seems to pitch the mode as a sort of holiday retreat where folks can grind away at individual goals without having to focus as much on trying to win matches for their team. Well, at least without risking having an uber-competitive teammate shout at you. I assume there's still the risk of someone shouting at you because you're getting in the way of them leveling up their gun. We'll see how the mode fares in time in terms of living up to that purpose.</p><p>Meanwhile, in other XP-related news, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984674602006855747">EA have picked up on an "issue"</a> affecting the amount of XP being earned in Strikepoint matches. From the looks of it, another exploit that could be used to farm XP without putting in intended hard yards is the issue in question. "To maintain fair and consistent progression, we've made some temporary adjustments to XP in this mode while we investigate a longer term solution," EA wrote.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever, you respond. Jets fly overhead as you place the bits of cucumber back over your eyes and sink into your camo-liveried sun lounger.</p>
