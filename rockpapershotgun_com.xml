            <p>
A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update is here, version 1.0.5, with this one mostly having a focus on parkour improvements. There are, however, a couple of collaborations that have arrived in the game too, one with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and another with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. We'll get to those in a second, for now let's take a look at those parkour tweaks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, you can jump now! Well, you can do a vertical jump to be specific, letting both Naoe and Yusuke hop in an upwards direction to grab ledges or overhangs within reach. There's also now a sprint toggle lock option, meaning as long as you're moving, you won't stop sprinting if you use the parkour up or down options.

<p>
Some enhanced back and side ejects have been added in too, specifically the distance and height of them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> noting that foot landings will be favoured over hand landings. Naoe specifically will have some new animations when she does a height-gaining side eject.
</p>
<p>
You'll find a good few new photo mode features alongside all of this, with things like the ability to change the time of day, playing music while you're tweaking your shots, the ability to save custom filters, and for PC specifically, a fullscreen option.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those collabs. The first is a Dead by Daylight event, which Ubisoft describes as follows: "As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat…" You can start this new quest from your hideout once you've unlocked Yasuke, and once you've beaten it you'll get a trinket and banner.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the Balatro collab. That damn card game really has it's hooks in all of us, 'ey? This one is just a new trinket for Naoe and amulet for Yasuke called Winning Hand. These both offer a legendary perk that "gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders." How do you get these new items? "You will need to work together to figure out how to get it!" says Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
There's a bunch of other general fixes with this update to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game too, but you can read about all of those over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a>.

            <p>You may remember that in January of 2022, A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-pooh stories entered the public domain, inspiring deeply crap ideas like "what if children's character but knives?" in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh:_Blood_and_Honey">Blood And Honey</a> , and "what if children's character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Screwed">but mildly naughty word?</a>", in the case of smirking billboardian human doppelganger Ryan Reynolds. Videogames were not immune. "What if children's character but Cronenbergian body horror?" asked the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/winnies-hole">Winnie's Hole</a> when they announced a roguelike dungeon crawler based on the bear in 2023, and there's now a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">Steam demo </a>available, should you wish to scoop up honey with arms-where-no-arms-should-rightly-be.</p>

<p>Unlike Ryan Reynolds, developer Twice Different have at least made things worth the Mint Mobile receipts they're printed on before, reckons Nate (RPS in peace), who enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-ring-of-pain">despicable owl-em-up Ring Of Pain</a>. That was also a card-shuffling dungeon crawler. This time around you'll be playing as a Winnie-borne virus, mutating through the bear's yellow innards to "refine his primitive form" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> sections, then commandeering your freakish host in roguelike battles. After a trailer? Eeyore then…</p>

<p>The sweet features, they sing to me:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Winnie's Hole is out later this year. If you're a developer that fancies parodying Mickey Mouse for whatever commercial use you'd like please reach out to me, Nic Reuben, the sole rights holder. Mario too. Maybe you could...make them kiss? It's up to you!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
