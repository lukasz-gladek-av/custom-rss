            <p>Right, put your hands on the table. Please. I won't ask again. Thank you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">arrived on PC</a> as of June 11th, and naturally that's brought a new lease of life the the modding community who'd only had a demo to play with up until that point. Around 40% of the game's mods over on the Nexus right now are a bit risqu√©, so we've done you a favour and picked out the three filthiest on offer.</p>
<p>Don't feel you have to thank us. Well, me. This is all part of the job description, alongside all of the holding power to account and providing a service to the consumer stuff. Odds are my Pulitzer's already in the post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Okay, you ready? Having searched through the 222 Stellar Blade works <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/stellarblade/mods?sort=downloads&amp;adultContent=false">on Nexus Mods</a> as of writing, I isolated the 90 tagged as 'adult', and calculated that those numbers meant the racy, lecherous, and bawdy stuff made up exactly 40.54% of the total. Then, my instincts kicked in. I began a search for the naughtiest of the naughty, the hardcore horniness-inducers. I found three things.</p>
<p>First of all, and promise me you'll remain calm, I found the work of modder WTails358. I present to you, dear reader, their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/11">Casual Wear</a>. As you'll see if you click that link after making sure there are no kids or people with pacemakers nearby, this utterly smutty mod clothes Eve in an incredibly chic autumnal turtleneck-style jumper with a dragon design on it.</p>
<p>That sumptuous garment, which tastefully bares her midriff, is paired with delightfully retro chunky trousers that form the perfect constrast via their bright porcelain hue. Completing the look are a striking aquatically-themed belt buckle in gold, and a pair of understated boots that combine practicality with high fashion. Reader, just breathe, I know your temperature's rising with every word, but you must maintain control.</p>
<p>If you're alright to continue, I'll introduce you to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/60">Formal Wear</a>. Steady now. Take deep breaths. I know, it's an elegant suit and tie combo that allows Eve to cut an equally striking and refined figure that'd look at home on any of the catwalks in Milan or Paris. C'est magnifique, especially twinned with the rounded spectacles that cast Eve as a shrewd, sharp individual who knows what good vintage burgundy tastes like. Phwoar indeed.
</p>
<p>However, you mustn't get carried away, because I have one more totally pornographic mod to show you. It's modder Tenshiken1's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/90?tab=description">Thomas the Tank Engine replacer</a> for the stalker boss. Oh no. You've blown your whistle. You'vre chugged along the tracks and let out a deep, lustful choo-choo. I hope you're proud of yourself. What would Sir Topham Hat think?</p>
<p>Well, at least you've got time to ruminate on your failings and appreciate the non-jiggly things in life while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shift-up-essentially-confirm-stellar-blade-2-is-in-the-works-havent-revealed-how-revealing-it-will-be">more info from Shift Up</a> about Stellar Blade 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature">promised earlier this year</a>, Valve have given Steam developers the power to tag their games as having certain accessibility features, including narrated game menus, ways of differentiating visual elements that don't rely on colour, and touch-only interaction. You'll now be able to search for games with these tags, and view the full list of accessibility features on each game's Steam page.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update is based on feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, according to Valve. Participating devs can make use of the system by means of a software wizard - ah, I find it vaguely comforting that people still call this kind of program a "wizard" - which walks them through each accessibility category. Valve say that "over 5000 applications" have already made use of the new tags.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games," they note <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500575275933763410">in a blog post</a>. "We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>The new accessibility tags are broadly divided into "visual", "audio", "gameplay" and "input". The "gameplay" bracket includes "adjustable difficulty" and "save anytime", while under "visual" we find options like "camera comfort", which lets players "adjust or disable uncomfortable camera movement such as screen shaking, camera bob, or motion blur".</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">full breakdown on Steamworks</a>, including Valve's notes on why each option is important to players.</p>
<p>The selection of taggable features could probably do with some expansion, and the FAQ descriptions themselves are rather brief and broad. When the accessibility tags were announced in April, accessibility-focussed website Can I Play That <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested</a> that Valve should base their system on the existing <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Games Initiative</a>, which aims to standardise accessibility tagging across every game store, to avoid confusing players.</p>
<p>"According to the list in the documentation there is a lot of overlap, and it's mostly Steam that is missing a few tags," Can I Play That wrote. "Steam's version also uses some different names and descriptions. Perhaps most importantly, there also seem to be differences in the criteria."</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad to see this kind of thing from Valve. There's certainly a business case for it, inasmuch as options for players with impaired vision need to be justified in terms of the balance sheet. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.3 billion people worldwide "experience a significant disability". Back in 2023, our James wrote a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">custom and adaptive controllers in particular</a>, discussing how corporate profit motives inevitably limit the options, together with the lingering problem of ableist players perceiving accessibility features as 'cheating'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
