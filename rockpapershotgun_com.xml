Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the 21st best-selling game of all time? It's sold more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>! At least by the numbers we currently have, anyway. I don't care all that much about sales figures, but if creator Eric Barone cared more about money, I can only imagine that a sequel would be all but guaranteed. As it turns out though, the developer could actually see himself making a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a>.
</p>

<p>
Barone recently appeared on the podcast Tiger Belly (thanks, GamesRadar), where host Bobby Lee asked why he doesn't just make a Stardew Valley 2 when he's constantly releasing new updates. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone explains. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas."

<p>
He noted that a lot of these ideas come about from playing the game himself and thinking, "'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way than to make a whole new game."
</p>
<p>
And then came the comment that struck fear into my heart: "I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest." I say fear, because Barone struggles to not update the original game, so much so he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-stardew-valley-is-finally-done-but-the-dev-behind-it-is-committed-to-not-working-on-it-until-haunted-chocolatier-is-done">somewhat forcing himself to stop working on it so he can actually finish Haunted Chocolatier</a>. However, Barone did also say that while he won't deny the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2, he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy, that's why I'm making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>."
</p>
<p>
So, really we've got a Schrodinger's Stardew Valley sequel here. Fingers crossed Barone doesn't get carried away and do it, I'd like to play Haunted Chocolatier before I retire.

            <p>
I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doloc-town">Doloc Town</a> is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here.

<p>
Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of Steam games, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/">launch discount on Steam</a> too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.
