            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developers Funcom have revealed in a post-launch Reddit AMA that they're currently aiming to release a fresh update full of quality of life-related tweaks in early July, as well as adding "new contracts across the board" down the line.</p>
<p>However, if you're after big new stuff to do, you'll have to wait for the major updates that'll be releasing alongside the game's DLCs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have an update in testing that contains a lot of quality of life updates, which we are aiming to release in early July," DA executive producer Scott Junior wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">in response</a> to a question about Funcom's immediate future plans, "When we get closer to it being publicly testable we will release the full patch notes. It contains too many changes for me to list here, but you'll be seeing it soon!"</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say there's a chance that update includes simple base building tweaks folks have been begging for, such as storage containers and vehicles you can name, as well as the option to deposit all of their water with one button press. All of those were confirmed as being in the works at different points in the thread.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in terms of bigger additions to the game, Junior explained: "each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out. Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months."</p>
<p>In terms of what the developer's plans are to tweak PvP, which has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/dune-awakening-devs-promise-a-bunch-of-changes-as-the-survival-mmos-pvp-and-endgame-content-come-under-fire-over-loot-balance-concerns-and-more-total-mess/">come under fire</a> from players early doors, DA senior game director Viljar Sommerbakk wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">scout ornithopter</a> won't be losing its rockets, with the devs instead instead aiming to make its performance vary depending on what gear you equip it with.</p>
<p>In line with that, specifically in terms of deep desert PvP, Sommerbakk said the devs are currently "formulating a plan" for changes based around three considerations. They want players to have to make "meaningful decisions" about their loadouts, the mode to feel "reliable, responsive, and clearly understood" moment to moment, and are fixing "issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability".</p>
<p>One of the major things players asked about in the thread was the possibility of the game getting more contracts for PvE folks to work through on a weekly basis, rather than running out of stuff to do. "There are plans to add new contracts across the board," wrote DA creative director Joel Bylos, "In addition, the Landsraad itself is supposed to involve more contracts in order to reveal tasks for the Houses. As well as contracts that lead into the Deep Desert."</p>
<p>In terms of the Landsraad, the devs were also clear they've read feedback about issues like tasks locking early or being too tough for solo players, and plan to rectify those as well as making sure folks feel like its rewards are worth the work.</p>
<p>As for folks missing out on Landsraad tasks that are claimed not long after they're released, Bylos replied that Funcom's "current plan is to allow your contributions to stack week after week, so that small groups and solos can work towards larger rewards over time. And then adding more tiers of rewards as well as new activity drivers".</p>
<p>It's a lot of spicy stuff to be sure. Funcom definitely aren't shying away from the raging sandworms of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">player opinion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mike Klubnika's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> was a simple, harrowing game about aiming a shotgun at your very own face and praying for a click, not a bang, then challenging a manky git across the table to do likewise. The developer's forthcoming s.p.l.i.t, by contrast, looks like a squirming snakepit of moving parts that calls to mind both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

In this "short psychological horror game", you are part of a team of hackers attempting to break into "an unethical superstructure". The whole thing appears to unfold in a small, grubby room full of crackling monitors, with despairing trees visible through a curtained window. Your job is to poke at a command prompt interface while bandying words with shadowy strangers over IRC. The below trailer is already giving me a migraine. I can feel my guts uncoiling in protest. How very glorious.

"The facility you and your crew infiltrate is a superstructure of unethical electronics," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3684610/split/">Steam page</a> adds. "The daunting task is only made possible by careful planning, and vulnerabilities hidden deep below legacy code and engineering." Be warned that the game will contain depictions of self-harm and suicide. That noose in the picture seemingly isn't just for show.

Alice O, greatest of news editors, is a fan of Klubnika's work. "I really like how his games are small visits to unexplained terrible places," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">wrote back in 2024</a>, shortly before she quit this stinking james gournalism business and, as legend tells, escaped to the mountains in a hamster-powered balloon.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure s.p.l.i.t. will be similarly dense and anomalous, and as such, I'm prepared to forgive the Tom Clancy-ass title punctuation here. Perhaps the abbreviation stands for "Send Pizza Lest I Tunnel (Past Your Network Security)"? We'll find out when the game hits e-shelves on 24th July. If you'd rather play more Buckshot Roulette, know that it now has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buckshot-roulette-now-has-a-4-person-multiplayer-mode-which-im-sure-you-will-survive">four-person multiplayer mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-founders-of-playdead-are-having-a-legal-war-over-who-made-more-of-limbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Many moons ago, Danish developers Playdead released bleak platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-limbo">proved beyond reasonable doubt</a> that Gamez R Art, while also giving a bunch of witless scriveners massive arachnophobia. Today, we learn that one of the studio's co-founders, Arnt Jensen, is suing the other, Dino Patti, amid competing claims about the scale of his contribution to Limbo. Because of course all great things must end in calamity.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our source of this story is Patti himself, who left Playdead in 2017 after the release of the wonderfully awful/awfully wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a>, and is currently boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/somerville">Somerville</a> developer Jumpship. He and Jensen have famously not been on great terms for years, but things <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">came to a boil in late 2024</a>, when Patti published an account of Limbo's development on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Back in March this year, Jensen argued that the LinkedIn post exaggerates Patti's contribution to Limbo, insisting that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game." He also claimed that the post includes an "unauthorised" photo.</p>
<p>For this alleged infringement, Playdead asked for 500,000 Danish kroner or $72,630 as "suitable compensation and reimbursement." Now, Patti has revealed that Playdead's lawyers are taking him to court in a podcast interview this week with Danish site <a href="https://arkaden.dk/nyheder/dino-patti-der-kommer-en-retsag/">Arkaden</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/limbo-and-inside-studios-new-game-is-a-3rd-person-open-world-sci-fi-adventure/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>For his part, Patti contends that Jensen is trying to delete him from the game's origin story. "Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he declared back in March. "I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." In the Arkaden podcast, Patti is upbeat about the situation, commenting that it's an opportunity to set the record straight, but with all due respect to the guy, that's the kind of thing you say when you're being sued.</p>
<p>None of this interferes with my eagerness to hear about Playdead's next game, "a third person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe", which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdead-reveal-art-for-their-secretive-inside-follow-up">revealed in 2017</a>. At the risk of sounding like I'm picking my favourite dad, I've yet to play Somerville, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">described</a> as an "interesting, if not particularly deep" spin on the Playdead school of apocalyptic minimalism.</p>
<p>I will ask Playdead and Jumpship for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
