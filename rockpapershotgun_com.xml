</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much in the same way that I started this year by telling my loved ones I would cut down my portion sizes in 2026 to attend to my ageing body, Zenimax Online Studios began the year by saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-yearly-expansions-and-folding-its-premium-content-into-the-base-game-but-its-also-gaining-a-battle-pass">they would be releasing smaller updates for Elder Scrolls Online</a> to refresh the MMO's creakier content.</p>
<p>Both Edler Scrolls Online and I shall end 2026 leaner and able to climb stairs without our knees popping.</p>
<p>But, in announcing its move from Expansion-sized chapters released every 12 - 18 months to smaller Season updates released every three months, it wasn't clear what this meant for new zones. Would the world of Tamriel stay locked at its current size, with additional areas being too large a thing to add in a Season update?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many players have expressed concern that we're not doing zones anymore," game director Nick Giacomini tells me in a follow-up interview, "That's not true. We are. We are doing zones, and we're going to talk more about that very soon."</p>
<p>While Giacomini won't be drawn on exactly where may be added to Tamriel next, he said "I think players will be happy when they see what's coming in the next twelveish months."</p>
<p>Though, he does say players should expect changes on what to expect from a new zone. "With [zones], like everything, we're asking ourselves instead of just 'Here's a zone, exactly the way that you've experienced zones [before],' we're taking a look at it at a fundamental level. What can we change here to make this more interesting, exciting and in line with what players want, so it'll be a different flavour."</p><p>Explaining the miscommunication, executive producer Susan Kath says "We had 45 minutes to deliver a huge amount of information, much of which is difficult to convey when we can't actually show it yet." One area players are wanting more information is around Tamriel Tomes, the MMOs new battle pass system. "It would be a heck of a lot easier if I could just be like, 'Here, I'm in the game. Let me show you exactly what I mean by this'," continues Kath. They will be adding clarifying details in live streams, AMAs, and explanatory posts in the coming months.</p>

<p>While Giacomini won't talk about what or how new zones will be added to Elder Scrolls Online, he will say how the team plan to enrich the world of Tamriel. In the same stream when they announced the move to Seasons, Giacomini and Kath explained that Orsinium, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and the Imperial City will be folded into the base game. Previously these locations and their associated quests were all held back as premium content.</p>
<p>This broadening of the base game, Giacomini argues, will lead to more opportunities for all players. "It gives us more flexibility. When we wanted to make something available for all players in the past that meant, we had to design within these base game zones. And while those zones are big, you're doing yet another series of quests in Auridon, or what have you. This enables the design team to explore more."</p><p>Now a quest can be made available to all players that takes them from Auridon to the Imperial City with a stop off in Orsinium without the designers needing to worry about what expansions a player has bought. Giacomini says before the team would ask themselves, "If we do, that means only X percent of players are going to be able to participate."</p>
<p>Again, Giacomini falls short of saying what these news quests will be, but he points to what was said in the announcement stream. "We talked about Western <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> being folded in as well. Chronologically, that's much later than Somerset. But it makes sense, because we're going to be releasing something within the Skyrim areas, and we want to allow as many players as possible to participate."</p>
<p>This broader canvas upon which to draw new questlines sounds promising, bringing new life to old areas. We still have to wait and see how well Zenimax Online Studios delivers on its promises for these smaller updates. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">Giacomini and Kath say that the team's capacity to deliver wasn't impacted by last year's layoffs</a>. The truth of that will be proved in March with the launch of Season Zero.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté is suing Ubisoft for damages, alleging that his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">abrupt October departure from the company</a> after 20 years wasn't a matter of personal choice, but a case of "constructive dismissal". That, in <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/dismissals/constructive-dismissal">non-legalese</a>, means that the developer believes he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid a round of corporate musical chairs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">CBC Radio-Canada</a>, Côté's lawsuit against Ubisoft has been filed in Quebec and seeks $1.3 million Canadian dollars  - around $935,000 in US currency - in damages on his behalf. That cash is designed to cover two years worth of the developer's salary, plus moral damages and an additional lifting of a non-compete clause which currently limits his games industry job options.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Côté learned in a summer 2025 meeting that as part the Ubisoft rearrangement which came with the company setting up a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">new Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> to oversee the running of Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, they'd be installing a "head of franchise" based in France. According to Canada-based Côté, that gig absorbed lots of his duties as Assassin's Creed series head, and he was subsequently offered roles as Assassin's Creed production head reporting to that new head of franchise or as the leader of a "creative house” overseeing another Ubisoft game series.</p>
<p>Seeing that as a demotion, Côté's lawsuit asserts that he took two weeks to think about things, then declined and asked for his severance pay. Ubisoft are cited by the suit as having responded by telling him not to show back up to work, then announcing his departure in a fashion which painted it as being your standard voluntary parting of ways.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>When RPS reached out to the publishers for comment following Côté's initial comments about his departure back in October, we received the following response:</p>
<blockquote>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build. We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how these legal wranglings shake out.</p>

            <p>Rockstar North, the Edinburgh office of GTA 6 developers Rockstar Games, has been cordoned off by emergency services following reports of an explosion in the building.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburgh Live</a> and <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">The Herald</a> report that local fire crews were called out to Holyrood Road at around 5AM on January 19th.</p>
<p>"We were alerted at 5.02AM on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, reads a statement given to the latter by a spokesperson for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. "Operations Control mobilised three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9.21AM."</p>
<p>Both local outlets outline that the exact nature of what happened isn't fully clear as of yet, but cite reports suggesting an "explosion in a boiler room" was the cause of the incident.</p>
<p>That's it for details as of writing, I'll update this article or link out to a separate one as or when more information arrives.</p>
<p>This incident comes amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">legal proceedings between Rockstar Games and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union</a>, with the latter representing 31 former Rockstar employees which the company fired last year. Rockstar allege the staff were dismissed for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, while the union have accused them of union busting. As part of the initial response to the firings, Rockstar North's Edinburgh offices were the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">site of a union protest last November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, as of right now there is no suggestion of a causal connection between this incident and the above events.</p>
