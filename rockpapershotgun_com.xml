            <p>Life simulation game Inzoi will launch on PC via Steam early access on 28th March 2025, publishers Krafton have announced. Billed as a potential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">Sims 4</a> usurper, and equipped with syrupy Unreal Engine 5 visuals, it was originally slated for launch this year.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-begins-its-fight-for-the-sims-crown-with-a-time-limited-character-creator-trial-on-august-20th">released a free character editor of the game in August</a>. Graham was somewhat taken by it, though he was more taken by the prospect of driveable cars, an editable city, and planned mod support at launch. As for me, I quite like the bustling downtown areas and ferris wheels visible on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on Discord (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/inzoi-launches-in-early-access-on-march-28-2025">Gematsu</a>), producer and director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim justified the delay with hokey reference to human biology. "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," he wrote. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI - a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth." </p>
<p>I wonder if clinical physicians ever tell anxious new parents not to worry about kids being slow learners because after all, it is said that among video games, raising an early access project to 1.0 status takes the longest time because developers must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. And really, when you think about it, the extra love and care that is required to properly nurture an early access game is how you should see your journey with little Timmy here, who has just shoved an entire Barbie doll up his nose.</p><p>"This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZOI a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible," Kim went on. "Until the release date, we'll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come."</p>
<p>Well, can't make fun of that part, I guess. And I do wish Inzoi the best of luck taking on the Sims, nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">a Sims Universe</a> - hopefully, it'll fare better than Paradox's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">Life By You</a>. Though I have to say, I find it rather creepy that every Inzoi character I've seen looks like a catwalk model.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in the mists of 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effects-normandy-sr1is-in-no-mans-sky-now">No Man's Sky revealed its very own Normandy SR1 space frigate</a>. "The Normandy in No Man's Sky?" you cry. "Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a pilotable version in their own space sim.</p>
<p>"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!</p><!--more-->

<p>That's not all they're adding in the latest updates. No Man's Sky now supports cross-save, albeit in limited beta form to begin with. At last, you will be able to transfer all of your console saves to PC, where they belong. Here's some blurb - it sounds like implementing the feature has been atypically tricky.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man's Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p>
<p>It's very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn't even exist back then!</p>
<p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man's Sky players can connect their different platform accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Find the full bulletin about the Normandy/cross-save update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">here</a>. Of course, all this invites the question of when we'll hear more about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. Bioware released an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-release-new-mass-effect-5-epsilon-trailer-while-hinting-about-mass-effect-3-connections">"Epsilon" teaser trailer</a> on N7 Day last year, but the word is they're having a quieter one this year, presumably to avoid stealing any thunder from the recently launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
