In "non-violent and poetic" 2D platformer Symphonia, you're an extremely fancy violinist exploring a realm of musical machines, where gas lanterns kindle fitfully as you approach, crotchets adorn vast cogwheels, and reams of what I really hope isn't actual catgut feed through titanic pegboxes overhead. Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. <!--more-->

"Superbesque!" I breathed, watching myself casually tear off a violin solo to magic open a door. "Magnifissimos!" I sang, watching myself artfully bounce my violin bow off the floor and catch it to double-jump. "Bravanche!" I honked, watching myself evaporate against some spikes. While it's not a metroidvania, the cavernous, lamplit, whirring set-dressing puts me strongly in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and the eternally-forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Here's a trailer:

And here's some backstory: the aforementioned very fancy violinist is Philemon, who must gather the members of an orchestra and restore vitalising music to a world that has fallen into deathly silence. The levels and backdrops are a phantasmagoric, almost Cubist portrayal of instruments collapsed together into halls and shafts - I am keen to see more of them. Hollow Knight aside, it all reminds me just a little of Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> and Oddworld, which probably aren't the parallels developers Sunny Peak are going for. I mean, I assume there isn't an abbatoir level, but perhaps that's where they get all the catgut. </p>
<p>"Each area in Symphonia has its own distinct feel and characters, and each room is hand-crafted," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865960/Symphonia/">the Steam page adds</a>. "Meet prodigious musicians and try to convince them to join the orchestra."
</p>
<p>
And then there's the score, a bespoke piece of classical romance music, written by composer Olivier Esman and his partners Alexandre Bucas-Fran√ßais and Lou Corroyer. As regards the demo, at least, it's gently synched to your progress, with certain actions triggering the next movement. You'll also perform full-arsed concerts at intervals that are dedicated to a particular section of the orchestra - Strings, Brass and Woodwinds. I deduce from this that the game has a three-act structure.

Symphonia is out... now! And feels like a good festive pick if your idea of festive is a soothing melange of velvet, mahogany and candlelight. And spike pits. Here's some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYN1d3f2dc">Disney's Fantasia</a> to wash it all down.
