            <p>
Counter-Strike surfing is a modded game mode for Valve's bomb defusal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which players skate through obstacle courses by means of a Source engine physics glitch. It has a proud history dating back to 2004, when modder Charles "Mariowned" Joyce discovered that it was far more enjoyable to slide off roofs than shoot people in his custom map Killbox. So he made a new map dedicated to sliding, The Gap. Thus the greasy chute that led to Alice0 (RPS in peace) hailing CS surfing as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-surfing-is-the-esport-we-deserve">"the esport we deserve"</a> in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
People have crafted their own versions of the mode in games like Roblox, and Proper Game Developers such as Blizzard have seemingly taken inspiration - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s Lucio is surely a love letter to the mode. Now here comes SurfsUp, a free-to-play surfing game in the Godot Engine. Released this month, it's been favourably compared to surf maps in Valve's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, and is worth a pop even if you have no prior experience of counters or striking. Also, to clarify, it has nothing to do with that licensed penguin game for Xbox 360. Stand down, Cody Maverick groupies.

SurfsUp can be played solo or with friends. The free version provides access to a daily random map rotation - there are around 30 in all, including versions of classic community maps such as Utopia, Boreas, Summit, and Mesa. The free version also features voice chat and leaderboards, and you can earn different player models and animations in-game. The paid supporter bundle, meanwhile, gives you full control over map selection, together with premium cosmetics and the satisfaction of having actually contributed to the game's development, you filthy chancer.

<p>
It'll all run happily on a PC with graphicsability equivalent to a very small bowl of custard. And not the good custard, you understand. None of that lip-smacking Ambrosia stuff. I'm talking Hubbard's Foodstore, a brand of custard you would not feed to a starving dog. Learn more and play the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454830/SurfsUp/">Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">previously delayed</a> update 2.3 drops tomorrow, July 17th, CD Projekt have revealed in their latest livestream. It's mostly about giving you more options in terms of traversing the world, because adding in a whole metro system post-launch didn't do enough in that regard.</p>
<p>The studio will not stop, even though they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">now making Cyberpunk 2</a>. They've worked with fellow developers Virtuos to add-in some new cars, a taxi system, self-driving cars, and other stuff not related to getting from A to B.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The biggest aspects of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">the update</a>, though, are those aids for exploration. There are three new cars in total - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, the Rayfield Caliburn 'Mordred', and the Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus the game's first customisable motorbike, the Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa. All execept the Aquila come with small quests to complete to unlock them, so it isn't as simple as just buying from a website.</p>
<p>If you get one and don't fancy negotiating the traffic yourself, every vehicle in the game now has an auto-driving feature that'll transport you to your chosen map waypoint. Or, if you fancy taking a robotic cab instead, once you've completed the Delamain quest, you can call him up and request a taxi that'll drive you where you want to go. Sure, it's more immersive than flying through the roof of the map in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">a modded car/plane doing about 1000mph</a>, but is it really better?</p>

<p>These come with a new cinematic camera you can use to look around as you're driven about, and there's an auto-drive wandering mode you can activate if you just want a bit of a tour. That'll be cool to sit back and watch, though Cyberpunk's maybe a bit hardware intensive to be the ideal second monitor screen saver.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of extra crystalcoat and twintone customisation for cars, to ensure you can pimp your ride in whatever fashion you fancy. Then, there's the photo mode, which now offers you more control over the environment, plus access to a wide range of extra characters from the base game and alternate outfits for those characters - the idea being that if you see them wearing something in a quest, you'll be able to have them wear it once the quest is done.</p>
<p>As for technical updates, AMD FSR 4 and 3.1 frame generation support are coming, but you'll have to wait for a driver update at some point soon to be able to use the former. Intel XESS 2.0 and HDR10+ support also arrives with the update, so you can whip that out if you've got the hardware to match.</p>
<p>It's nice to see CD Projekt keep working on the game and adding in stuff players have requested, especially if it can be done via efficient development with help from Virtuos. Keeps us all cyberticking over until we're auto-driven to the sequel.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more]]></content:encoded>
