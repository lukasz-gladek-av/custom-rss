            <p>Hey, deez two. Sorry, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has just gotten a fresh patch following on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-new-update-adds-in-more-weapon-variations-boss-challenges-and-oh-no-a-really-hot-portrait-for-narcissus">beefy Unseen update</a> last month. The big news? Supergiant say this latest batch of tweaks "will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch".</p>
<p>Damn, maybe it's time for me to dive back in and get some extra practice taking down those pesky sirens that try to smite you mid-gig like they're aquatic Van Halen. Ok, maybe I actually mean fire the game back up to stare at Narcissus. Sue me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512962085601150265">Patch 10</a> largely consists of tweaks to the stuff added in by the Unseen update, as well as some handy general fixes. That said, the most noteworthy aspect of its notes is Supergiant revealing: "We'll keep monitoring your feedback, though this will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch, whenever that will be!"</p>
<p>So, still no full release date for the godly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> yet, but further confirmation that we're getting perilously close to its emergence from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access</a>, which'll see Melinoë's story get its "true ending".</p>
<p>Anyway, to help tide you over, let's get into the highlights of this patch. Supergiant have reduced the chance of "successive attacks causing you to become 'stun-locked'", as well as making sure any temporary armour you've got from the likes of Hephaestus' Security System is chipped down by damage before it starts affecting your regular protection.</p>
<p>Several of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms and their aspects have been boosted up or tuned down. The Sister Blades' omega attack is now uninterruptible by enemies and the Umbral Flames' omega special projectiles do more damage, but orbit more slowly. The Argent Skull's omega special wave projectiles don't stagger folks anymore, and the Black Coat has had several aspects of it buffed.</p>
<p>Patch 9's Oath of the Unseen looks to have been rendered a bit more difficult via tweaks to the Vow of Frenzy and Vow of Scars, with the former drafting in fresh foes more quickly and the latter now reducing your recovery as intended.</p>
<p>Other changes affect everyuthing from boons, to Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and hexes. One other fix that's caught my eye ensures that "Heracles no longer sometimes ominously just stands around after his encounters". Maybe he's just been waiting for news on that full launch date, Supergiant. </p>
<p>Right, now everyone disperse promptly. We can't just ominously linger, Hades 2's devs might start digging into our code.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Edwin gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549930/Ostrich_Farm/">Ostrich Farm</a> header honours in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-mecha-break-ice-protest-charity-bundles-and-vibrant-ostrich-farming">this week's Maw</a>, and with good reason I think. "Breed vibrant ostriches", he wrote. I misread it as "breed violent ostriches" and got excited. I still liked the concept even after realising my mistake. I pinned the Steam page tab (aka "The Coward's Wishlist"), and forgot about it for a couple of days.</p>
<p>This morning, I clicked on the tab again while browser tidying. "I wonder how Steam likes the ostrich game?", I mused. One review. A single, negative review. "The performance tanked for me once I had around 70 ostriches and made the game totally unplayable".</p>

<p>I have questions, but I'm mostly just now more intrigued about the true nature of the ostrich game. Is this a normal quantity of ostriches to have in Ostrich Farm, or did the player implement some sort of rampant Muskoid breeding schedule? The maximum number of ostriches shown in a screenshot is 42 ostriches. It does not seem unreasonable to ask for 28 more.</p>
<p>I picture a single vibrant plume fluttering down to land on a fried motherboard, the air alight with dust-mote delicate feather fragments and the smell of singed components. How many ostriches must someone have before their world collapses in on itself, is not a line from Blowin' In The Wind but probably should have been.</p>
<p>I cannot rightfully say that the ostrich game deserves better because I haven't played it yet. One may argue that an ostrich game that cannot bear the weight of 70 ostriches has no right calling itself an ostrich game in the first place. Still, I feel many of the world's problems could be solved if more people realised that if 60 ostriches do not bring one happiness, it's very likely the extra ten ostriches will not improve the situation.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-performance-tanked-for-me-once-i-had-around-70-ostriches-is-my-new-favourite-negative-steam-review-of-all-time]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Toys! Small toys shaped like things I know from videogames! With rules so I can make them fight each other! Again!  <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">The Witcher: No Man's Land</a> is a miniatures skirmish game set (I assume since Letho is still palling around with Nilfgaard) somewhere around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings</a>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">starter set</a> out later this year with Geralt, Letho, a Griffin, a Striga, and some mates. It uses some of the same models from Cyberpunk publisher R. Talsarion's Witcher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, so you can <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/collections/witcher">peruse or pick up a few of these already</a>. I would recommend waiting if you're tempted, though. Starter sets generally come with a chunky discount over buying models individually, and you'll get the extra bits like cards that you need to play the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For the blissfully uninitiated, skirmish games are effectively very small tabletop wargames. You only need a handful of models instead of dozens, and this focus usually means that the rules are more characterful and snappy. Personal faves include <a href="https://ttcombat.com/collections/carnevale">Carnevale</a> (Lovecraftian Venice with drunk Pulcinellas riding ostriches) and <a href="https://shop.moonstonethegame.com/">Moonstone</a> (Brian Froud-ian folklore weirdos and fairyfolk).</p>
<p>On the subject of snappiness, The Witcher: No Man's Land has one of my favourite miniature games rules, namely counterattacks. If you've ever had fun with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, know that the 40K tabletop equivalent here is waiting for whoever rolled the highest number to shoot at you for 45 minutes before you get to do anything (I'm simplifying, but that's the gist). In No Man's Land, you've got a reaction system where you can counter wounds your opponent inflicts with your own attacks and abilities, or just run off.</p>

</figure>
<p>I also just really like these models, especially that elfy alchemist. Lotsa character. Slightly goofy and exaggerated. but not too much.</p>
<p>It also sounds like there's both co-op and PvPvE options with the monsters, which feels nicely thematic. The game controls the creatures, so you might get a rampaging griffon interrupting your duels, things like that. No exact release date or price on this yet, but you can sign up on the website to stay up to date. Monster Fight Club also make some Cyberpunk skirmishers that reviewed quite well. I'm oddly charmed by <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/products/combat-zone">the miniature Arasaka crate in this one</a>, for some reason.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ease-the-witcher-4-wait-with-tiny-plastic-geralt-in-a-new-skirmish-miniatures-game]]></content:encoded>
