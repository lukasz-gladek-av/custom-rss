            <p>Armchair History Interactive would like to you know that their upcoming strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-command">Master Of Command</a> is full of smart, unforgiving systems. I know that because they emailed RPS saying that our "strategy features often spotlight smart, unforgiving systems".</p>
<p>I imagine several other outlets also received this exact email but this didn't stop me thinking "you know what - they're right! I <em>am</em> strategy-clever and tactics-tough! And what better way to show that than by covering this game, completely of my own volition and with no outside influence from cleverly worded PR emails playing on my sense of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-knower's pride. That'll show those fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee. Who's "making too many explosiony noises during this serious reenactment of the Somme" now, eh?</p>
<p>Truthfully though, I probably would have covered this without the email. It looks suitably grand, and I really dig the idea of a strategy where the management isn't about empires, but the personal journey of your army on campaign. Plus, you get to play uniform dress-up. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game is set during the Seven Years' War, and you'll be managing your army's supplies, soldiers and equipment across the campaign. Lose all your lads, you lose the run. The line from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">Steam</a> description that really hooked me is this'n:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Master of Command is about the relationship between your army and the world around it. March too far and your men will starve. Rest too long and the enemy will reinforce. Your troops rely on you not just to lead them into battle, but to keep them fed, equipped, and alive long enough to reach the final objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't march on an empty stomach, though. That'd be madness. First, fill your belly with features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Tactical Battles:</strong> No turns, no pausing. Engage in historical combat where morale, stamina, terrain, and timing determine the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Regiments:</strong> Equip your troops with historical equipment and weapons that affect accuracy, stamina, morale, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Campaign:</strong> Choose a region and enter a fully real-time map with fog of war, branching encounters, and a mobile enemy presence.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Army Management:</strong> Every loss matters. Units gain experience, officers level up, and your choices carry across each region of the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>150 Historical Units:</strong> Recruit from an extensive roster of 18th-century European forces, each with unique stats, roles, and visuals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Of Command is out sometime this year. I'm going to paint all the hats pink, see how those damn fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee like that one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/master-of-command-is-a-strategy-game-of-crunchy-musketry-and-total-war-style-battles-that-tells-the-story-of-an-army-not-an-empire]]></content:encoded>

Deep beneath the smog of a plausibly denied planetoid, there lurks a space hulk full of dessicated hand monsters, shorn dreadlocks and long-emptied Pulse Rifles. The vessel mostly lies silent, but every so often, an ancient server deep within the core crackles awake, beaming an ominous signal far out into the void, and the chitinous corridors come alive with flamethrowers and squelchy stabbing noises and oh, so much screaming. Also, the coveted chirping of Steam achievements.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The vessel in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-vs-predator">Alien Vs Predator</a>. Not Rebellion's original three-way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 1999, mind, but the 2010 threequel which people derided at the time, but which is clearly some gradation of Good Video Game in that a few of those people are still playing it, 15 years later. 
</p>
<p>
This weekend, the supposedly dead game enjoyed a sudden Steam playercount bounce to around five thousand concurrent players, care of a community-run server. Many were motivated by the desire to earn one of the game's rarest Steam achievements, The Six Pack, which requires you to play a ranked match with six Steam friends. That a whopping 2.2% of players have earned this to date suggests (out of context) that the original AVP multiplayer scene died on its arse rather quickly. So it's nice that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/10680">somebody's coordinating efforts to boost the numbers</a>. We'll make it to 3.0 someday. Perhaps in another 15 years.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing this up partly because it's evidence of the good that can happen when publishers take steps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">to ensure that their online games can be played after the cessation of official support</a>. And partly, I'm writing it up because it's nice to revisit Rebellion's Alien games. The 1999 game was a frantic pressure-cooker shooter with excellent lighting, in that you generally couldn't see the Aliens until you flash-bulbed them with muzzle fire. It also featured many lovely adaptations of the film sets, which you could clamber all over as a sticky-fingered xenomorph. It didn't do nearly as good a job with the Predators, but then again, there has never been a good Predator game. You know I speak truth, Yautja lovers. Fight me.
</p>
<p>
The 2010 game has been much shat-upon. In our review, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-aliens-vs-predator">witheringly summed it up</a> as "not a terrible singleplayer shooter", "just a very ordinary one", adding that the multiplayer almost saves it: "when a couple of adept players are stalking random panickers like myself, this really threatens to be the game we hoped it would be." I was similarly unenamored when I reviewed the game for some magazine or other, but the community drive for Six Pack achievements has me yearning for the dropship.
</p>
<p>
The Six Pack initiative seems to have prompted a wave of Overwhelmingly Positive Steam reviews. I was tickled by the one that objects that the game should more properly be called "Marines vs Aliens vs Predator". I like the implication that human players of Aliens vs Predator - which I estimate covers about about 70% of you, based on the wording and tenor of the average RPS comment - are in danger of feeling left out. Also, Marines aren't a species, but don't let that stop you launching a Change.org petition. While you're at it, see if you can get Godzilla vs Kong retitled Godzilla vs Kong vs Commuters.
