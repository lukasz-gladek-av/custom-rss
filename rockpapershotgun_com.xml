            <p>An online co-op mod for very French and very puppety soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been released in alpha form. As of writing, it'll let you take on boss battles with a friend and its creators are hoping to offer full multplayer playthroughs similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">seamless co-op mod</a> further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While the multiplayer mods of most FromSoft games are famously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">the work of modding savant Yui</a>, this Lies of P co-op add-on's been developed by a three person crew called Ember Wave. They've sunk "more than one year of reverse-engineering and systems development" into getting their project to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/368?tab=description">alpha release on Nexus Mods</a>, having shown off some progress via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbuROQ5LG5g">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmberWaveTeam">Patreon</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As of right now, the mod'll let you jump into boss fights across the base game and DLC - including the likes of the Scrapped Watchman, Nameless Puppet, and Arlecchino the Blood Artist - with one other player. So, duos for the moment, but the modders do note in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-mod-144752076">fresh Patreon FAQ</a> that they'll consider upping that limit as they overcome more technical hurdles.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see each other's health bars, spectate your partner via a special death cam if you fall, and be revived if they activate a stargazer. "You can mess around after killing a boss," the modders say, "but crashes might happen."</p><p>As for their next steps towards releasing the full co-op mode that'll allow seamless end-to-end playthroughs, the Ember Wave add that they "still need to sync world events (doors, elevators, quests, etc.) and fix a specific issue related to entering the Hotel, which causes unexpected behavior". So, that's on their plate going forwards, alongside nixing any major issues with the alpha release.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the alpha a go, you'll need to be running Windows 10 or 11 and have a Steam copy of Lies of P running <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1627720/announcements/detail/502836597467646578">September's version 1.12.0.0 update</a>. <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">Radmin VPN</a> is also required to "simulate a LAN connection" in order to host co-op sessions. Finally, if you want to battle DLC bosses, both players will need to own the DLC in question.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if this co-op mod for the boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn</a> dubbed "the closest we'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC, probably" can hit the complex heights of Yui's masterpieces when it reaches its final form. Until then, the modders'll no doubt keep on pulling marionette strings to see what they can accomplish.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell remake</a> has a new director who's served as its director before. David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft and take up the role he left when he departed the company in 2022, not long after being tapped as the remake's original director following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-have-stealth-announced-a-splinter-cell-remake">late 2021 announcement</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake," Grivel revealed in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU">LinkedIn post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/">GamesRadar</a>. "A very special team and project to me."</p>
<p>Grivel's return to the project follows a few years in which he's worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">now-shuttered studio Ridgeline Games</a>, briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto to work on the early stages of an unannounced project, then left to join NetEase-backed studio Worlds Untold. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">Worlds Untold then shut its doors</a> as he was transitioning into has job there, which sounds like a particularly horrible scenario to have faced.</p>
<p>With that road walked, the developer's now back at Ubi Toronto again, having spent 11 years there in the initial stint that ended with his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985690674448793600/">2022 departure</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> remake. During that time, he worked as a game designer on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, Primal, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>.</p><p>If you're wondering whether Grivel's return will see Ubisoft actually pull the covers off the Splinter Cell remake or provide an update as it how its development's going, the answer seems to be a no, at least for now. Things have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">very quiet on the game's front</a> since that initial 2021 reveal, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">potential teases</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-is-now-on-steam-but-youll-have-to-deal-with-some-ubisoft-faffage">Steam arrival of Pandora Tomorrow</a> having whipped up hopes. This arguably isn't out of character for a stealty sneakfest, but has left folks keen to splinter their cells without much of an idea how things are shaping up.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that with Grivel now back on board, we might at least get a brief morse code message about the state of the remake sometime soon. Otherwise, it'll be more gazing at Ubisoft from afar through tactical goggles, waiting to see if they pull the trigger on releasing the thing.</p>
