            <p>Right, it's that time again. Get ready to slide back down the ladder of powerfulness, because mandatory wipeage is required to stick everyone back on the same trajectory ahead of [insert new thing here]. No, say the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. They will not bow before the mandatory wipe gods at this time, instead trying out a voluntary wipe system dubbed Projects.</p>
<p>Yep, rather than leaning on the same unavoidable resets which plenty of extraction shooters and survival games employ to ensure newbies aren't always guaranteed to run into folks with more levels someone playing a platformer in a regularly-stopping elevator to the sun, Embark Studios plan to do their own thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins wrote in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">blog post</a> about wipes of the non-moist tissue variety.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method."</p><p>That method revolves around Projects, with the first one being dubbed the Expedition Project and unlocking upon hitting level 20. Once you complete it, you'll be given the option of a voluntary reset. The project'll run on a rotation lasting roughly eight weeks, and if you don't manage to complete it within that time, your progress towards doing so will roll over into the next eight week window. Embark say there's a "somewhat large time investment" involved to complete the project, so this move aims to ensure folks who don't have time to play as often aren't facing constant resets.</p>
<p>The likes of levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, and crafting capabilities will be wiped when you reset, while you'll keep the likes of cosmetics, awards, achievements, and rankings, with Embark making clear anything paid for with real money lands in the latter category. As such, the rewards for taking the rest bullet will be stuff like "permanent account unlocks", unique cosmetics to show off, and buffs to your account for the next Expedition Project window. The studio also teased the idea of other sorts of projects with different rewards being introduced down the line.</p>
<p>Whether this'll prove an ideal or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-was-delayed-so-much-because-of-a-surprisingly-simple-reason-not-even-its-devs-thought-it-was-fun">fun</a> approach remains to be seen, and Embark look to be hedging their bets. "It’s not a silver bullet, and won’t achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players," Watkins wrote. "Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do. Of course, this is a complex topic, so we’ll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and [will] follow up as necessary."</p>
<p>Personally, I hope it results in folks chanting 'wipe, wipe, wipe' over voice chat whenever foe deemed too powerful approaches, inflicting a form of peer pressure that happens to vaguely resemble someone trying to get over the final hurdle of toilet training a toddler.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, a group of former ZeniMax developers revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-microsofts-mass-layoffs-former-elder-scrolls-online-and-blackbird-devs-form-worker-owned-studio">formed a new worker-owned studio</a> in the aftermath of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. It's called Sackbird Studios, and the logo's a bird with a sack. Following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m2rx65rjlk2v">accusations that this bird looked like it could be AI-generated</a>, the studio have responded that it isn't, but some of the images on their website were.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kotaku's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3m2s4u4igjk2f">Ethan Gach</a> reached out to Sackbird amid questioning of their avian adumbration on social media. "Our trademarked logo was hand-drawn by a human artist working directly with the founding team," reads the response from a studio spokesperson. "Some supporting visuals on our website, like the Baltimore skyline and social icons, were generated with AI image tools and then customised and polished by us."</p>
<p>"At the time, we didn't have an artist on staff and were racing to meet a launch deadline, so AI helped us prototype quickly," they continued, adding that they don't view the controversial tech as "a replacement for artists", but rather "just another brush in the box". "The final look, humour, and heart are all Sackbird," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>It's certainly not a great look for the new studio, who'll rightly face strong scrutiny about use of AI going forwards. The aspect of the statement which has caught my attention is the idea Sackbird were racing to meet a launch deadline. Given how strongly the group emphasised being "fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games" in their launch press release, I'm struggling to see how that deadline can't have been self-imposed to at least some degree if the staff have the level of control they're suggesting.</p><p>That said, getting the ball rolling quickly on a new venture so you minimise any delays in re-establishing an income is at least understandable as a motivation, especially given the Sackbird team were recently laid off from their previous jobs. Whether that justifies leaning on AI, rather than ensuring that paid artists were employed or commissioned to handle every bit of art necessary to get through the all-important launch phase of your new studio is a judgement each of us'll have to make individually.</p>
