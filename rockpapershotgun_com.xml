            <p>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>s share something in common. Both (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a>’s Squall and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.</p>
<p>The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:</p>

<p>Gwent itself has seen a few iterations over the years. There was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">standalone online game</a> that I had some fun with for a bit, even if it shattered CDProjekt’s image as the ‘No Microtransactions, Free DLC and a Back Massage’ studio by having the most nefarious loot box animation I’d ever encountered. Then there was the rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-review">quite liked it</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the full press release <a href="https://www.hachetteboardgames.co.uk/gwent-announcement">here</a>, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year. In other Witchly news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has entered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"the most intensive phase of development</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
