            <p>A full-on remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2 was "technically on the road map" to follow the original Knights of the Old Republic remake which has been in development for the past few years. Well, that's at least the plan LucasFilm Games and co had as of March this year, with the KOTOR 2 remake's current status looking to be up in the air.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to court documents from earlier this year reported on by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">Game File</a> (paywalled) via <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-kotor-old-republic-2-remake-kotor-kotor2-lucasfilm-leak-court-docs-2000651434">Kotaku</a>. The docs, which saw Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly mention the KOTOR 2 remake in some depositions, relate to a false advertising lawsuit filed against the licensor and Aspyr over failing to deliver on integrating fan-made mod <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (TSLRCM) into KOTOR 2's Nintendo Switch port, as previously promised. Said lawsuit's since been settled.</p>
<p>As part of talking about that, Reilly revealed these plans for a full KOTOR 2 remake, confirming that it was codenamed Project Juliet. "Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR 2 with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of KOTOR 2, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things," he said. "It was something we were discussing with Aspyr."</p>
<p>Reilly described this KOTOR 2 remake as being "technically on the roadmap" to come out after the remake of the first game, and confirmed the plan was for it to remake the cut content included in the TSLRCM mod. That was the state of play as of these depositions in March. As for that status of the KOTOR 2 remake right now, Game File's Stephen Totilo reports having had radio silence in response to reaching out about where it's currently at.</p><p>To be fair, it'd be weird for a KOTOR 2 remake to be an open book, given the messy and often worryingly silent development path the remake of the first Knights of the Old Republic has endured thus far. Announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced">back in 2021</a>, it's since reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-doesnt-look-good-for-the-kotor-remake-again-as-reports-claim-its-not-being-worked-on-by-any-studio">feared to be cancelled</a>, then was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-at-least-two-people-are-reportedly-still-working-on-that-kotor-remake">worked on by at least two people</a>. Saber Interactive being sold off by Embracer Group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-release-left-in-limbo-by-saber-interactive-sale">cast fresh doubt</a> over the game, and the most recent update was Saber's CEO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-devs-insist-the-game-is-alive-and-well-after-their-split-from-embracer">declaring it "alive and well"</a> last April.</p>
<p>The court docs reveal's a good start, KOTOR 2 remake, but you've got a long way to go to catch up. Assuming you've not quietly gone the way of the dodo since March.</p>
