            <p>
Amazon have cancelled their second attempt at a Lord Of The Rings MMO as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">recent mass layoffs</a>, according to a now-former senior gameplay engineer at Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>. I've reached out to Amazon for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable.
</p>
<p>
Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">met an unfortunate end in 2021</a> thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023</a>, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a "persistent open-world MMO adventure", spanning the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project.
</p>
<p>
"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."
</p>
<p>
It's claimed that 14,000 people are losing their jobs as part of Amazon's latest cuts. Best of luck to everybody affected. At the risk of being twee, here is an encouraging aside from the books: "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."
</p><p>
If you're desperate to roam Middle-earth in company, Standing Stone and Daybreak's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> is still trucking along with a small but steady audience, almost two decades since launch. The community's recent doings include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom">finally accomplishing a pilgrimage of desperately underlevelled hobbits to Mount Doom</a>.

            <p>You can now retrieve Fargoth's ring and get in hot water for not-so-sneakily pilfering someone's sujamma in a mod which is aiming to port <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. This and more is shown off in the first update video the modder leading the charge has shared since first unveiling their impressive undertaking.</p>
<p>That initial reveal was about a month ago, when modder AnotherPlus lifted the Vvardenveil on the fact they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morrowind-is-being-ported-into-elden-ring-by-a-modder-complete-with-the-vast-army-of-goats-and-female-clones-vvardenfells-always-had">managed to transfer Morrowind's landscape across into the FromSoft game</a>. While there are still plenty of placeholders and bits in need of work, they and their team look to be making great progress thus far.</p>

<p>This update sees AnotherPlus show off some early quests which are now completeable, meaning you can step off the boat and start carving a path towards Dagoth Ur. I assume Dagoth, like all of the NPCs in the mod, is still a clone of a random Elden Ring lady with a computerised voice which can deliver his nice speeches.</p><p>"For those of you wondering about how far in the game you could actually get right now, I'm not sure, but fairly far, I'd imagine," the modder says. "The script compiler is not fully finished, but I have implemented a lot of the really common calls of the Papyrus language. So, you can actually do a lot of quests right now perfectly fine, but every once in a while, you'll run into a quest that requires a very specific Papyrus command that currently is a no-op and it just breaks."</p>
<p>The same sort of thing is true of the crime system the team have begun to implement. You can crouch to open up the option to nick items, with that being the way AnotherPlus has opted to go about things in order to avoid it being very easy to accidentally steal instead of initiating chats, and be hit with a bounty for doing so. However, guards currently don't have a jail to send you to and can't chase you outside of force-initiating shouty dialogue if you wander too close or turning hostile if you declare you're resisting arrest.</p>
<p>This is due to the lack of navmeshes, which AnotherPlus says is the sole challenge that they're really concerned about having the potential to stop them being able to get the mod working in full, adding that the team haven't made much progress on it so far. "That issue is currently our biggest roadblock," AnotherPlus explains. "In some ways, it's probably the only thing holding us back from finishing this project in the long term. It's the only thing on the project that I don't know what the solution is going to look like and there is a chance we just don't solve it." Though, they make clear they still believe it can be sorted.</p>
<p>Going forwards, the modders are looking for a number of extra volunteers to take on roles outlined at various points in the video. Possibly the most noteworthy of these is the need for some experienced Morrowind modders to step in and help create a compatibility patch that can reconcile the difference in how the two games handle integer values.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there's still no word on a release date or target, but AnotherPlus does hope to have another update video out relatively soon.</p>

            <p>
Once upon a time, the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh rose from his slumbers, scratched the opals from his beard of woven copper, and said to himself: "Today I will make a 3D egg platform game in which a 3D egg goes platforming, like my hit game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>, but 3D and with eggs." And because there was no-one around to say "WTF, Terry" or "perhaps you are just hungry" or "Mr Cavanagh, the egg's paucity of external appendages and senses wholly disallow it as a means of self-directed locomotion", that is exactly what he did. 
</p>
<p>
We are all the richer for it, because Egg (subtitle "why not be an egg") is eggcellent. It's also free and <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/egg">playable right now in a browser on Itch.io</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Where Cavanagh's early influences include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, in which there's a chapter that has you defending a giant condor egg against Shinra, I happen to be a graduate of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> University, which teaches that eggs are the work of Satanic industrialists. As such, I was profoundly suspicious of the egg platformer concept, but there is ample precedent: the Dizzy series (in which the egg has hands and feet), the shellshocked and yolk-crazed Billy the Hatcher, and the recent physics-me-do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2897610/Egging_On/">Egging On</a>. Sometimes when Sonic curls into a ball, I think that he looks rather like an egg. But then I close my eyes and bang my temples until the demons go away.
</p>
<p>
Cavanagh's Egg is both familiar of structure and tonally eggcentric. It puts you in charge of a supermarket box of six eggs, perched on a cliffside. Your job - I think, based on about 30 minutes with the game - is to control and guide the eggs one by one to a nest, somewhere in the landscape. It's possible there's a moral here about industrial poultry farming, but I don't want to bust out the <a href="https://kimstallwood.substack.com/p/the-sexual-politics-of-meat-by-carol">Carol Adams</a> just yet. I've succeggsfully guided just one egg to a "nest" so far. It slumbers now in a clump of frogspawn on a sandbank, deep underwater.
</p><p>
 The world is a stark, pixellated, precarious and arbitrary yet somehow consoling expanse of ledges and moving platforms and tunnels and whirling machinery, divided into discreet biomes that are linked by warp pipes. You move with WASD, look with the mouse, and jump with space, holding down the bar to charge up higher jumps.</p>
<p>It's a little fiddly, with lots of deadly drops, but not that punishing: checkpoints are plentiful, and you have infinite lives. Also, when you slide down a slope to a messy doom your egg makes a charmingly wibbly ooh-er noise. I think the eggs are all voiced by Cavanagh himself. Pretty sure Hideo Kojima has never voiced an egg.
</p>
<p>Who can explain the scrambled imaginings of the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh? It's possible <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/09/about-the-egg-game/">this blog post</a> might shed some light. Do a battery hen factory sim next, Terry.
