            <p>The year is 3025. Real life recieves a patch which renders you able to see every item you own with such fidelity that your eyes basically become microscopes. This is cool, your friend says, we're now only a little bit behind the level of detail <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have kitted out 2011's finest lizard yelling simulator with.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's inspired me to reach for my crystal ball, it's the emergence of yet another Skyrim mod which takes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> one step closer to featuring as many dynamically moving parts as our own reality. It allows folks across Tamriel to look at a calendar and decide they need a fresh hairdo without any input from your character, who's then left playing catch-up on all the new trims like a distant aunt at a family gathering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Modder JaySerpa's become a load order go-to for works like this which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">help make the game's world feel a lot less static</a>, and their latest mod's called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/161062?tab=description">Dynamic NPC Hairstyles</a>. "I love radiant story telling, I love when NPCs have a will of their own and I love when the world evolves as you play," they wrote. "These three concepts will go hand-in-hand as part of this mod."</p>
<p>So, they've created a system which'll automatically swap non-Argonian NPCs' hairstyles for another appropriate one with each change in the game's seasons. So, if you run into Mikael the bard from Whiterun, during Evening Star, he might have slightly bushier locks reflective of the need to keep warmer in the cold. Or, if you run into him during Sunâ€™s Height, he might be rocking a shorter chop to maximise the summer vibes. They're little changes, but done subtly like this, they're the sort of thing that can help spice up a long playthrough.</p>

<p>Hold up, you rightly declare, will this result in canonically bald or balding characters suddenly having their hairline bounce back in a fashion usually only afforded to vain 21st century businessmen? Fear not. Jayserpa's added in the option to make baldies automatically exempt so you're not risking having to rationalise things by pretending there's now a hair transplant clinic hidden in Riften's sewers. The modder's also deliberately left more out there hairstyles like mohawks out of the list used for the changes, so the switches won't be too drastic.</p><p>If you fancy, you can also make the likes of followers and Jarls exempt, which might help ensure compatibility with other mods. Meanwhile, some existing voice lines have been re-spliced to allow you to walk up to friendly characters and change their hairstyle manually, in case you don't think their fresh one suits them.</p>
<p>In order to get the mod working, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869?tab=files">Spell Perk Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121751">Hair Colour Sync</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63979">Vanilla Hair Remake</a> with its optional wigs file.</p>

            <p>There's a container. It needs to be moved. Get in this big crane thing and move it. That's the short and sweet summary of the Steam Next Fest demo for Docked, Saber Interactive's latest addition to their ever-expanding roster of simulations based around jobs which require high-vis gear.</p>

<p>Docked's laser-sharp focus on simulating the workings of a port means that, at least as far as its Next Fest demo is concerned, there's very little of the driving that characterises siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a>. You're not commuting, because all of your jobs are in and around Port Wake. Instead, Saber look to be aiming at the demographic of folks who've lived for the bits of their previous works which saw you given a crane and told to load some cargo onto your lorry, usually with a crane.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, this has never been where much of the appeal lies to me. Though, that might be because of my tendency to rush and end up having a bunch of logs escape to freedom. That said, if you're in it for the chance to get behind the complex controls of some heavy machinery, Docked's got you covered. The demo consists for four little jobs, with the first charging you to scale a colossal ship-to-shore crane, running around on foot as you fire it up. Once you're in, the act of moving containers off a damaged ship wasn't too far from what I've experienced in other Saber sims, but I did appreciate the change in pace that a bit of first-person climbing represented.</p><p>To be honest, that's where the demo peaks. The other jobs also revolve around moving containers, but this time with smaller vehicles. The straddle carrier you get to use last was my favourite of these, as it's a giraffe-esque contraption that drives astride containers to pick them up, which is wonderfully satisfying compared to the more mundane craneing of its cousin the reach stacker.</p>
<p>The menus suggest there'll be plenty of more in-depth port management in the full thing, but none of it's available just yet. That's a bit of a bummer, as I think for Docked to really catch on, it'll be the aspect of the game which has to do the most heavy lifting. Saber themselves have already put out plenty of games in which you can lift a thing using a big machine, but I can't think of too many games which put you in charge of a full port. It remains to be seen just how much there is to the upgrades and changes you'll be able to make to Port Wake, but since it seems likely to be the game's calling card, I'd hope the answer's plenty.</p>
<p>There's still no concrete release date to wait for right now, but you can both find Docked's Next Fest demo and wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/">Steam page</a>.</p>
