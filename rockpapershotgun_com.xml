The time is almost upon us all to prepare for the end of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and by end, I mean the RPG's final big update. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/larian-studios">Larian</a> cheekily shared last year that it'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors">one final hurrah</a> in spite of the fact they'd said that patch 7 would be the last major one. Now, in a quick little video posted to the official Larian YouTube channel yesterday, the developer confirmed that patch 8 will be dropping April 15th next week. There's even a special little livestream coming April 16th, 9am EST/ 2pm BST where senior systems designer Ross Stephens will be chatting about the game, alongside a look at the new patch.

It's also quite a doozy of an update! For starters, there's cross-play coming with this one meaning you'll be able to play with, well, anybody. There's also a photo mode coming with this game, something that'll really elevate Baldur's Gate 3 to the 2000s era dress-up game it deserves to be. Looks pretty in-depth too, lots of settings to fiddle around with, lots of ways to make your party members look even hunkier.

The biggest addition to the game is definitely all the new subclasses. There's one for each of the main classes, all of which come with new abilities, summons, cantrips, that sort of thing. Clerics will have access to the Death Domain subclass, for example, which comes with some new necromancy cantrips and spells. 
</p>
<p>
I quite like the look of the Wizard's Bladesinging subclass, which lets you use a sword to cast your spells, plus an ability that gives you "supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make."
</p>
<p>
Larian have said that there might be a few smaller updates to come, but in the meantime they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">cooking up something new</a>, whatever that is.
