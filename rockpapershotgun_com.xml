            <p>Gearbox have released another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update for technical problems on PC, with a particular focus on game stability and crashes, though they've also fixed a progression blocker or two in the process. Unlike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">that other Borderlands 4 patch</a> from earlier this week, this one has an actual changelog. Gosh, wait till Mark hears of this! Oh nuts, he's already gone on holiday, presumably in sheer consternation over the shortage of bullet points. Look what you did, Randy Pitchford. Look what you did.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"This update improves stability on PC, smooths out progression, and updates the Gilded Glory Pack loot and rewards for a more seamless experience," reads a note on the game's <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">official site</a>. "Please restart your game to ensure that the update goes through and to prevent connection errors in matchmaking."
</p>
<p>It follows the publication of our full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4 review</a>, in which Jasmine Mannan summarised the new looter-shooter as a good laugh despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">the lingering stink</a> over choppy frame rates and other technical gremlins. "With improved movement, devastating Action Skills that can be adjusted to suit your playstyle, and very limited Claptrap appearances, Borderlands 4 is easily the best Borderlands game yet," she wrote.
</p>
<p>As of 16th September, at least, Borderlands 4 had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psst-borderlands-4-has-a-pretty-broken-infinite-damage-build-and-it-may-soon-go-the-way-of-the-dodo">a build that let you melt bosses</a> by, as far as I can tell, replacing all of your enemy's major arteries with blackholes. I'm quite glad that Borderlands is a stylised, comicbook affair with bouncing damage numerals, because Mark's breakdown of that exploit is absolutely horrendous. I imagine they'll be patching that out pronto. </p><p>Anyway, here's the full changelog for the latest Borderlands 4 update. It is... brief, far too brief for bolded subheadings, really, but I added the first two before I noticed how slight it was, and I'm jiggered if I'm going to change course now.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Stability</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed crashes tied to animation states, audio, and collision checks</li>
<li>Addressed various GPU-related crashes</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gameplay &amp; Progression</strong>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Reward Center could stop working after claiming the Gilded Glory Pack rewards</li>
<li>Addressed a progression blocker in the mission "Talk to Zadra," where the objective could fail if players exited and relaunched mid-dialogue</li>
<li>Corrected "Doesn't own DLC" warnings incorrectly showing up on non-DLC gear</li>
<li>This will be fixed on consoles in the coming days.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Loot &amp; Items</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated loot pools so Gilded Glory Pack guns no longer appear in standard chests </li>
</ul></blockquote>
