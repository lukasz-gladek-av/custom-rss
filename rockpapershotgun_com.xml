            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-1-and-2-are-coming-back-to-pc-this-week-with-all-original-expansion-packs-says-report">rumoured</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">busy layoff schedule</a> to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of DLC. It's the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here's the reveal trailer.</p>

<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes the following DLC packs - sorry, just let me take a deep breath, OK let's go: The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/house-party">House Party</a>, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar, and The Sims Makin' Magic. You also get a bonus Throwback Fit Kit for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>.</p>
<p>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection, meanwhile, harbours the following - sorry, just let me preemptively hook myself up to a defibrillator. OK, here we go: The Sims 2: University, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sims-2-nightlife">The Sims 2: Nightlife</a>, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff. You also get a Grunge Revival Kit for The Sims 4.</p><p><em>Why</em> is there so much Sims 2 DLC? It's like some kind of Cambrian explosion of licensed boondoggles. I'm speaking from a position of blessed ignorance here. The only thing I know about The Sims 2 is that games journo extraordinaire Steve Hogarty once got blacklisted by EA for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/29gllx/the_sims_2_hm_fashion_stuff_review/">this PCZone review of the H&amp;M one</a>. I doubt his subsequent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-2-ikea-home-stuff-review/">review of an IKEA-themed pack</a> did much to heal the breach.</p>
<p>Find The Sims: Legacy Collection on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314060/The_Sims_Legacy_Collection/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/the-sims-legacy-collection">Epic Games Store</a>. Find The Sims 2: Legacy Collection also on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314070/The_Sims_2_Legacy_Collection/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/the-sims-2-legacy-collection">Epic Games Store</a>. Alternatively, grab them both in EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle/buy/pc">25th birthday bundle</a>. I leave the judging of whether they're priced appropriately to you, the discerning Simmer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros' licensed free-to-play fighting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> - aka, the one where Velma Dinkley and Arya Stark can team up to kick Superman's face in - will no longer be playable online as of 30th May. It'll be pulled from Steam, the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation and Xbox stores at the end of its next season, though you'll still be able to get your fill of Bugs Bunny bashing offline against either friends or bots.</p><!--more-->
<p>Season 5 is due to run from 4th February. It introduces DC's Aquaman and Looney Tunes's Lola Bunny - which, without wishing to rile up the Aquaman stans, strikes me as going out with a whimper. In-game real money transactions have been suspended as of today, but you have until 30th May to spend any in-game Gleamium currency or character tokens you already own. Players will be able to earn the new season 5 characters in-game: Aquaman is the first tier battlepass reward, while Lola is the daily calendar login reward.</p>
<p>They've put together a little guide to playing MultiVersus offline once the servers are pulled. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>All online features will continue to be available until Season 5 concludes on May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. At that point, there will be an option to play MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends. To do this, you'll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>As snarky as I may sound here, the RPS hivemind was reasonably keen on MultiVersus for a time. It once appeared on our lists of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">best free PC games</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">best co-op games</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">best multiplayer games</a>. You can still trace its presence there, clinging on determinedly by way of the article tags.</p><p>Writing about the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">back in July 2022</a>, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) summarised MultiVersus as follows: "learn to cut through its barrage of boxes and cooldowns, and you're left with a cracking fighting game that's only going to evolve over the coming months." Alas, no more.</p>
<p>It's not clear what all this means for developers Player First Games, who were acquired by Warner Bros last year. Warner's games division have not been in the pink lately, with Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">cratering</a> at launch and receiving its final update this month. As with MultiVersus, Rocksteady at least took the time to add an <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-now-officially-finished-as-its-final-update-goes-live/">offline mode</a> before calling it a night.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The post-launch update and DLC schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> slightly discombobulates me, because the image above is weirdly reminiscent of Civ 7's own historical Age progression screens. But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke "all roadmaps lead to Rome".* 
</p>
<p>
In case you missed it, the new 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445172204306615?l=english">a Steam post</a> which comments that the developers have "a seemingly endless list of ideas". I too have endless ideas - becoming an expert on toadstools, writing a feature film inspired by both Event Horizon and the Oresteia, inventing the Hammer of Dawn weapon from Gears Of War so that I can write evil slogans on my local football pitch, finishing this news post before 5pm. But as we all know, human beings are not endless, and it's possible some of the Civilization 7 team's grand plans won't come to fruition.
</p>
<p>
"The first set of updates we'll be providing are those that directly target the game as it currently stands," the Steam post comments. "There will be some bugs to fix, plenty of balance changes to make, and we know there are spots in the gameplay and user interface that can be enhanced with any number of quality-of-life improvements. You'll see regular updates from us in all of these areas."
</p>
<p>
Beyond these routine tune-ups, they're prioritising the below "features that didn't quite make it in for our initial launch". They don't have arrival dates, but there are definitely developers working on them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
- Adding Teams to multiplayer games so we can let you play cooperatively
</p>
<p>
- Expanding to 8 players for multiplayer in all Ages through refinements to our Distant Land system
</p>
<p>
- Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games
</p>
<p>
- Providing a wider variety of map types
</p>
<p>
- Adding in hotseat multiplayer
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The post also goes over some of the forthcoming paid additions to the forthcoming nation-nurser. They'll be grouped into themed "content collections" that encompass new leaders, civilisations and wonders of the world - all to be released "over the course of a few months" rather than in one dollop.
</p><p>
The first of these boutique-sounding groupings is the Crossroads of the World collection, which will roll out in March 2025. It'll arrive in two doses, the first of which includes "long-standing favourites" Carthage and Great Britain, plus the new leader Ada Lovelace, "who has a way of mastering a game world unlike any other". Some sort of analog AI revolution, perhaps? The second Crossroads of the World drop adds Simón Bolívar and the all-new civs Bulgaria and Nepal.
</p>
<p>
The full Steam post also discusses the game's victory types, and how they mesh with the new Age system. It's been a while since I properly played Civ - I think Civ 5 was the last one I really sold my soul to. I'm curious to see how Ages change things in practice, though I am disappointed to learn that the new 4X makes use of ye scurvy Denuvo DRM.
