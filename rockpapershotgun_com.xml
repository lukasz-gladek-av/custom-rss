It's really quite interesting how, in a time where big budget live service games are doing anything they can to get you to continue playing (and importantly spend money on) them, the sort of spiritual opposite of this to rise out of this are games where you just hang out with a few buds doing silly nonsense that don't cost very much. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, Peak, you know the kinds of games I mean, and yesterday a new one I quite like the look of arrived: RV There Yet?
</p>
<p>
First of all, kudos on the naming there, developer Nuggets Entertainment, just an all timer of a pun. In RV There Yet?, you and a few other friends play as what I can only describe as "the kind of guy who thinks going on a camping trip with an RV out in the middle of nowhere is a good time." The concept is quite simple: your vacation is over, you're trying to drive home, but, uh oh, the route you took is closed, so you have to find another way back, and hijinks ensue!

That might mean doing the very dad core thing of getting out of the RV and pushing or pulling the air to suggest you need to reverse or move forward, replacing a tire, smoking a cigarette, using a pulley system to lift up your RV, fighting off a wolf, grilling frozen meat patties, putting on a cassette tape with some age inappropriate tunes. Dad core stuff! Not to mention the most important core feature, "hats."
</p><p>
It's possible that RV There Yet? ends up as another log in the friendslop fire, but I do find it interesting to see the ways that the core concept of "four friends goofing around" has been explored. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">Multiplayer</a> games typically don't appeal to me due to their frequently competitive nature, and while I don't have time for every single collaborative co-op game under the sun, it's nice to see online games opting for a different approach. Like Peak before it, RV There Yet? was a made during a game jam, once again showing you how limitations can often lead to some neat results.
