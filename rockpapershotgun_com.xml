<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is getting a Tarnished Edition on Switch 2, but you are an enlightened individual who cares not for Switchery - why else would you be reading RPS, a website dedicated to PCs, the very best console of all? Are you some kind of Nintendo fan-enthusiast-zealot, here to gloat about the fact that the Tarnished Edition is a Switch 2 exclusive? 
</p>
<p>
Is that what you think? Well if that <em>is</em> what you think, I've got something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows: I'm not wearing a tie at all! I mean, the Tarnished Edition's new stuff is almost guaranteed to turf up on PC at some stage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Catch the trailer for the Tarnished Edition below. It's out on the Switchbox in 2025, and includes the original open world action-RPG and last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> expansion, which Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">described</a> as "basically a sequel" and "a knotty, dense expansion that's home to some of the best moments in Elden Ring, but also some of its most frustrating."

You should notice a few new pieces of armour and equipment. There's one that resembles Lucatiel of Mirrah's gear from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>. The biggest addition, so far, is a new customisation feature for Torrent, your summonable spectral steed. The trailer treats us to a few glimpses of a saddle with flapping red banners.</p>
<p>According to a press release from publisher Bandai Namco, "the additional content in the title will also be available on other platforms". I know, it doesn't specifically mention PC, but come on. Why would PC not be included among "other platforms". Denying us this would be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">denying us a spiritual Bloodborne sequel</a>, before we've even got a PC port of the first game.</p>
<p>I will keep my eyes peeled for Steam updates. In the meantime, you might want to check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, a co-op multiplayer spin-off in which three players farm maps for upgrades in order to fight a series of bosses.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enter-the-gungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a> feels like one of those quintessential indie games right? It came out almost a decade ago way back in 2016, which felt like the peak "indie games are here and they can go toe to toe with the big boys" era. It had all the hallmarks, like throwback pixel art, quirky designs, easy to pick up and put down. So it feels a bit funny to see that a sequel, quite aptly titled Enter the Gungeon 2, was revealed during a presentation for, what was it called now, the Nintendo Switch 2? Something like that, doesn't matter, point is: Dodge Roll are making a sequel, and yes, it is coming to PC too, don't you worry.

I think its first, very short trailer (seriously, only 30 seconds, can't blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> for not wanting to cough up cash for a longer one) is a bit funny too, in that the game is 3D now. This isn't a knock on how the game looks, I think the style has been translated very well between dimensions, that giant enemy made up of tinier lil bullet guys speaks to me. But it really does show you how much the industry has changed in a decade when an iconic indie like Enter the Gungeon makes a switch like this.

The trailer didn't reveal all that much honestly, it really does look like the game but in 3D, and it is still a bullet hell, action, roguelike game. Over on Steam it says that you'll "battle through areas familiar and unknown", and that there'll be an "expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon." 
</p>
<p>
There's no release date to be found just yet, so another classic case of "this exists, we'll see you when we see you." Fair enough! Anyway, congrats Enter the Gungeon fans, you're doing better than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Bloodborne for PC crowd</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</a> isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/astroneer">Astroneer</a> 2, so don't worry if you were as fond of the spacey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game as Alec Meer (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-astroneer">was back in 2019</a>. "Slowly asphyxiating to death in an unforgiving alien wasteland has never been so joyful", wrote he, reminding me of the over air-fried chicken nugget I got stuck in my throat last week. The original Astroneer will keep receiving updates for "years" to come, say developers System Era Softworks. As for Starseeker, it's aiming to be a different kettle of space entirely.</p>

<p>It's doing that through the power of mates, chiefly. Not just a few mates, but many. Mates squared. "Exploring deep space on the ESS Starseeker, players will need to work together with the entire crew of the space station," say System Era, "to complete planet-wide objectives across a multitude of star systems using cutting edge technology". Alec called the original's tone more "Vengaboys than 65daysofstatic" (them what did music for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>), and it definitely all seems far more bubbly and chipper than your garden variety forage-for-dysentry-berries-or-die-in-poverty 'em up. Labour's new fifteen point berries-or-poverty plan being what it is, I'm thankful for the escapism.</p>
<p>A "focus on discovery, cooperative expeditions, and camaraderie" is the vibe here. "Players will have an advanced set of tools at their disposal to tackle expeditions while they face off with the unknown perils of space- - fascinating creatures, hazardous flora, and mysterious forces that await them".</p>
<p>This'll all be done from your space station, the titular ESS Starseeker - "an ever-evolving space station where players get together to plan expeditions, upgrade their capabilities, and even hang out with other players".</p>
<p>The devs promise livestreams, vlogs, a limited beta, and a more in-depth gameplay trailer all over the coming months. You can find Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/">on Steam here</a>, and it's due for release 2026. I'm actually not being glib when I say I hope there's a way to talk to these monsters, they look ace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
