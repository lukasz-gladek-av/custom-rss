            <p>Colourful story-driven adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">To a T</a> is a new game from the studio of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi. You play as an eternally T-posing teenager who must learn how to get by performing the simple tasks of life despite the challenge of having their arms permanently outstretched. We first learned about the game back in 2023, when it was announced with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">very sing-alongable trailer</a>. Now, it has a release date, along with another cracking musical number. Come watch.</p>

<p>Ah, that's good. The game will come out May 28th, we're told. Besides having some friendly tunes, the trailer also shows off other features of the game, including some we haven't seen until now. You can customise your Teen's appearance, for example, and pick out shirts and shoes to wear. There's a dance sequence, teeth-brushing, dog petting, and some casual unicycling. </p>
<p>Outside the episodic story and minigames, you'll also be exploring the teen's hometown, visiting the shops, and chatting to other inhabitants eg. a giant talking pigeon wearing headphones. The teen also discovers the power to spin round incredibly fast and soar into the sky like a helicopter. We have seen that one previously, but yes, it seems useful. </p>
<p>The game is being developed by Uvula, the studio led by Keita Takahashi, designer of kid-friendly games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenya-wanya-teens">Tenya Wanya Teens</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wattam">Wattam</a>, and Noby Noby Boy (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_TVzFVZbl4">chaotic spaghetti 'em up</a> that sadly never came to PC). They're generally colourful, playful, and approachable games about movement and silliness. This game's theme of going through everyday life as a kid with a disability means that the studio also consulted with charity AbleGamers about the subject, and want to make sure actually playing the thing is accessible.</p>
<p>Fun fact about Keita Takahashi: he was once <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/games/japanese-games-designer-recruited-to-design-nottingham-playground-1810807.html">hired by Nottingham city council to design a playground</a>. In the end, the park was cancelled because of budget concerns, so we never got to see his wild garden of trampolines and catapults. But sometimes I still think about what <a href="https://x.com/zerofiftyone_/status/1431042842378608642?lang=en">his happy doodles</a> might have looked like in real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The release dates for an upcoming expansion pack for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> have seemingly leaked via the Nintendo Store. The first part of the Crossroads Of The World collection, slated for "early March" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">in the official roadmap</a>, is indeed listed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iz5ehp/the_release_dates_for_both_upcoming_expansions/">the leaked image</a> as due on March 4th, 2025, with the second part due on March 25th - lining up with the roadmap's "late March".</p>
<p>Specifically, March 4th brings three separate items: the Ada Lovelace, Carthage, and Great Britain packs. On the 25th of the month, they'll be joined by Simon Bolivar, Bulgaria, and Nepal.</p>
<p>The are some discrepancies on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-VII-2637632.html#dlcItems">the UK Nintendo store</a>, however, with the release dates for each of the packs from the first set also listed as 25/03/2025. </p>

<p>These are all part of a single <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII_Crossroads_of_the_World_Collection/">Steam store item</a>, released in two parts over the course of the month. The Crossroads Of The World expansion also includes the 'wonder pack', which includes the Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca natural wonders. Based on the current Steam reviews, I gather it was part of some sort of super shiny edition or other, but looking at edition versions makes my back and soul ache these days.</p>
<p>"A mostly successful effort to address major criticisms of previous Civilization games," reckoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Greg Costikyan in his review for RPS</a>. "with some drawbacks and terrible combat UX."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
