            <p>
For a myriad of reasons, I can't really write any particular profane curse words here, but an approximation of my feelings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdcage">Birdcage</a>, an anime as hell, "sword action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> game", it would be something like, "this game is so ******* sick, like what the ****, how the **** can one game be so ******* stylish." I'm sure you can fill in the blanks of what words I wish I could use there, but if you'll allow me, I'd also like to take the time to actually talk about why Birdcage rules so much.
</p>
<p>
Birdcage is an upcoming title from Polygon Bird Games, which consists of just two people: Giannis Milonogiannis, a comic book artist who's worked with big dogs like DC and Marvel, and Barry Topping, the composer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-killer">Paradise Killer</a>. Milonogiannis is behind all the art from the game, which is just a perfect concoction of moods and influences, coming through tightly in its recently released demo (<strong><em>big flashing lights warning</em></strong>).

<p>
Inspired by '90s arcade games, Birdcage's opening cutscenes feel just as sparse yet tantalising as the best of them. You are the pilot of a ship called the Halycon, with one goal in mind: destroy a new kind of weapon that will "end Earth's reign and birth a new universe, the World-Egg." This is delivered to you in single screen scenes with art that evokes the best JRPG classics - think a sketchier, more pixel arty Breath of Fire 4 cover kind of vibe.
</p><p>
It's the kind of game you can imagine getting an OVA straight-to-VHS adaptation that's worth $300 now and has not been released in high quality, so your only way to watch it is through a crappy rip uploaded to the Internet Archive. The story in the demo is minimal, and there's only six stages apparently, but the restraint exercised makes me curious for more, the best kind of narrative.
</p>
<p>
With your ship, you have a few combat options. You can shoot out a spread of bullets that do less damage but hit more enemies, or you can concentrate them to do more damage, the tradeoff being that you move slower (which turns into a boon in more bullet laden levels). Said ship also has a sword, a point that rules an incredible amount, that can destroy certain bullet types, can be swung around to damage certain ships, or shot out at an enemy. It's all mostly simple, yet tough as hell. You've only got three bits of health, and limited lives, so dodging every bullet is a lot more stressful than you'd think.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's an arcade mode which is just story mode without the story, and score attack where enemies infinitely spawn within a set time limit as you try to rack up some points. Real classic arcade stuff.
</p>
<p>
You can try out the demo for yourself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158550/BIRDCAGE/">Steam</a> right now, or alternatively, you can wait until November 18th for the full release.

The Nintendo Dual Screen! Or Nintendo DS, as it was actually known. There's a console that has practically no relevance to this site, except for right now, because of a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dementium-the-ward">Dementium: The Ward</a>. For those that haven't heard of it, this is one of the incredibly few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games available on the handheld console, nowadays a bit of a cult classic because who on earth thought it would be a good idea to do that. It was also pitched as a Silent Hill game, a point we'll come back to because the big thing here is that it's making its way to Steam later this month.
</p>
<p>
Here's the concept: you wake up in a hospital, you've got no memories, and there's nasty monsters you have to defend yourself from. On the original DS, you had to use the touch screen to look around, and you needed to use the D-Pad to move. This obviously sounds like a bit of a tricky control scheme, though it looks like it'll be your standard first-person affair in the PC release. One thing in the DS' favour that will be missing however is that you could also write down notes in a notebook using the touchscreen.

<p>
I do wonder if these changes will rob the game of something. It's not a completely new port, the game is already available on Switch and PS4/PS5, so these changes have already taken place, but I question if the lack of friction from the finicky sounding DS controls makes the experience flatter. Though, I do appreciate that it's generally retained its original visuals. Death to revisionist remasters!
</p><p>
Anyway, that Silent Hill connection! A few years back Jools Watsham, the co-founder of Renegade Kid, developer of Dementium, shared that the studio had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/dementium-the-ward-was-pitched-to-konami-as-a-silent-hill-ds-game">pitched the game to Konami about making it a Silent Hill entry</a>. According to Watsham, Konami were "kind enough to meet with us, but the meeting only lasted a few minutes and ended with their [representative] saying they wouldn't let a team like us handle the Silent Hill license." Rough! But looking at Dementium, even if it is a cult classic, it's probably for the best ultimately.
</p>
<p>
Mostly I think this thing is a neat little curiosity, as it's not very often you see DS games ported off of the console given the complexity of adapting dual screen gameplay. Normally you get remakes like The World Ends With You. In any case, if you're interested in picking up the seasonally appropriate Dementium: The Ward, it's due out later this month on October 27th via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3909960/Dementium_The_Ward/">Steam</a>.
