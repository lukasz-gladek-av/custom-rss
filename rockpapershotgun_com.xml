        <p>Yes, every Peak headline I write will contain the same pun</p>

            <p>Well, after a prolonged period of teasing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games look to have bitten the human bullet. Nestled among the notes for the climbing game's latest patch are the words "added cannibalism".</p>
<p>It's not enough that you can mod Peak so that you and your buddies will be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">surrounded by the corpses of fallen climbers</a> as you attempt to do an Edmund Hillary. The folks behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> want you to casually nibble on your colleagues on the way.</p>

<p>"Fine," the devs wrote on the smouldering remains of the Tweeter as they deployed patch 1.10.a, which allows you to eat people. The notes don't provide any more details as to how this cannibalism works, but I assume you just walk up to a fellow mountaineer, politely ask permission, and then start munching away.</p>
<p>Maybe don't start with the feet. That advice isn't based on any previous experiences I've had in real life, I assure you. Looking <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aggrocrabgames.bsky.social/post/3luil6jpkzs2a">directly into their eyes</a> as you devour their elbows probably isn't a good idea either.</p> <div>

<p>Aside from the whole eating people thing, this Peak patch adds in a new setting called "Climbing Extra Field Of View", which lets you control how the FOV changes as you climb, and a push to mute button that I was going to accuse of being a means by which to silence cannibalism objectors until I realised it works like reverse push to talk. Polish and Turkish language support has also arrived.</p>
<p>Fittingly for a cannibalism update, a few food and cooking-related balancing tweaks have been made, including one that stops well-done snacks from being de-buffed if you stash them away for later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch of bug and performance fixes, with the devs having dealt with some wildflowers and temporarily disabled the Napberry plant in a bid to help things run better. They've also had a go at nixing a bug that leads you to take a "significant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance", but it seems their temporary solution has only addressed instances of this that involve "sliding down while holding the wall", so efforts are ongoing.</p>
<p>Digest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498327923676161391">the full notes</a> if you want the rest. Well, unless you're saving space for a buddy you plan to devour on the way to the summit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s patch 1.02, which'll deliver the Duo Expeditions players have been asking for, has had its deployment pushed back by a day due a tsunami warning.</p>
<p>The update was orginally set to go out today, July 30th, but will now go out tomorrow, July 31st. The tsunami warning that's led developers FromSoftware to have to switch up their plans is one of many consequences of a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>FromSoft announced the change via a Twitter post, penning the patch in to go out at after 9AM BST / 4AM ET / 1AM PDT/ 10AM CEST on the 31st. The beginning of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-enhanced-boss-wave-crashes-against-the-shores-of-frustration-at-the-end-of-this-month">second cycle of Everdark Sovereigns</a>, the enhanced bosses that the devs have been releasing into the game on a weekly rotation, has also been pushed back until after the patch has gone live.</p>
<p>Aside from that Duos mode, which FromSoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">committed to delivering</a> not long after the multiplayer Soulsperience debuted, patch 1.02 is set to include the likes of UI tweaks and more relic filtering options.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT.</p>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Japan's one of a number of countries which have been forced to issue tsunami warnings and evacuation orders following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t">8.8 magnitude earthquake hitting eastern Russia</a> in the early hours of this morning UK time. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t?post=asset%3A5003b4cf-79bb-4456-beb8-8df0e593fd55#post">Reportedly one of the strongest earthquakes ever on record</a>, its aftermath has seen coastal areas in Russia, the western US states, Hawaii, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, Colombia and Japan prepare for potentally dangerous waves, as the shock ripples out across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>More than 1.9 million people have been asked to evacuate in Japan, the BBC report, with the country's meteorological agency estimating that tsunami waves could reach up to three metres high.</p>
<p>Here's hoping everyone in the affected places can stay safe.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning]]></content:encoded>
