            <p>
There is certainly something to be admired in Peter Molyneux's commitment to infinitely overpromising right through to what is meant to be his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneuxs-final-game-masters-of-albion-will-release-in-april-its-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work">final game</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>. I'm not saying I admire it, but someone might. And while I truly have no horse in the race regarding the quality, or potential lack thereof, in Masters of Albion, its latest gameplay trailer certainly does at least suggest it'll be a true as it can be Molyneux game.
</p>
<p>
If you're already clued into the impending release of 22cans' latest, you'll know that it's a little bit of all of Molyneux's releases, mainly leaning towards his god games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a> and the unsubtly titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/godus">Godus</a>. There's also quite clearly a dash of Fable, all of which is neatly shown off in the aforementioned new gameplay trailer. Namely, it shows off the manner of ways you have to attend to your little slice of the world.

<p>
For example, a very Bri'ish man might appear from a mine, requesting a sword from you, a floating omnipotent hand, which you can then go build yourself bit by bit, from hilt to tip. Get that made, get it delivered, and off he goes to try and take down some nasties. Then, you might kidnap a random man and put him in some armour you designed before literally becoming him and entering the mine yourself, switching between the birds-eye view to a third-person, actiony one.
</p><p>
And then that gets interrupted by some evil zombie things, you become a hand again, you switch back and forth between god mode, essentially playing a tower defense game, and that third-person combat. It's all very "wow, isn't this so cool, you can be anyone, but also God!" Which, sure, it definitely is the kind of game a nine year old would come up with and not realise that in actuality it just comes across as a bit pointless. The spirit is there, at least, and that childlike quality is maybe even a bit charming.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, none of us have to wait particularly long to be pleasantly surprised / condescending and annoying about it being bad, as it's due out April 22nd this year. You can, if you like, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">check it out on Steam</a>.

            <p>
Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lil-gator-game">Lil Gator Game</a> arrived in the forgotten year of 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lil-gator-game-review">it received RPS' coveted Bestest Bests badge</a> because, well, it was just so darn delightful! And in the years since, developer MegaWobble have been tinkering away at a seemingly Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom influenced bit of DLC. Which, as it just so happens, has just been released today!
</p>
<p>
For the intrepid adventurer who knows no fear, this DLC, titled In the Dark, sees the titular gator head into an entirely underground - and still wonderfully whimsical looking - underground area that apparently doubles the size of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a>. That's good to hear too, as the original was a touch short, so it's nice to have an even bigger playground to romp around in. Much like Tears of the Kingdom, it appears that each of the new underground areas have an underground counterpart, like one where there's a giant tree above ground, and its lengthy roots below.

<p>
There's also a few new items to find, like a gymnastic ribbon that allows for double jumps. A few new weapons appear to have been added in too, like a lance that lets you dash forward in the air, and a pickaxe for busting up boulders. You'll of course find some other very friendly critters to help out, although there'll be some troublesome teens - such as a pig called Darklord and a bear called Ruth, which doesn't feel particularly proportionate - to contend with this time round.
</p><p>
The DLC is also at a nice healthy 30% off until February 26th, which certainly isn't anything to complain about in this economy. So, if you're looking for an injection of something just a bit lovely, you can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205060/Lil_Gator_Game_In_the_Dark/">here</a>.
