            <p>True to the game's billing as the twistiest of duty-shooters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release date trailer appears to have leaked ahead of a possible <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> showing tonight. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will launch on 14th November, close to a month after rival Battlefield 6's release on October 10th. Also, it appears to have jet packs and mechs.</p><!--more-->
<p>The leak comes care of that ever-dependable source of military intelligence, a video advertisement that seems to have been accidentally published early. The ad has now been removed, but not before CharlieIntel spotted it and shared it on the Xeetbox, along with some <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957614174768689197?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">thoughts based on the user's own pre-release access</a>. "Just to tone down expectations, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 does not have jet packs or double jumps as part of its movement," CharlieIntel claims. Alas for Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a> players. Good news, I guess, for people who relish the 'omnimovement' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what we know of Call of Duty: Bleven for sure: it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">requires secure boot, to avoid cheaters</a>. It's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>. The campaign is set in 2035, hence the mechs and jet packs, and expands upon the global calamities unleashed in Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. It sees grizzly grumbleface David Mason chasing after an enigmatic new foe who "weaponise fear". There will probably be hallucinations and other Manchurian Candidate-esque horseplay to wash down the gadgets and gunnery.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-black-ops-7-video-features-mechs-jet-packs-and-a-release-date/">reported by VGC</a>, today's release date whoopsie corroborates a previous leak that also included a price tag for the Standard Edition - $70 or €80 - with a Vault Edition priced at $100 or €110. If legit, this means that Microsoft has still yet to cross the Rubicon and raise the game's base US price to $80, as they tried to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">until the internet started screaming at them</a>.</p>
