            <p>
A new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> update has made various adjustments to the fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s movement and so, restarted the inexhaustible debate as to what manner of jank is 'good' jank.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Posting in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/506195909797741132?l=english">their latest dev roadmap</a>, creators Yellow Brick acknowledge complaints about protagonist Brynn's motions feeling a bit slippy-slidey, particularly when accelerating or decelerating or being struck by an object. "Some of you described that her walking/running felt a little bit too much like 'skating' and that the lack of precision could be frustrating at times," they write.
</p>
<p>
That slipperiness is sort of the aim, however. Eternal Strands is broadly a Dragon Adjacent physics sandbox, with objects you can lob about with your legally distinct Jedi mind tricks, and elemental gimcrackery such as freezing and combustion. Brynn's character model doesn't stand aloof from all that - while she has more capacity to direct the proceedings, she's also basically another child in the ballpit.
</p>
<p>
 "Something to note about Brynn's movement is that much of how it feels is intended and attributable to how a 100% physics-based sandbox game like Eternal Strands is designed to work," the post goes on. "Being an object that reacts to the physics surrounding her, just like any other object in the world, means that her weight and inertia have an impact on her movement." 
</p>
<p>
They are, however, trying to find some common ground with the detractors. Difficult to find common ground when you're coasting about like a seal, I guess, but it definitely sounds like change for the better. As of today, Bryn's "minimum acceleration speed has been enhanced". Following the next update "reaching a target speed or slowing down to a full stop will happen quicker" to avoid the impression of sliding, though if you're lightly clad and equipped there will stil be a touch of "skating". Furthermore, "direction changes will be much 'snappier'."
</p>
<p>
Occasionally eccentric handling notwithstanding, Eternal Strands has found a following on Steam. While our own reviewer Sophie Glass <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eternal-strands-review">noted its "janky controls"</a>, she also pointed out that it's the work of a small team, and described it overall as "consistently surprising and enjoyable".
</p>
<p>
In particular, Sophie highlighted "the lovely improvised chaos of physics systems bumping into each other", adding that "every time I get flung directly into the sky, or a triceratops thing mistimes its own attack and slams a rock the size of a piano into its own face, I am filled with the wild joy of being alive."
</p>
<p>
Personally, I like games in which the physics often betray you. Many are the laughs I have had while accidentally judo-throwing myself in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>. I'm also fond of how Eternal Strands harkens back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psi-ops-the-mindgate-conspiracy-retrospective">a sillier age of video game telekinesis</a>, long before Control came along and made it all seem so stylish.

            <p>Late last week, former Striking Distance concept art director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">Jesse Lee took to LinkedIn</a> to reminisce on their time at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio. "Thinking back to the very beginning of Striking Distance Studios, to today - nearly six years later. Most of the devs were laid off, and it is hard to sum it all up right now," wrote Lee.</p>
<p>The layoffs were confirmed this week in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement from parent company Krafton to PC Gamer</a>, which you can find below. Apologies for spoiling anyone's game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">official statement bingo</a> but, yes, it contains the word "agile".</p>

<p>"Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development," a Krafton representative told PC Gamer. "The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time."</p>
<p>Several other former employees spoke about losing their jobs alongside Lee. "It was a tough morning at Striking Distance," said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a/">animation director Zach Volker</a>, "lots of layoffs, including myself. It was a great ride and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I had to lead the charge on multiple projects and for the new relationships I've built." Cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">was also impacted</a>.</p>
<p>It feels telling of LinkedIn's culture (and the nature of finding more work in a precarious landscape) that many layoff posts are often accompanied by similar expressions of gratitude and eagerness. It's terrible enough to lose your job through no fault of your own, let alone for a culture (or some cowardly NDA) to discourage or deny you the catharsis of expressing anger and grief for fear of being seen as difficult or not adequatedly cosplaying nebulous notions of 'professionalism' - not that I can know how the affected developers genuinely feel.</p>
<p>This isn't the first round of layoffs at Striking Distance, either, following 32 employees <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-hit-by-lay-offs-for-32-employees">let go in August of 2023</a>. "Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success," said Krafton at the time. Back in January of that year, more than 20 staff alleged they had been omitted from the game's credits. "We're talking full-time employees with over a year invested in the title, and had a hand in significant parts of the product," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/callisto-protocol-developers-left-out-of-credits">one source told Gamesindustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>The Callisto Protocol's director Glen Schofield left the studio around the same time as the 2023 layoffs. Striking Distance followed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> with roguelike spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a> released last October, which reached an all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam of 169, note PC Gamer.</p>
<p>This news follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">closures at Warner Bros</a> including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor</a> studio Monolith, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">rumours of more slashing and burning</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> owners NetEase.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Colourful story-driven adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">To a T</a> is a new game from the studio of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi. You play as an eternally T-posing teenager who must learn how to get by performing the simple tasks of life despite the challenge of having their arms permanently outstretched. We first learned about the game back in 2023, when it was announced with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">very sing-alongable trailer</a>. Now, it has a release date, along with another cracking musical number. Come watch.</p>

<p>Ah, that's good. The game will come out May 28th, we're told. Besides having some friendly tunes, the trailer also shows off other features of the game, including some we haven't seen until now. You can customise your Teen's appearance, for example, and pick out shirts and shoes to wear. There's a dance sequence, teeth-brushing, dog petting, and some casual unicycling. </p>
<p>Outside the episodic story and minigames, you'll also be exploring the teen's hometown, visiting the shops, and chatting to other inhabitants eg. a giant talking pigeon wearing headphones. The teen also discovers the power to spin round incredibly fast and soar into the sky like a helicopter. We have seen that one previously, but yes, it seems useful. </p>
<p>The game is being developed by Uvula, the studio led by Keita Takahashi, designer of kid-friendly games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenya-wanya-teens">Tenya Wanya Teens</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wattam">Wattam</a>, and Noby Noby Boy (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_TVzFVZbl4">chaotic spaghetti 'em up</a> that sadly never came to PC). They're generally colourful, playful, and approachable games about movement and silliness. This game's theme of going through everyday life as a kid with a disability means that the studio also consulted with charity AbleGamers about the subject, and want to make sure actually playing the thing is accessible.</p>
<p>Fun fact about Keita Takahashi: he was once <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/games/japanese-games-designer-recruited-to-design-nottingham-playground-1810807.html">hired by Nottingham city council to design a playground</a>. In the end, the park was cancelled because of budget concerns, so we never got to see his wild garden of trampolines and catapults. But sometimes I still think about what <a href="https://x.com/zerofiftyone_/status/1431042842378608642?lang=en">his happy doodles</a> might have looked like in real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The release dates for an upcoming expansion pack for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> have seemingly leaked via the Nintendo Store. The first part of the Crossroads Of The World collection, slated for "early March" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">in the official roadmap</a>, is indeed listed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iz5ehp/the_release_dates_for_both_upcoming_expansions/">the leaked image</a> as due on March 4th, 2025, with the second part due on March 25th - lining up with the roadmap's "late March".</p>
<p>Specifically, March 4th brings three separate items: the Ada Lovelace, Carthage, and Great Britain packs. On the 25th of the month, they'll be joined by Simon Bolivar, Bulgaria, and Nepal.</p>
<p>The are some discrepancies on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-VII-2637632.html#dlcItems">the UK Nintendo store</a>, however, with the release dates for each of the packs from the first set also listed as 25/03/2025. </p>

<p>These are all part of a single <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII_Crossroads_of_the_World_Collection/">Steam store item</a>, released in two parts over the course of the month. The Crossroads Of The World expansion also includes the 'wonder pack', which includes the Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca natural wonders. Based on the current Steam reviews, I gather it was part of some sort of super shiny edition or other, but looking at edition versions makes my back and soul ache these days.</p>
<p>"A mostly successful effort to address major criticisms of previous Civilization games," reckoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Greg Costikyan in his review for RPS</a>. "with some drawbacks and terrible combat UX."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
