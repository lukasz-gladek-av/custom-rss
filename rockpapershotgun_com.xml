            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> games were some of the first non-FromSoft Soulslikes to find their own audience, probably in part because they're not really Soulslikes at all. They're Team Ninja action RPGs, drawn from their wellspring of experience making such games, and despite Nioh's 2017 release date, it spawned from a project that began development all the way back in 2004, firmly pre-Souls.
</p>
<p>Why all the preamble, rather than getting straight into the news? Well, because the news is in the headline: Nioh 3 was just announced at this evening's State Of Play. Once again it looks like it's coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, with no PC release in sight.

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, Nioh 3 contains larger open areas to be explored, as well as new "ninja style" combat mode. It's due for release sometime in 2026, but if you've got a PlayStation 5, there's a demo you can play right now.
</p>
<p>The original Nioh launched on PlayStation 4 in February 2017 and was available on PC by November of the same year. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a> took a little longer, arriving on PS4 in March 2020 and on PC (and PlayStation 5) in February 2021. It seems a safe bet to assume Nioh 3 will make the leap to PC as well, but it's a shame that we'll have to wait yet again.
</p>
<p>This evening's State Of Play brought plenty news of games we won't need to wait for, including trailers for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Capcom's Pragmata</a> and IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, which are both launching simultaneously across platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
