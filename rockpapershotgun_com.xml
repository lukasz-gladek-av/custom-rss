            <p>Riot Games are going to let their top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> esports teams receive sponsorship from gambling companies, in a bid to snaffle up some of the billion dollar unofficial sports betting scene that surrounds both games.</p>
<p>The publishers promise that they'll put appropriate "guardrails" in place to ensure that streams of tournaments aren't suddenly overrun by shady gambling ads, and to protect players and viewers from the psychological impacts of gambling. They even think it'll be beneficial to the community, in supposedly giving Riot more control of the existing esports gambling business. But the overriding rationale here is very much 'this is a big dirty pie and we'd rather like a slice'. </p>
<p>The change in policy will only apply to tier 1 League of Legends and Valorant teams in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that," Riot's head of publishing and esports John Needham <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">explains in a blog post</a>. "However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not. </p>
<p>"Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies," he continues. "Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham supports this with a few figures taken from a <a href="https://sportradar.com/">Sportsradar</a> analysis. Apparently, "the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024". However, "70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed". Riot feels it's "better to engage in allowing betting sponsorships - thoughtfully, carefully, and with the right protections - than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked." In other words, Riot are of the opinion that the best way to protect people from the gambling companies is to team up with them.</p>
<p>As for the "guardrails" against predatory or anti-competitive behaviour on the part of either the bookies or their player partners: sports betting companies hoping to sign a deal with one of Riot's partner teams will need to be vetted by Riot. Those companies will also need to make use of GRID, a third-party esports data-gathering platform, who partnered with Riot in 2023. As Needham comments, "using clean, official data is critical to weakening black markets and stopping shady operators from taking advantage of fans and pros". The teams themselves will need to set up an "Internal Integrity Program", to ensure they don't do anything dodgy, though Needham doesn't specify what such a program might consist of.</p>
<p>While the sports betting sponsorship will only be available to Tier 1 League Of Legends or Valorant esports teams, "a portion of Riot's revenues earned from the sports betting program" will be spent on prize pools, new tournaments and training for the Tier 2 bracket.</p>
<p>The last reassurance in the blog post is aimed at viewers: Riot-owned broadcast and social channels will remain "betting-free, which means no ads, no sponsored segments from betting partners, and no betting partner logos on team jerseys", though this doesn't appear to apply to co-streams. Teams will get to decide how sports betting shows up on their own channels "within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS, and local regulations".</p>
<p>As Connor Makar unfolds over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant">Eurogamer</a>, the context for these announcements is that the esports industry is in need of a cash injection, post-Covid-lockdowns and following the demise of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> League in particular. Riot and parent company Tencent are in the mood to boost their numbers, going by the language around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">recent layoffs</a>. Still, none of this is really in the interest of everyday players and viewers, especially the many children who watch esports tournaments and follow the top teams. Gambling is a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling">public health problem</a>, and now, League Of Legends and Valorant are part of it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-will-let-gambling-companies-sponsor-league-of-legends-and-valorant-esports-teams]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For a little while now, a group of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders have been working on adding a custom adventure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> that'll see you travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations you'll remember from previous Baldur’s Gate games. It's called Path to Menzoberranzan, and its devs have now gotten thir first build working, with demo-related news seemingly just around the corner.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/baldurs-gate-3-path-to-menzobarranzan-custom-campaign-mod-interview">interviewed Lotrich and Tomobamba</a>, the mod's project lead and lead writer, about their creation earlier this year, around the time they'd set their sights on releasing a demo in mid 2025, with a full release to follow at some point down the line depending on how that went. Since then they've been hard at work building and fleshing out the likes of custom locations, bosses, and a whole cast of new companions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1387740347387482203">latest monthly progress update</a> on Path to Menzoberranzan's Discord server, Lotrich lead off by announcing that the team had gotten their "first working build" up and running. "We’ve made big strides on the starting location," he wrote, "The build includes combat, dialogues, companions, and a slice of the story to dive into. We're not sharing it to public access, yet, but it will provide a solid foundation for our first demo in the future."</p>
<p>With the FAQ of the server still citing a January post about that mid 2025 demo release goal, and the calendar having now shuffled around to June, I reached out to Lotrich to see if he had any updates to offer demo-wise. The modder was keen to keep his cards close to his chest, but did tease that the team's keeping some demo-related news "under wraps just a little longer".</p>

<p>Moving back to the updates the PTM crew did share, Lotrich noted that they're "deep into research on implementing custom music". They've also been working on both new armour and 3D models for the mod's companions, who'll be a fresh cast of fully voice-acted faces, rather than the existing gang of Astarion, Shart, and the rest.</p>
<p>The modder added that "reorganizing the teams to streamline our workflow and make collaboration smoother for everyone" has been a focus, while PTM's PR team have been prepping "new types of videos to better showcase our progress, visuals, and behind-the-scenes efforts".</p>
<p>Up to this point, the looks that we've gotten at Path to Menzobarranzan's progress have come through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1k3pspn/custom_campaign_path_to_menzoberranzan_city/">screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lotrichexe4860">YouTube videos</a> Lotrich has been sharing every so often. There've been some interesting snippets of characters wandering around Athkatla, with the modders having told me in that chat earlier this year that their aim with the demo would be to deliver an explorable Waukeen's Promenade and Irenicus' Dungeon.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what the mod looks like once a playable version's out. The base version of Baldur's Gate 3's an incredibly tough act to follow for anyone, but it's been cool to see these modders and others trying complex stuff with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-will-add-official-mod-tools-this-september-making-it-even-easier-to-play-dungeon-master">modding tools Larian released last year</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's here. No, not the end of the world as we know it, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Arrowhead had been teasing adding said cape, dubbed "Pillars of Freedom", to the game as an inside joke since that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">whole PSN controversy last year</a>, when HD2 got so many negative reviews from folks angry at account linking being made mandatory that its Steam graph's red lines were long enough inspire amateur fashion designers. The developers and Sony have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">restored access</a> to the game in a bunch of countries the PSN change rendered it unpurchasable in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes">paving the way</a> for this gear gag.</p>

<p>"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead tweeted upon deploying this back-covering cloth that resembles the Steam review graph at the time of the review bombing, "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armories as soon as the rollout is complete.</p>
<p>"This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED</p><p>In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape.

<p>Cue raucous celebrations in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1llsfy9/review_bomb_cape_is_here/">Redditosphere</a> and on Discord. "I can’t believe they actually did it," wrote one joyous player, "And good on them for waiting until Sony actually opened the game back up to all those countries, instead of last year when everyone was celebrating the half-victory."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another declared: "I'm not taking it off. I waited a long year for my country to be removed from [the] region block." Yep, this really has been a long time in the making.</p>
<p>Sony walked back their plans to make the account mandatory on May 6, 2024. It's now June 27, 2025. 13 months. 60 weeks. 417 days. Something in the region of 9,998 hours. Something in the region of 599,910 minutes. Something in the region of 35,994,615 seconds.</p>
<p>Babies have been born. People have died. Countless hells have been dived.</p>
<p>And now, cape.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape]]></content:encoded>
