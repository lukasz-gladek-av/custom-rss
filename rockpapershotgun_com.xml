            <p>Given how quickly older games can be delisted or end up near impossible to run properly without tinkering nowadays, efforts like GOG.com's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> are always nice to see. There's obviously a money-making motive behind it for the storefront, but keeping retro works in working order's a noble way to earn that cash. As it turns out, though, the folks behind the CD Projekt-owned site underestimated just how difficult an undertaking the program would be.</p>
<p>That's not to suggest they're giving up though, just that they've had to re-evaluate some of their ambitious early goals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"To be perfectly honest, it’s harder than we thought it would be," GOG senior business development manager Marcin Paczynski told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-we-launched-resident-evil-on">The Game Business</a>. "What we’ve found out is that the games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than what we thought. And we are not talking only about the game not launching. We are talking about more subtle things as well, like the game not supporting modern controllers, or the game not supporting ultra-widescreen or modern resolutions, or even a simple thing like being able to minimalize the game, which is an essential feature today. Modern gamers expect to be able to minimalize the game and then to bring it up without issues."</p>
<p>So, it's turned out that the sellers have had more work on their hands than they anticipated to bring older games up to "the standards that we defined". As you might expect, that's led to the revamped games pot not filling up at quite the rapid rate GOG predicted, with the preservation program now forecasted to end 2025 with somewhere between 300 and 350 titles, rather than the 500 originally set as a goal. As of writing, it's 232 games strong.</p><p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski also picked out the ancient DRM tech old games have often been saddled with as a headache when it comes to performing these updates, suggesting that companies should consider making the DRM easier to ditch once it's protected the game around launch. The other side of that coin, of course, is that companies will always want to cover their own backs - convincing them to compromise early on in the name of a future comeback project surely resembles a chat with a tie-wearing brick wall in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>Finally, Paczynski picked out a couple of cases which have seen getting the rights to preserve games present a different challenge than simply convincing a lawyer people still dig classic Resi. Amongst other things, GOG have hunted down ex-shooter devs turned Texan oil magnates, and hired a private investigator to track down one bloke living totally off-the-grid who'd inherited the rights to some games. </p>
<p>Imagine, you're living in a tent in the wilds of somewhere like the Scottish highlands. As you snooze, the zip gently winds down, startling you into fight or flight mode. It's Tom Selleck. 'Oi, people want to play Links: The Challenge of Golf without running into weird popping audio,' he declares. You reach into an old tin and hand him a bit of paper which reads 'Do what you want with it'. He leaves. You accidentally forget to check that none of the berries you've picked for breakfast are poisonous.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I can't remember much about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1942">Battlefield 1942</a>, two decades on, but I'm pretty sure I never thought "by golly, what if this + enormous sad stone monsters" while storming the beaches of Wake Island. It's one of many things that separate me from Fumito Ueda, director of melancholy PS2 titan-feller Shadow Of The Colossus, first released in 2005. In a new interview, he and other staff at Team Ico and Sony explore the game's development from start to finish, including some early dabblings with multiplayer.</p><!--more-->
<p>That SOTC - aka Nico, aka Ico 2 - was envisaged as a group hunting sim is reasonably well known, but this is the first I've heard that it took inspiration from DICE's khaki ballistics fest. Read all about it in <a href="https://www.designroom.site/shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history/">this oral history</a> published by Design Room, a longread mothership recently launched by former Polygon writers.</p>
<p>The piece begins with Ueda and other staff reflecting on the poor sales of Ico, their reputation-making Gormenghastian escort questathon. "In terms of inspiration, I wasn't playing many offline games back then," Ueda recalls. "But I was really hooked on Battlefield 1942, an FPS. I felt immense potential in the experience of that as a competitive game, where you'd shoot at or help out other players you didn't know. That desire to create a network game - meaning a game where you play together, battle, or cooperate with others online - led me to start with the idea of a game where you cooperate to defeat giant monsters."</p>
<p>Design Room include a cheeky offstage Jerry Springer-style reaction here from Johan Persson, the lead programmer responsible for Battlefield 1942's original concept. "You tend to just assume these ideas were the result of someone having a eureka moment, waking up one morning, without any context," he says.</p><p>You might think that Capcom's original Monster Hunter would be the major influence, but that only came out the year before SOTC, and it's hard to imagine the development timelines lining up. Still, the prototype outline given by then-Sony Computer Entertainment America producer Kyle Shubel certainly evokes the team tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and co. "I'm going to stun it. I'm gonna tie its leg while you mount on top of it. I'll go in front of it and blind it while he takes it out," Shubel expounds. "That concept, and then jumping back off onto your horses, and riding off in the sunset -- yeah, if we could have pulled that off, everyone would be talking about this game."</p>
<p>The multiplayer concept didn't come together for mostly humdrum reasons. Team Ico had little experience making multiplayer games, and PlayStation's online support was in its infancy at the time. The idea never progressed beyond some early prototypes. "We probably hadn't gotten as far as testing multiplayer, or maybe we just connected two controllers on a local network and were able to move characters around," Ueda says. "That was about the extent of it. We hadn't reached the point where you could play online. </p>
<p>"Personally, I thought we could attempt making a multiplayer game because we were developing within Sony's first-party studios," he goes on. "But looking at the production resources at the time, I decided that we couldn't realistically do it. To efficiently concentrate resources, we cut the multiplayer portion." Ueda adds that it was likely other parts of Sony's Japan Studio would have had to help out.</p>
<p>SOTC was a humongous undertaking even without the ability to gank the lonesome juggernauts. "Compared to Ico, this game had to have the following: an open-world setting with dynamic loading to express infinite space; "deforming collision" where you cling to giant structures; and a quadrupedal animal for the horse," Ueda details. "All of these features were already raising the bar significantly compared to Ico.</p><p>"We had nearly the same production team as Ico, and we knew network games were tough to make. Adding network support would also require the player to have more hardware to play, limiting those who could experience it. For these reasons, I decided to cut our losses early." It wasn't the only thing they ended up chopping - the game had 48 colossi at one point, not 16. You can read more in the full feature, with selections reserved for paying subscribers.</p>
<p>Given SOTC's story themes, introducing multiplayer may seem utterly ruinous. It's hard to imagine losing yourself in the mossy undulations of massive grieving metaphors when you have DorminNova69 spamming "revive me" in chat.</p>
<p>Still, grief is as much a collective ritual as a personal ordeal, and there is such a thing as "emotive multiplayer" - see the sherpas of Journey and the gloomier covenants of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Somebody should make a proper mod for it. Somebody should mod the colossi into Battlefield 1942 as well. I'm frankly appalled that there don't appear to be any such mods already - SOTC at least has the excuse of (somehow) not yet being officially available on PC.</p>
<p>As for what Ueda is up to these days: he and Team Ico are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-is-making-a-giant-robot-piloting-game">getting into the mech business</a>.</p>
