            <p>
How about a fresh look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-call-starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-a-sequel-the-original-still-has-years-of-updates-ahead">not-an-Astroneer-sequel</a> from System Era? The developer revealed an extended look at gameplay yesterday, detailing what it is you'll be doing exactly. As has already been established, it's an online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> game, one of those "friendslop" kind of games you'll see people be mean about on Ditter and TikTok comments. To be specific, you can play it solo, or with three of your friends, but there are elements that draw on other players (more on that in a bit).
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of These Kinds Of Games (we really should agree on a name for them at this point), to start off you'll have to prepare for the challenge ahead. You do this on the titular S.S. Starseeker, a big ole ship filled with a bunch of other cutely designed also titularly titled Astroneers. Here, you'll buy and craft different tools and items to bring with you, and decide what it is you want to take with you on expeditions. That might be something useful, or, if you're that kind of person who just likes to goof around while everyone else actually has fun playing the game, you could bring a beach ball instead.

<p>
Expeditions! Structurally these sound pretty par for the course. You land on a planet, you go do a mission or a task or somesuch, and you get back before your oxygen runs out. Along the way there might be alien creatures to do battle with, bits of loot to plunder, that sort of thing.
</p><p>
The Astroneery element of it all is that you have a terrain tool that you can modify in different ways. At its base you just remove terrain, but different nozzles can make it shoot out water, build up the land, launch aliens or yourself into the sky, etc.
</p>
<p>
There's no procedural generation to be found on the planets you visit either, the main one the game is launching with, Tefra, was made by hand, so you'll be able to revisit particular locations from expedition to expedition. As you progress, you'll also unlock more landing zones to other parts of the planet, which subsequently have tougher challenges to face.
</p>
<p>
These challenges might include something simple like repairing some equipment, or bringing up a receiver to a high point on the map. Some of them might even encourage you to work with other groups of players to complete them, a point I quite like - there's not enough online games about collaboration out there!
</p>
<p>
No exact release date just yet, but Starseeker: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/astroneer">Astroneer</a> Expeditions is due out some time in 2026.

            <p>It's pointless me trying to sum this game up before you've clapped the lips of your eyes around it and taken a long drag. There's a trailer below. Do it now. Nod if you've done so. Right, that was Soul Injector Commando, a video game about shooting some semblance of everyday humanity into the bodies of the billionaires who're behind all of the world's problems.</p>

<p>You are the Soul Injector Commando, brought back from the dead by god themselves and sent to a bunker. All of the rich bellends have been handily lured there by an audacious fake meteorite prank worthy of enshrinement atop the YouTube algorithm until the end of time. You romp through, soul injecting until you can soul inject no more.  </p>
<p>There a nine levels to get through, filled with these malcontents who'll "become normal humans, get normal jobs, and be happy" if you succeed. At your disposal are a number of different weapons and upgrades, fully voice acted dialogue I assume will help you tell them the error of their ways, and time trials to try if you get through a bout of soul injecting and decide you'd like to try that level again.</p><p>And, to be frank, why wouldn't you? I can't see the likes of being assembled by a dino head with six arms, blasting your way through a supermarket while coins flick around and a big bowl guy waves a gloved hand in joy/resignation, or driving a tiny SUV with wings getting old quickly. Ditto splattering execs as a sentient golf ball, encountering what looks like an intergalactic skeletal drummer, or fighting whatever the head thing that pops up around the minute mark is. I've not even mentioned the two-headed butterfly knight creature.</p>
<p>To bring us back down to Earth a bit, Soul Injector Commando's the latest work of developer and artist <a href="https://www.jeremycouillard.com/">Jeremy Couillard</a>, who's got a well-honed knack for the surreal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014570/AlienAfterlife/">AlienAfterlife</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188760/JEF/">JEF</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506080/Fuzz_Dungeon/">Fuzz Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164310/Escape_From_Lavender_Island/">Escape From Lavender Island</a>, and the snappily-named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789380/Sometimes_to_Deal_with_the_Difficulty_of_Being_Alive_I_Need_to_Believe_There_Is_a_Possibility_That_Life_Is_Not_Real/">Sometimes to Deal with the Difficulty of Being Alive, I Need to Believe There Is a Possibility That Life Is Not Real</a>. They're all now on my wishlist, and not solely because their art styles are 90% made up of things that my uncle's prog rock band would've given anything to put on their album covers.</p>
<p>Soul Injector Commando doesn't have a release date yet. It strikes me as the kind of game that'll just rock up instantly whenever the universe needs it to. Until then, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3220370/Soul_Injector_Commando/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developers Sandfall Interactive have wheeled out news that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'ll be getting a free update which'll include a new location for its party to explore, more boss battles, and some extra costumes. The studio are teasing that there'll be other stuff packed into this update, which they say is designed to act as a thank you to folks who've delved into the Belle Époque Frenchness.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche told our mates/mortal enemies over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Euro Truck Gamer 2</a>. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now." He added that this update is "not a super big DLC extension with hours of content", but will contain "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well", so set your expectations right in the middle.</p>
<p>The studio have <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive">confirmed some of the stuff that'll be in there</a>. "A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover," is the headliner, but some extra boss battles to challenge late game grinders are giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>The expeditioneers - no idea if they're ever called that in the game, but I'm rolling with it - will get some new clothes to rock. Text and interface localisation in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian is also incoming. Sandfall have teased that there'll be more things, but they're not revwheeling those things yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Nic had some words about Clair Obscur when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">reviewed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Very occasionally, I'll play an RPG that makes me feel ten again. Rebirth. Cris Tales. Revisiting Suikoden. Years come, the big number ticks down, and comfortable appreciation replaces the spellbound enchantment of being told a story, of being swept off to a new world. Of playing Final Fantasy 8 in that special edition shirt that Ben Starr likes to wear that I wish I'd kept because I bet it's worth a bloody fortune now. You wait for a game to bring you back there, mostly certain you've moved passed the capacity to feel that way because you now have the sort of adult concerns that cause you ask how much a shirt might be worth on Ebay. I can't say if Clair Obscur will work its magic on everyone the same way, but it certainly did for me. I'm still not ready to leave, honestly. What a special and rare thing this is: a story that feels like someone wanted to tell it so badly it hurt.</blockquote>
<p>Come on dude, stop sitting on the fence and give us some indication of how you feel.</p>
<p>This free Clair Obscur update's got no release date or estimate attached yet, so it'll definitely arrive after Nic achieves the power to reach through my screen, grab me by the collar, and tell me he thought the game was the term above good.</p>
