            <p>
The best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> games are often the ones where the thing you actually do is dead simple, with the challenge coming from an intricately woven path of twists and turns on doing said thing. Like, for example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba is You</a>. You (Baba) are a rabbity thing that pushes wordy blocks around, changing the very fabric of reality as you (Baba) do so. And here we are, with one last big update for the game.
</p>
<p>
Said update, as described in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/736260/view/500593045099514415?l=english">Steam post</a>, "most probably be the final large update for BIY." For the most part the post is just patch notes as to what the update contains, seemingly mostly focused on providing new ways for custom level makers to, well, make even more custom levels, alongside some other general fixes and mod support additions.
</p>
<p>
There's a small treasure trove of new objects you (not Baba) can be in place of Baba, like a hotdog, a brain, a cactus, a yes or a no, and most sweetly, a fox. You'll find a handful of new words like become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. What the last two states of emotions may do in the context of puzzles, I don't know, but I ask that you do not make Baba is Angry, because that would make me quite sad.
</p>
<p>
In terms of bug fixes and adjustments, while searching through custom levels you can skip five pages at a time, some ambient loops have been added into the music selection, typos and other miscellaneous mishaps were fixed. On the modding front, that's all a bit too technical for me, but if it's your kind of bag then it'll surely be helpful.
</p>
<p>
It's a touch sad to see this as the more-or-less end of Baba is You, but nothing can last forever! If you've never checked Baba is You out, it's available to pick up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">Steam</a> right this second.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> blocks up in early access this month, having swiftly gone from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">thing in need of ressurection</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">thing that's coming out</a>. As such, the team of devs led by original Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme are firmly in promo mode, with the world generation mechanics they've just posted a deep dive into clearly being an aspect of the game they think'll be key to its appeal.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"As I mentioned publicly a few days ago, this new approach to world generation will redefine the block-game genre," reads the first line of Collins-Laflamme's outro to this <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/the-future-of-world-generation">world gen explainer</a>, which is otherwise penned by an engineer and designer duo called Dan and Amber. That's pretty eye-catching verbiage from a lead who's otherwise generally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">keen to couch any hype-talk</a> in more realistic chat about the game currently having plenty of warts which'll need ironing out in the long run.</p>
<p>So, what makes Hytale's biome creation tech worth shouting about? "For the first time, artists and game designers can take full ownership of world generation, with complete control over the final result," Collins-Laflamme summarises. "This is a fundamental shift away from a world shaped almost solely by programmers."</p>
<p>The rest of the post delves a lot deeper into gritty details. The artist and designer-first focus is so important, so say Hytale's devs, because it'll allow the game to feel "curated and procedural". Basically, the aim's to have their cake and eat it, with the game boasting both the sort of expansiveness often only achievable without endless work by employing some procedural generation and the handcrafted feel that's long been the biggest strength of smaller environments totally pieced together by developers.</p><p>It's a very tough line to tread if you've got a foot in both camps - just ask Bethesda how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> went. What's clear is that creative offerings of the second of the two versions of Hytale world generator that the team are working with will be key to pulling this off. That newer version's viewed as the game's future and will be what it gradually shifts to over time, after initially  launching on the first iteration of the world generator. That older version, developed between 2016 to 2020, "already has many biomes and content ready to go".</p>
<p>The second version's still currently a work-in-progress, but is planned to take over down the line with the old one gradually being phased out - though worlds built with it will endure. During the transition between those two states, it sounds like you'll be able to peek through special "gateways" which allow you to try out bits being built in the second world generator. And breathe. That seems a lot of moving parts to me, but the devs certainly project being confident it's a landing they can stick.</p>
<p>In other fresh Hytale news, the Minecrafty sandbox's early access launch on January 13th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">will come with native Linux support</a>, but it isn't guarunteed to work seamlessly on the Steam Deck right out of the gate.</p>

            <p>
A nice, juicy nine-minute-long <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> gameplay trailer has been plucked from the tree of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games today. Juicy in the sense that nine minutes is plenty of time to help ascertain whether a game looks like it could be fun, yet if we're sticking with this metaphor this is one of those apples that's really good but has a nasty bruise on it you have to avoid.
</p>
<p>
First, the good part. This is a pretty neat looking stealth game! The trailer paints a much clearer picture of what you'll be getting up to, showing off a mission in which you broach a very tall fortress you need to make your way up to get some quartz, a valuable resource that also helps the titular goblin Styx pull off some of his magical tricks.

<p>
He can turn himself invisible, sneak under bits of flooring, poison a drinks pot to take down an enemy that's too big for him to outright kill, melting him afterwards to hide the evidence. Styx also has these sort of monkey-esque creatures that can kill enemies for or alongside him. Even stealth games can't escape being Breath of the Wildified, as the green goblin also has a paraglider at his disposal which he can use to glide about the place, alongside a grappling hook that lets him zip about.
</p><p>
According to a press release, Blades of Greed follows a metroidvania style structure, allowing you to explore new areas in places you've previously visited when you unlock more abilities. A fun approach for a stealth game that sounds like it could keep things fresh!
</p>
<p>
And here's where the bruise comes in. I get that Styx as a character is meant to have these zippy, quippy one liners, but yeesh are they laid on thick. Admittedly at points he's vocally reactive in a way that feels surprisingly quick, to the point I can't tell if it was added in the edit for the trailer. He also never shuts up, even outlining the different options you can take, so I do hope it is a trailer-only thing. I mean come on, he references Scarface at one point, who does that any more?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's not all that long until Styx: Blades of Greed launches, as it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-blades-of-greed-isnt-releasing-in-2025-after-all-but-thats-okay-because-its-got-a-firm-release-date-now">currently slated for release</a> next month on February 19th.

            <p>If you're a fan of both the colour grey being draped all over designs that could be accurately described as both angular and slabby, you're in luck. A third brutalist map jam has hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, with this one being less of a fan-made map pack and more of a huge overhaul mod - the concrete cavernousness of which dwarfs the original game.</p>

<p>Quake's first two brutalist map jams, which dropped in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-in-a-new-map-pack-thats-all-about-concrete">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">2023</a>, contained 35 and 30 maps respectively. This third one contains 77. Imagine the sheer weight and density of all of those floors and walls. The maps aren't all this "megalithic community project more than a year in the making" has to offer, either.</p>
<p>"The goal for QBJ3 was to make something uniquely ambitious for the community to build with us," reads the project's intro blurb. "Beginning production in the winter of 2024, the team slow-cooked a total conversion mod in (semi) secret. In October 2025 the work-in-progress mod was unleashed upon the community, who spent the next six weeks exploring its tools, testing its limits, and ultimately creating the worlds for the mod to take place in."</p><p>Among the stuff being tested were a bunch of new weapons, monsters, powerups, and "a complete visual overhaul of Quake's existing roster". The armaments, which you can see shown off in a suitably grey armoury in the video below, include a pipe wrench dubbed Skullcracker and dual-wielded automatic nail guns. Oh, and in case those aren't brutalistic enough for you, there's the Rebar Cannon. It's an "industrial crossbow" which fires rusty metal bolts with a satisfying churm-kachunk sound effect that belongs woven into the percussive mix of some 90s German heavy metal.</p>

<p>To get your hands on the Rebar Cannon you'll need to pick one of the two options by which this third brutalist jam can be grabbed via <a href="https://qbj3.slipseer.com/">Slipseer</a>. The recommended version works like a regular mod, bolting to your copy of Quake and a source port of your choosing (the modders suggest <a href="https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail">Ironwail</a>). Then, there's a version which works like a standalone game that you can extract and run right away, since it comes already set up with Ironwail and open source Quake remake project LibreQuake.</p>
<p>As with Alice O's writeup of the first Quake Brutalism Jam, I'll end this newsing by disclosing that this third jam also includes a map by <a href="https://x.com/radiatoryang/status/2007635685113770212">Robert Yang</a>, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/robert-yang">written for RPS</a> about Quake and level design.</p>
