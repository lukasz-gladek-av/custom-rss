            <p>The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> game in development at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> Games is in difficulties, according to sources of the multiple and anonymous persuasion. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-bioshock-announced">Announced in 2019</a>, the game has reportedly failed a recent internal progress review, with its narrative found to be in particular need of revamping. </p>
<p>Publishers 2K Games aren't talking about any of this, naturally, but they <em>have</em> confirmed that they've treated Cloud Chamber to a not-at-all punitive studio reshuffle, with Kelley Gilmore losing her position as studio head, while former creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been reassigned to a publishing role.</p>
<p>The report comes care of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), who cite "people familiar with the situation". Gilmore and de la Plante's reassignments may not be the worst of the fallout. According to Bloomberg, staff were told at a recent all-hands meeting that they had to become "more agile and efficient" - a phrase equivalent in balefulness to "would you kindly", and a possible indication that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>2K Games ain't talking about that either. Here's what they've said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">IGN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about the new Bioshock, which may not be titled Bioshock 4 inasmuch as reverting to numbered sequels feels a bit ridiculous after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>. I used to win a lot of playground arguments by dint of the formula "timesed by infinity... <em>plus one</em>", but I can't see a major games publisher adopting that particular rhetorical gambit as a naming strategy. Ehhh, maybe Square Enix.</p>
<p>The little we know about the new Bioshock includes the fact that original series figurehead and videogame thespian Ken Levine isn't working on it. He's off making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> at Ghost Story Games. Beyond that, we can only speculate based on previous instalments. There will, presumably, be a man, a city and a lighthouse. It'll be an FPS with a sprinkling of imsim and some arch literary ambitions, and there will be a false utopia of some kind. You will be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand">shoot animals out of your hands</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report also alleges that 2K Games cancelled a Bioshock 1 remake earlier this year. I think I can probably do without a Bioshock remake, but I'm sorry for any developers potentially affected. Best of luck to all at Cloud Chamber bringing Nushock home.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Techno-loving hollowtooth Blade has joined the playable cast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, but he's not what I find most interesting about the free-to-play shooter's latest update. Developers NetEase Games have introduced a new system of penalties for ragequitters, keyboard-away-frommers, and other craven scumbags who abandon a competitive mode match early on because the dishwasher's overflowing, or similar.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I find all this interesting simply because it's trying to automate Justice and determine a disconnecting player's good or bad faith, based on a bunch of dumb numbers. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541112753868243356?l=english">read about the update in full on Steam</a>, but here's a quick overview with fewer number tables and fewer intervening remarks about *squints* "Panther &amp; Wolverine's Sneaky Sounds".
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects during match loading, the ban/pick phase, hero selection, or within the first 70 seconds of the match, the whole match will be deemed invalid, and the disconnecting player will receive a points penalty that scales with repeat offences.
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects after 70 seconds, and doesn't reconnect before the match ends, they'll be Naughty Stepped as follows: 1) If the match ends within 90 seconds of their disconnection, there's no points penalty 2) If their team loses 90-150 seconds after they disconnect, they get a points penalty and competitive matchmaking ban, which both scale with repeat offences, while other players on the losing team get ranked point compensation. 3) If the match ends over 150 seconds after they quit, they'll get a larger point penalty and comp matchmaking ban. 
</p>
<p>
If the player who quit does reconnect before the match ends, and their team wins, they won't be penalised. But if they reconnect and the team loses, they'll get a points penalty... but no competitive matchmaking ban. Fickle and winding are the conduits of karma.
</p>
<p>
Similar rules apply for players who are detected as being AFK in the first 70 seconds of a match. Softer wrist-slaps are being doled out to those who pull the plug early during quickmatch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The most severe punishments are reserved for those who both go AFK and disconnect early during competitive. Damned souls indeed. But what if, what if that player was only AFK because they had to go administer the kiss of life to a postman, after the latter keeled over while delivering a crateload of community service awards, and what if that player then quit the game because they had to google appropriate post-resuscitation care? How are you going to distinguish a virtuous soul like that from somebody who came back from the kitchen with a plate of pickles and decided they'd rather watch Grand Designs anyway?
</p>
<p>
I'd love to know what kind of audience or playtesting informs the time windows, here. Why is 70 seconds the cut-off point for distinguishing between a player who noped out because their house has caught fire, and a player who has yanked out the router in fury because they got sneakishly dog-piled by Wolverine and Panther?</p>
<p>I imagine one consideration is how long it takes players to reach certain objectives or chokepoints on average. Another consideration is possibly how long it takes them to charge their Ultimate abilities - heroes passively gain 12 points of Ultimate energy a second, with different Ultimates requiring different amounts of energy. Fiddly stuff. Anyway, you are welcome to disagree with me that all of this is more interesting than Blade.
