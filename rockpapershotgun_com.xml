I find city builders to be quite a stressful genre, mostly because I get freaked out as soon as my virtual bank account starts dipping into the red. Every now and then, though, one comes along that looks like it might actually be a calming time, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/synergy">Synergy</a> looks like it could fill that gap. It's been out in early access for almost a year now, but developer Leikir Studio announced today that Synergy will be leaving early access and entering 1.0 in just two weeks time on April 16th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The announcement came with a new trailer that keeps things brief but hands over the important thing (the aforementioned release date), as well as an overall look at what the game will offer. Over on Steam, though, a few more details about what the 1.0 update will bring. First up is that there'll be a new campaign with three new scenarios to explore, though what those are, you'll have to wait and find out.
</p>

<p>
There's also new plants and buildings to work with, as well as some new challenges linked to dry seasons, alongside an exploration rework. Outside of saying "and more", the Steam post just makes note that there'll be "huge [Quality of Life] improvements you've been waiting for", but again, not specifics, so you'll probably have to check out the 1.0 patch notes whenever they drop.
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with Synergy, you can probably guess just from looking at its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moebius">Moebius</a>-inspired stylings that it's a lot more plant and nature focused as opposed to the concrete jungles or historical encampments you might usually find in the genre. You can explore different regions, build up community, learn about its alien world. Nothing too stressful to be found here, just the way I like my sim games. You can check it out on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989070/Synergy/">here</a>.

For the most part, anything to do with the Nintendo Switch 2 won't have much to do with anyone in this neck of the woods, but its inaugural Direct did have some goodies for us PC players too. Like, for example, the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> Chapters 3 and 4 now have a release date, June 5th (which also happens to be when the Switch 2 comes out but that's neither here nor there). Mind, this is almost a good seven years after the first chapter dropped, and almost four since Chapter 2 was released, so it's been a long time coming.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That release date reveal came with a little teaser trailer that kicked things off with a person in a not at all annoying dog costume (that honestly looks pretty damn comfortable) before showing off a few, brief clips from the third and fourth chapters. It looks like everyone's favourite font-themed Skeleton will be back once again, alongside some new mechanics during battle, one of which appears to be manoeuvring your analogue sticks to protect yourself from… squiggles?

There's a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a>-esque bit too, and a couple of teases of scenes explicitly from Chapters 3 and 4 (there's tiny bits of the first two in the trailer) that seem a bit mysterious as well. Not much to go off of all in, but when has Toby Fox and co ever given away the goose that easily?
</p>
<p>
I can't offer you any more details than that, because there aren't any, though there is apparently a <a href="https://deltarune.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a> coming with some details sometime today that might be worth keeping an eye on.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Chapters 3 and 4 will be paid unlike the first two, and they won't be the end of Deltarune either. There's plans for a total of seven, so we'll have to wait and see about those last three.
