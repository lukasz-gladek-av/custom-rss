            <p>
Video game updates are an incredibly funny thing, mostly because I come from a time where they weren't a thing at all, apart from the odd second printing that patched some things here and there. Which is why my humerus has been particularly tickled by the news that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has arrived today that, amongst a couple of other things, add in the ability to simply let you jump.
</p>
<p>
Yes, that's right, you can finally make like the red (or green) plumber and leap into the air with the press of a button. It's actually an option that you'll need to turn on manually in the gameplay section of the options menu, under the advanced parkour option. As silly as an addition as this genuinely does sound, I can imagine it being a minute more freeing in turns of doing sick flips, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a parkour challenge thingy you can do now too if that takes your fancy! It does not take mine, because I don't own this game, but you can get a fancy signed vinyl, a statue, and some other bits if you win.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, those other two small update bits! You can now check a detailed stat page for your loadout to get into those microdetails regarding mostly pointless decimal point percentages. The other small change with this update is that the visual feedback for critical hits has been improved, though the only change I can personally notice is that the enemy's health bar flashes red to suggest you've done one. Perhaps I should go for an eyetest soon if I'm missing something.
</p><p>
It's also probably worth reminding you all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">1200 person strike</a> that took place last week over Ubisoft's recent cutbacks, i.e. those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">big proposed job cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">recently cancelled games</a>, which includes the remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last June, Jagex - the developers of medieval MMO Runescape - found themselves at odds with players after deciding not to create any new content for Pride Month. Disputed internally at the studio before the discussion then leaked online, the decision appeared to be a retreat in the face of a world turning on minority groups.</p>
<p>Following up in September, Games Industry asked Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy if he stood by the call to simply re-run existing Pride-themed quests and events. "Ultimately, my job is governance and protection as much as anything else, and so sometimes those kinds of harsh decisions have to be made to protect the imminent future of the game," he told them. "If there are tough decisions to be made next year, we'll make them. If the world has changed a bit and the environment is different, we will react accordingly."</p>
<p>Five months on and with this year's Pride Month on the horizon, we've asked if the environment is different.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I must admit there's another reason why I'm asking these questions of Jagex now. When I visited the developer's Cambridge studio last month to hear about their plans for Runescape, its Old School release, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>-like spinoff, Runescape: Dragonwilds, I didn't ask about Pride or last year's controversy, focusing instead on its 25th anniversary.</p><p>When I published my article on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-fight-for-runescapes-sharksuit-but-jagex-were-having-none-of-it-its-for-the-greater-good">changes Jagex are making to Runescape</a>, I was asked in the comments why there was no reference to the studio's decisions last June. In light of that oversight, I've gone back to ask Jagex's plans for Pride this year and if their decision was influenced by plans to hold in-person events in the US.</p>
<p>You can find the questions I asked and Jagex's answers below. But if you're not familiar with the context, let me give you a rundown of what happened.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/06/10/runescape-pride-2025/">PinkNews</a> reported that Jagex's then new CEO, Jon Bellamy, told staff in April they would not be running any Pride Month content in Runescape or Old School Runescape in June, instead focusing more on "what players wanted". The report quotes one staffer saying the decision showed the company was "catering to American conservatism", connecting the announcement to the fact Jagex's new owners, CVC Capital Partners, have a portfolio with many US investments.</p><p>Following Bellamy's initial message and pushback internally, the CEO held a Q&amp;A with the team.“I understand that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>… is precious because it is a safe space, it is an escape from reality, and the reality that we find ourselves in is changing," Bellamy is quoted as saying. "It is getting stranger, more troubling, less moral, I would argue. Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect."</p>
<p>In response to an open letter from staff, Jagex said they would run pre-programmed Pride content. That June, Jagex reactivated the <a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Tales_of_Pride">Tales of Pride event</a> in Runescape. First added in 2022 and re-run every Pride Month since, this is a questline that sends players to different people within the world to hear stories about asexual, bisexual, gay, and trans characters who have played a part in Gielinor's world. Completing the quest earns you a set of cosmetics, such as a banner, a shift, and a flower crown.</p>
<p>Separately, the community organised the Community Pride Event within Runescape, something they have been doing since 2020. As in previous years, this began as an in-game parade and ended in an after party. A similar parade was held in Old School Runescape.</p>
<p>In previous years, Jagex have run Pride-themed quests in Old School Runescape. In 2017, there was <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gilbert%27s_Colours">the Gilbert's Colours event</a>. Then new quests in <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2022_Pride_event">2022</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2023_Pride_event">2023</a>, and <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2024_Pride_event">2024</a>. Unlike Tales of Pride, each quest was unique and provided players newly-created cosmetic items. There wasn't a new quest added in 2025, nor was an old quest reactivated.</p><p>When our colleagues over at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-why-jagexs-new-ceo-is-happy-for-it-to-be-the-runescape-company">Games Industry</a> spoke to Bellamy in September, he told them, "I totally sympathise with what's being said. At the top of my totem pole will always be the continuity and operation of our games as apolitically as possible, because ultimately our games offer escapism to many hundreds of thousands of players every day. If that escapism opportunity is compromised, there's a very real risk to the business."</p>
<p>That brings us up to date. And so this is what I asked after posting my article last month.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Last year Jagex paused development of its Pride month content. Pink News reported that Jon Bellamy said Jagex would stop supporting the event to avoid a "backlash" and that "Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect.” He also is reported as saying that “The content.. is now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously, risk that I’m personally responsible to protect against.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that an accurate account of what he told staff? </strong></p>
<p>This was part of a broader discussion about a rapidly changing global environment and Jagex’s responsibility to protect the long-term health of the game and safeguarding the studio and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be supporting Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be developing any new content for Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>What pressure was Jagex feeling that it needed to stop supporting Pride? Or, if it wasn't feeling pressure, why did it volunteer to stop supporting an event that celebrates a minority group?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>What message does it send that Jagex wasn't willing to withstand the fear of a backlash for supporting a Pride event in-game? </strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>In my discussion with Ryan Philpott, he said "Some of the changes we're going to make might make some of our current players less than happy, but it's for the greater good of the game long term." Is cutting Pride an example of this?</strong></p>
<p>No – given nothing has been “cut” from the game in terms of inclusive representation or existing Pride-related content.</p>
<p><strong>Jagex is running an event in the US this year. Would Jagex be able to run Pride events in RuneScape and host an in-person event in the US, or does one preclude the other?</strong></p>
<p>The two are unrelated. In-person events are about celebrating our community and engagement; in-game content decisions are about what fits the world and how we develop it.</p>
<p><strong>In his opening speech at the event, Jon highlighted the success and growth RuneScape is enjoying. Would that growth and success not have been possible if the developer supported Pride?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As in 2025, then, Jagex will be running the Tales of Pride event in Runescape. They will also support community run events in Runescape and Old School Runescape. However, and I've been back to confirm this, they will not be creating any additional quest content for Pride Month in 2026.</p>

            <p>I wake up at 3AM. Do 50 pull-ups on a halberd wedged in the door frame. Do 50 push-ups on the cold stone floor. A servant hands me my protein mead and a wine frappamachiato. I violently double fist the two beverages. I don't eat breakfast, because food that isn't flavourless cup gruel is the enemy of productivity. Then, I'm dressed in my robes for the commute to the throne room. The magic starts. It's 5AM in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and I'm on my medieval monarch grindset.</p>
<p>I pull out Paradox's <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-192-spring-cleaning.1902372/">latest dev diary</a>. Oh, look at that, they're working with a mystery modder on bringing exactly the sort of big number tables to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> that I need to tell at a glance whether I'm out-grinding my inbred wealth-creating cousins who rule other nations across the world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These big number tables are dubbed The Ledger, and once added to CK3 as part of the game's next major update, they'll give you a big spreadsheet to delve into if you're keen to look up certain aspects of your kingverse. For example, you can quickly check which ruler across the world has the most gold without having to click on them all, or see which of the current crop of wars has been running the longest.</p>
<p>Handy, and according to Paradox design manager Riad Deneche it's the product of some direct collaboration between the studio and a mystery modder whose identity will be revealed in a future dev blog. "Much of their work had already inspired us internally and influenced changes we’d made to the game," the developer wrote. "When I reached out, instead of assigning a predefined task, I asked a simple question: what would you like to work on? They came back with a list so large it genuinely shocked the team. Some of it overlapped with things already in our pipeline, but a lot of it made us collectively ask, 'How did we not think of this?'"</p><p>The Ledger was one of those ideas, and the initial version of it's set to include tabs covering characters, artifacts, ongoing Wars, and houses. All things you might want to sort through, compare or just check up on if you're loading up a save you've put a lot of hours into for the first time in a while. I can't say I've been playing CK3 long enough to have any properly ancient games to return to, but even a couple of weeks gap between checking on my weird Scottish co-monarchy can leave me struggling to remember off the top of my head what's going on.</p>
<p>The likes of counties, titles, holdings, faiths and cultures are also being considered for tabs of their own, and Deneche points out that modders will likely come up with ones the developers don't think to add. Quite frankly, I'll be happy if I can sort monarchs by their percentage of inbredness or courtiers by how much they hate me.</p>
<p>The update that'll bring the ledger and a number of other quality-of-life additions/fixes is currently slated to arrive at the start of Q2, which if my understanding of corporatese is right will put it around the beginning of April.</p>
