            <p>The Completely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/normal-fishing">Normal Fishing</a> subgenre continues to flourish with the announcement of Dreadmoor, a jolly little tugboat enterprise set in a world of island-sized ribcages and heightened background radiation. My goodness, so normal! Normality readings off the scale. I am confident that nothing foetid and otherworldly waits in the darkness, far below your rudder. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The obvious parallel here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, the top-down cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trawling sim from Black Salt Games. Our previous captain Katharine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dredge-review">was a big fan</a>. At the risk of yet again sounding like Dr Contrarian S. Hype-Puncturer, I thought it was a bit mid. I loved the concept of reeling tetromino-shaped Cthulhaddock from the abyss while reckoning with a day-night cycle, but in practice, it just felt like a load of fetchquests revolving around a not especially gratifying mystery. </p>
<p>Dreadmoor resembles Dredge so closely in places that I'm tempted to refer to it as Dredgemore. It, too, obliges you to cram asymmetrical bottom-feeders into a grid-based inventory, rotating them to make optimal use of space. It, too, asks you to be careful after sundown. It, too, favours warm, flat colours and cartoon contours, to the point that the giant angler fish that emerge to swallow your boat seem almost pettable. It, too, follows a loop of selling bizarre ocean fauna to swivel-eyed weirdos, then using the proceeds to upgrade your ship and craft new gear.</p>
<p>But Dreadmoor cribs just as much from Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, with the ability to roam inside your boat, cast lines and even venture ashore in first-person view. The boat can be steered in third-person, the better to avoid any tentacles grasping at your timbers. I imagine all that's very attractive to people who are hankering for a Dredge 2.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm most enticed by the idea of crafting my own fishing lures, which puts me nicely in mind of China Mieville's The Scar. Remember the hook they used to reel in the Avanc? I'm not sure Dreadmoor's doughty steamship has the buoyancy or ballast for that kind of prey, but I live in hope/terror. There are apparently about 100 species of aquatic organism to yank rudely from the depths. You probably won't want to keep the stranger breeds aboard your vessel for long.</p>
<p>Dreadmoor has no release date as yet - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3629430/DREADMOOR/">read more on Steam</a>.

It turns out you won't actually be spicing up your life next month, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a delay. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> MMO was originally supposed to be launching this coming May 20th, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421">Steam post</a> was shared today sharing that its release date has been pushed to June 10th. Those that have the deluxe or ultimate edition on order will still be able to play it a few days earlier, now June 5th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Funcom explained that they came to this decision through feedback they've received from beta testers. On the flipside of things, there is some good news: a "large-scale weekend" is now planned for next month where "even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback." Though, hopefully this round of feedback won't delay the game further - can only imagine how much the devs will have to crunch with only three extra weeks! There's no further details about this beta just yet, but apparently they'll be coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening had originally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-burst-out-of-the-early-access-sands-in-early-2025">scheduled for sometime in "early 2025"</a>, but as with many games these days, plans change. I'm not sure if June counts as early any more, at least it's still technically in the first half of the year.
</p>
<p>
Right around this piece is likely to have gone live Funcom are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0KqiqdiBZ0&amp;ab_channel=Funcom">holding a livestream</a> showing off the game's combat, which seems like a good way to get a better feel for the game ahead of its new June release date.

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees.1164804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Welp, it's finally happened. After many months of mainly murder related updates, Larian's stonker of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has at last received its final major content update. Patch 8 - which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538849539213231622">read in full here</a> - brings Photo Mode, full cross play, and 12 new subclasses to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. That's one for each playable class, and likely at least six more than I'll ever reasonably experience. Still, a swarmkeeper ranger sounds very tempting. Yes the bees, is what I always say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The full set of subclasses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path of the Giant Barbarian</li>
<li>College of Glamour Bard</li>
<li>Death Domain Cleric</li>
<li>Circle of Stars Druid</li>
<li>Arcane Archer Fighter</li>
<li>Way of the Drunken Master Monk</li>
<li>Oath of the Crown Paladin</li>
<li>Swarmkeeper Ranger</li>
<li>Swashbuckler Rogue</li>
<li>Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li>
<li>Hexblade Warlock</li>
<li>Bladesinging Wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a sucker for a good drunken master, too. According <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Way_of_the_Drunken_Master">to the Wiki</a>, this'll grant your Monk immunity to negative booze effects, Ki regain once a day on drinking, a strike with a chance to make whatever you're punching drunk themselves, and another strike that sobers them up, causing psychic damage.</p>
<p>Oh, this sounds exciting too! There's now "partial level editing" available in the modding toolkit. "Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain," say Larian. "You can, however, create your own interactive objects". Sounds like you'll be able to add NPCs too, although mute ones, presumably.</p>
<p>The update also brings the usual round of fixes, although I haven't played in so long I couldn't tell you which of these were pressing issues. I've been waiting till this patch was out!</p>
<p>As for what's next for Larian, they've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games in the works currently</a>, although are yet to share any details. Wizards Of The Coast, meanwhile, seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3">throw money around for several more Baldur's Gates</a> to fall into their laps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
