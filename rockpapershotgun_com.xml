<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games have confirmed, and look, here’s a trailer featuring much headlong bloodshed in the villas, citrus groves and *squints* mysterious firelit dungeons of early 20th century Sicily.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> now releasing in 2026, the new Mafia is the criminal enterprise to beat this year. Rather than trying to fill the hole left by the Rockstar colossus, it’s playing things small with “a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay,” according to Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes.

<p>
As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Eurogamer</a>, 2K Games and parent company Take Two Interactive are positioning the new Mafia as a side dish for the enormous live service productions that have become triple-A publishing's stock in trade.
</p>
<p>
“We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments,” said 2K president David Ismailer in a release. “We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p>
<p>Good lord, I remember when accidentally uttering the word “linear” in a press release or interview for a big-budget action game was the kiss of death. You’d find torch-waving gamer mobs at your gates the next day. That era has passed below the horizon: we are older now, and full of woe. We crave the sweet succinctness of a mildly interactive corridor.
</p>
<p>
It’s definitely a tapdance, openly selling your game as a “complement” for other games - possibly the devs at Hangar 13 find the language here a bit condescending. My somewhat more depressing analysis is that The Old Country is effectively being offered as a holiday from those games. You've done your time at the seasonal content coalface, so off you go to Sicily for some highly scripted R&amp;R.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m less bothered by questions of length than by the fact that The Old Country seems quite formulaic and lumbering. Guy shoots guy. Guy shoots guy while hunkered down behind table. Guy drives car very fast. Guy stabs guy. I do like the environments, though – hopefully, Hangar 13 have baked in plenty of opportunity to just wander through the groves looking at trees and whatnot.

            <p>Paradox have announced grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a>, following some teasers last week. It's the next big entry in the series of complex globe-spanning historical simulations, and having played a little as the hapless ruler of Korea in the 14th century, I can confirm that it is so far as chunky, complicated, and deep as usual. The changes in this sequel won't look wild or revolutionary to a dabbler, but seasoned tyrants might find a lot to pique their interest. Come see a trailer below.</p>

<p>The developers announced the game in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">a recorded broadcast</a> and you can see it now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/">on Steam</a>. If you're already sold on the idea of carving up England into easily digestible chunks, and simply want to read about every little detail, then just go straight to my other article that describes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">everything we know about Europa Universalis 5</a>. It's big, but it's the most comprehensive summary of the game you'll find anywhere, or your florins back.</p>
<p>For everyone else, here's the skinny version. Europa Univarsalis 5 has been in development for the past few years at Paradox Tinto, a studio based in Spain. It's been called "Project Caesar" until now in an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/">ongoing development diary</a>, but it was clearly a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> game to anyone who looked at the screenshots included in those dev posts. Over the past year, the developers have shared a lot of info on the historical map 'em up's new features.</p>
<p>In its broadest strokes, this is still a game of painting in the map your favourite colour and marching armies across land that's not yours to the chagrin of your neighbours. The twist this time is that you'll have to keep four competing interest groups happy throughout your rulership: the commoners, the clergy, the nobility, and the burghers. </p>
<p>These "estates" are roughly based on the political idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm">the estates of the realm</a>. Annoy the peasants too much and they'll start to get rebellious. Irritate the nobility and you'll have trouble leveraging them for their military power. That sort of thing. If you've played swipey kingdom management game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, you'll get the idea. Except, of course, this will be much more finicky. As the crown, it's your job to placate peasant, prince and priest. The satisfaction levels of the estates will always be visible at the top of the screen.</p>

</figure>
<p>One other big change is that the game will feature "pops", like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> - the little units of people who work, migrate, and die in your armies. And they'll have needs that must be met, usually in the form of certain trade goods as common as wheat or as precious as gems. Other than that, there are "Ages" that you pass through in certain eras (the Renaissance or the "Age of Absolutism", for example) and named characters like kings, artists, and ministers are a little more prominent than before. </p>
<p>I've been playing an early build of the game and it is quite the monster. Granted, I'm much more of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> guy, but I can appreciate the vast and intricate machinery of a Europa Universalis. It is overwhelming in places so far (they haven't implemented a tutorial yet) and quite demanding of my PC given all the calculations happening. But this is sometimes the case with Paradox grand strategy, and I have spent a few afternoons as the frowning ruler of Korea struggling under the whip of imperial China but building a beautiful road network in the process. Pity about all the smallpox.  </p>
<p>There's no release date yet. But I'll share more impressions over the coming days, but for now, grab a very large cup of tea and make your way through my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">exhaustive guide post</a>. </p>
<p>The previous game, Europa Universalis 4, has been out for over a decade now, spawning dozens of DLC packs and getting countless updates. It's one of our readers' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">best strategy games of all time</a> and the only game I have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kings-of-the-castle-europa-universalis-part-1">seen played in an actual castle</a>. "EU IV is a fascinating simulation, an alternate history generator, a narrative tool and an entirely successful redesign of a strong formula," wrote Adam (RPS in peace) in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-europa-universalis-iv">olde reviewe</a>, written in approximately 1342. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-platformer-paperklay-is-a-little-bit-banjo-a-little-bit-littlebigplanet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> Paperklay has perhaps the least appealing protagonists I've seen in a game recently. I hate avian buddy duo "Chick &amp; Nugget" and all their works, beginning with the ghastly 3am pun that appears to have spawned them.</p>
<p>Look at that ampersand, dangling in the middle like a chunk of gristle. What an absolute crime against typography. And chickens. And platform game levels made of paper and card - you'd never put an <em>actual</em> chicken nugget on dioramas like these, the grease would ruin it. I also mistrust Chick's beady black eyes, and I can't abide the fact that Nugget is wearing a fragment of eggshell for pants. That's like a human child using a placenta as a necktie! Argh!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Anyway, none of that matters, because Paperklay looks to be an absorbing arts-and-crafty experience with large, transforming environments. It's got music from Banjo-Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee composer Grant Kirkhope and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> composer Steven Melin. Banjo is definitely the right parallel here. Trailer, away!</p>

<p>The game launches on 27th May, and still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350720/PaperKlay/">has a demo on Steam</a>. You can expect a familiar buffet of platforming moves - double-jumping, dashing, gliding and sprinting - plus platform puzzles that involve folding, unfolding and variously messing with the layout. There are solutions that, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, rotate the entire landmass you're traversing, exposing new routes. Developer Kevin Andersson has been working on the thing for a tidy three years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhyKev">documenting the development on his Youtube channel</a>. The latest press release estimates that the full game will last five to six hours.</p>
<p>Aside from upsetting me with its puns, Paperklay also reminds me that a lot of games now trade on fancy, tactile recreations of physical materials. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumino-city">Lumino City</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hirogami">Hirogami</a>, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from just this morning.</p>
<p>All these gameworlds are exquisitely made - every object creased and cut and stamped and embroidered to perfection by the unseen hands of godly artisans. I think there's an opportunity here for an arts-and-crafts experience in which the world has been sellotaped and glued together by people with no artistic talent whatsoever. At school, I once tried to make a papier-mache sculpture of a majestic valley. When I came back the next morning, it had shucked off its wire support and curled in on itself like a dead cockroach. Give me a platform level set inside that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
