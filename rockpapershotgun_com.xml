            <p>There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY-UoqYPbPk">Clive Barker's Jericho</a>, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-time-surrenders">As Time Surrenders</a> is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid V</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A man journeys through a desolate landscape, carrying a mysterious canister," says the game's website. "He is driven by a purpose only he understands. Crawl, crouch, sneak and shoot your way through the end of the world in this stealth-action game."</p>
<p>What that translates to is something that looks a lot like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes">MGSV: Ground Zeroes</a>. You'll be able to crouch-dive into the mud in a moment of panic, and tag enemies with thermal goggles. It's still early days, judging by the developer's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/merlinogames.bsky.social/post/3lh2jajlsws2l">various social media posts</a>. But there is some footage that puts together the prototypical movement and scouting you'll be doing. </p>

<p>As for all that brown, you can see some of the inspiration for the colour palette in <a href="https://x.com/merlino_games/status/1846926799269200252">a selection of retro games</a> posted by developer Merlino Games (aka Antonio Freyre) including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne">Max Payne 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire">Star Wars: Shadows Of The Empire</a>.</p><p>Freyre has made a handful of other games, mostly cheap and cheerful "minimalist stealth games" including the retro ragdoll punchin' of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493970/The_Chameleon/">The Chameleon</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202470/No_Sun_To_Worship/?curator_clanid=41492342">No Sun To Worship</a>, another moody stealtho that looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> but is really, we're told, all "about the importance of art". It's certainly got some very crunchy pixel textures. Mmmmm.</p>
<p>No clue when this latest sneaky endeavour is due to be released. As Time Surrenders doesn't even have its own Steam page yet - it's that early in development. For stealth fans, it will probably be beaten to the punch by Konami remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, but hey, it's not a race. It's a procure-on-site infiltration mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
