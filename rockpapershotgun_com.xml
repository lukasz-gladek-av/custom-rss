            <p>
It's been a little under a year since the vehicular combat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a> launched into early access, and yesterday developer Caged Element Inc. announced that it'll be receiving its 1.0 launch next week, May 22nd. There are a couple notable changes that come with this launch though. For starters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/wired-productions">Wired Productions</a> are taking over from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/plaion">Plaion</a> on publishing duties. As the devs explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2078450/view/541105873081074235?l=english">Steam post</a>, the reason this matters to you is the second change, which is that you'll have to pay for it when it arrives next week. Some of you, anyway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyone that played the early access version of the game will be getting the full release completely for free. That's great for that subset of people, though perhaps a small bummer for anyone that was interested but prefers to avoid early access games. Ah well, it won't be very expensive, as it'll only launching with a discounted price of $16 (the full price hasn't been shared just yet, though I doubt it'll be much more than that).
</p>
<p>
A press release also says that microtransactions are also being removed from the game with this change. Anyone that earned or bought in-game currency, called Teef, will still be able to spend it for the next 12 months. Anyone that is new to the game with the 1.0 launch won't be able to the in-game store where you can spend Teef. There'll also be some DLC packs coming at launch, which I'm assuming will be the same bits you'll be able to pick up with Teef, though this wasn't clarified in the press release.
</p>
<p>
Caged Element explained that moving away from free-to-play does have its benefits. For one, player-hosted matches with custom settings will be possible, alongside hosting private games. There will also be a new free-roam mode to "explore any map and create custom races."
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that the game won't be playable from this coming Tuesday, May 20th to the 22nd, launch day, so don't panic if you can't get your freek on.

These days, when there's so many games coming out that I feel like an overwhelmed dog with free reign in a butcher's, there's no sweeter sentence to me than "this game will take you no longer than two hours." I know for some people length is everything (don't), but personally I love a short, good time (seriously, leave it out). So the second I saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/formless-star">Formless Star</a>, an eclectic little creature cataloguing game, and read that it was one to two hours long, I was immediately in.
</p>

Here's the low down: you are Anemo, a researcher sent on a mission in a spaceship to a planet called the Formless Star to collect data on the many animals that live there. There's around 60 for you to find and learn about, all of them weirder than the next. You might find Flodeboller, a marshmallow-looking creature that hangs out in hot areas even though it's very uncomfortable with the heat, but just forgets it could leave any time it wants. There's Boy, who is a boy! Or Sylvia, an animal that evolved from a crashed spacecraft (you should definitely hang out with Sylvia, I would die for them).

Gameplay is pretty simple, you just kind of go up to each of these animals and interact with them, and then you get a Pokedex-esque entry that'll likely be a quirky goof. The world itself is randomly generated, changing itself every time you step out, different animals appearing on a fresh generation. 
</p>
<p>
It is primarily a game about vibes, those vibes being a funny, oddball, Game Boy Advance looking game with a, I want to say, healing soundtrack. It's just a lovely place to hang out for an hour or two, simplistic or not. Think of it almost like a walking simulator, but in 2D.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most impressive of all is how unique each of the animals feel. Something I often feel let down by in non-Pokemon creature collectors is how uninspired the designs are. I understand that that might come down to not having the resources, but the range of designs in Formless Star, a game predominantly made by a single person, splendidland, does kind of show that when it comes to this type of design work, you just need to get weird with it.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, it's pay what you want over on <a href="https://splendidland.itch.io/formless-star">Itch.io</a>! Meaning you can just download it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> if you like, or you can chip in a bit of dosh to support the dev. Which you should do, because it's a delightful little gem that has a nice simple message to it.

At a time where there is constantly word of this or that game shutting down, even successful ones, it will never fail to surprise me that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a> is still going. You can't play it on PS2 anymore, but there's still an active community on PC even now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> just celebrated its 23rd anniversary yesterday in fact, with a new update video and <a href="http://www.playonline.com/pcd/topics/ff11us/detail/22548/detail.html">letter from the producer</a> Yoji Fujito released to highlight some of the new and upcoming features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, in a future update more monsters are getting added to Limbus. There's also a new morale gauge system coming to Besieged that gives your forces a stat boost. Perhaps most interesting of all is a feature you might take for granted in modern MMOs, which is the introduction of the character race change service. Dodgy name aside, this will allow you to change your character's race, gender, face type, hair colour, and size.

<p>
Updates over the last year even added in something as small as gamepad configuration adjustments, and as big as a new master trial, Wing of War.
</p>
<p>
Fujito's letter further explained that even now, the team is looking to help new and returning players, particularly solo ones, have an easier time with the game. Currently there's something called the alter ego system, which is similar to Final Fantasy 14's trust system in that you can recruit NPCs to help you on quests. According to Fujito, the devs will be looking to allow you to upgrade these alter egos "as a means of enhancing the solo player experience." They have other plans to smooth things over too, which is honestly a little wild to me for a game that's been running for so long.
</p>
<p>
I've not dived into Final Fantasy 11 myself, there's always too many games for me to play to even consider touching an MMO. Still, it's comforting in a strange way that knowing that it's there, trudging along, ready for myself or anyone else to give it a go. Kudos to the team!

Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">leaked</a> and then later confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">Stellar Blade</a>, that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque one with the jiggle physics cranked up to the max, would be coming to PC next month on June 11th. This was obviously welcome news to the kind of people who enjoy that sort of thing (more or less no judgement here). But it quickly became apparent that there was a bit of a caveat: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game isn't available to pre-order in all regions on Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, you'll probably remember how a lot of Sony published games on Steam aren't available in every territory because of their annoying PSN requirement. That was at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">dropped by Sony somewhat earlier this year</a>, so it's a bit confusing why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> isn't available in all regions. In fact, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> don't even seem to know why this is the case, as in a Dwitter post they explained that they are "closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our best to resolve most of it as soon as possible."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔸️We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.<br>🔸️As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in… <a href="https://t.co/JDimvKiKte">pic.twitter.com/JDimvKiKte</a></p>— StellarBlade (@StellarBlade) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
They also clarified that connecting a PSN account is "entirely optional and never required." It's clear they know how badly this has been received across the board by PC players, and it sounds like this has been a bit out of their hands.
</p>
<p>
Outside of trying to get this region lock problem sorted, Shift Up also sought to make it known that the "DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases", and the mods will be "fully supported without any restrictions." I'm sure people plan on making perfectly regular mods for this game. Definitely not having a vision of something weird and questionable, no sir.
