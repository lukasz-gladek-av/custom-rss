It's really quite interesting how, in a time where big budget live service games are doing anything they can to get you to continue playing (and importantly spend money on) them, the sort of spiritual opposite of this to rise out of this are games where you just hang out with a few buds doing silly nonsense that don't cost very much. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, Peak, you know the kinds of games I mean, and yesterday a new one I quite like the look of arrived: RV There Yet?
</p>
<p>
First of all, kudos on the naming there, developer Nuggets Entertainment, just an all timer of a pun. In RV There Yet?, you and a few other friends play as what I can only describe as "the kind of guy who thinks going on a camping trip with an RV out in the middle of nowhere is a good time." The concept is quite simple: your vacation is over, you're trying to drive home, but, uh oh, the route you took is closed, so you have to find another way back, and hijinks ensue!

<p>
That might mean doing the very dad core thing of getting out of the RV and pushing or pulling the air to suggest you need to reverse or move forward, replacing a tire, smoking a cigarette, using a pulley system to lift up your RV, fighting off a wolf, grilling frozen meat patties, putting on a cassette tape with some age inappropriate tunes. Dad core stuff! Not to mention the most important core feature, "hats."
</p><p>
It's possible that RV There Yet? ends up as another log in the friendslop fire, but I do find it interesting to see the ways that the core concept of "four friends goofing around" has been explored. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">Multiplayer</a> games typically don't appeal to me due to their frequently competitive nature, and while I don't have time for every single collaborative co-op game under the sun, it's nice to see online games opting for a different approach. Like Peak before it, RV There Yet? was a made during a game jam, once again showing you how limitations can often lead to some neat results.
</p>

You can pick up RV There Yet? on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/">Steam</a> now.

You might be currently wondering where the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is, seeing as it hasn't turned up yet, and to explain its absence developer Arrowhead have taken to the game's Witter account with a post going into some details about it. Apparently it was originally planned for Tuesday, i.e. yesterday, October 21st, but a "last-minute certification issue caused a delay."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the studio is currently aiming for a release by the end of the week, with "staff ready to work over the weekend if needed." On that point, hope you pay good overtime and will give said staff members time off in kind, Arrowhead! However, you also shouldn't hold them to it, as they also say there's a chance the issue won't be fixed by this Friday, meaning the patch could be delayed even further into next week. "We’re doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding," explains Arrowhead.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Freedoms greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We want to share an update on our most recent patch. It was originally planned for Tuesday, but a last-minute certification issue caused a delay. The team is now targeting delivery by the end of this week, with staff ready to work over the weekend…</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1980996508657856792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
The post goes on to note how Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">pushed back things like Warbonds</a> to focus fixing up performance, and outlined some of the optimisations coming to the game whenever the next patch launches. This includes things like optimised status effects, physics, asset distribution and setup, VFX, and AI behaviours. 
</p>
<p>
There should also be reduced stuttering during the drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds, improved audio IO performance and general performance. Generally sounds like it'll be a good patch for smoothing over some of its current snaggly bits. You just have to wait a bit longer for it!
