<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/runescape-returns-as-an-open-world-survival-rpg-in-which-you-hunt-a-dragon-queen">just a couple of weeks ago</a>, and today developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/jagex">Jagex</a> hosted a livestream where they showed a deep-dive of the game and revealed the game's release date. Turns out, it's today! As in right now, today, as in you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">go to Steam to buy the game in early access</a> if that's something you'd be interested in.

This'll be quite a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> experience than you might be used to, though, as this spin-off from the long-running MMO is one of those open world, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, survival crafting kind of games. The Steam page makes it clear that the game is still "RuneScape at its core", as you'll have quests to venture out on, magic to use to craft homes and fight enemies, and there's even some "light RPG elements" too.

It's still a multiplayer experience too, as up to four of you can play together as you set out to slay the Dragon Queen. Oh, yeah, dragons aren't your friends unfortunately, you have to kill them, which I suppose is the traditional thing to do to the scaly creatures. Overall, it looks something akin to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>, albeit with that general RuneScapey vibe.
</p>
<p>
In a press release Jagex said they're planning regular updates for the game, with a big focus on "listening closely to the community" - hence the early access release, I suppose. I'm not entirely convinced by how the game looks just yet, I think it'll need a bit more of a hook than multiplayer survival crafting game, but it's RuneScape. The genre's just a bit too saturated these days. I like the sound of there being quests rather than just self-directed play as many games of its ilk tend to be, fingers crossed Jagex leans into that a bit to help Dragonwilds stand out.

Dear reader, allow me, if you will, a moment of honesty. I truly, wholly did not know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> was still going. Not only is it still going, but yesterday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shared a look at the game's impending second year of updates, so I really missed the boat on this one - pun intended, of course. The first season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> game's second year has already kicked off, introducing a few new features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters there's new world tiers, which are basically just optional difficult levels you can choose for certain challenges. Pick a higher tier, get better rewards, simple! There's item ascension now too, which lets you improve your gear with things like randomized buffs and "modifiable slots." Season 1 will be getting a mid-season update too that'll bring in a new PvP feature called Death Tides, essentially a capture and control kind of mode.

Season 2, which will arrive sometime this summer, will be bringing in playable large ships, but more notably, there'll be factions to choose from each of which have their own boons. Other factions will be hostile to you though, so take that into consideration. After that there's season 3 in the fall, with its biggest addition being land combat. Feels like something you'd think would be there from day one, but we all know how rocky a development period Skull and Bones has had.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, there's season 4, which is quite literally adding in a kraken. It's a pirate game! Of course you have to have a kraken. Outside of that there's the addition of the Hunters Guild, you won't be surprised to hear that it focuses on hunting sea creatures, and there'll be a new large ship to be acquired too.
</p>
<p>
If the fact that Skull and Bones is continuing to receive updates has convinced you to give it a go, perhaps hold off on buying it, as the game is getting a free weekend this week, from April 17th-21st. Can't say I saw this game lasting longer than a year, so kudos to the devs for keeping things ship shape - pun intended, of course.
