            <p>
I really don't think it's appreciated how much of a powerhouse Analgesic Productions are. Comprising just two developers, Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, their work always manages to present new takes on established genres, or games that have become genres. There's both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> 1 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne-2-return-to-dust">2: Return To Dust</a>, which borrows from various Zeldas in fresh ways, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sephonie">Sephonie</a>, an involved and conscious take on the 3D platformer, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/angeline-era">Angeline Era</a>, a nonlinear action-adventure game inspired by the early Ys games and Irish mythology, which just got a release date.
</p>
<p>
That release date is December 8th, a date that'll arrive faster than you realise, but let's put the inescapable passage of time to the side for the moment and focus on why this game has won me over so much. If you didn't know, my own name, Oisin, is Irish, and comes from a myth itself. Seeing as we don't see much Irish mythology in games all that much, you can see why I'm down to clown off the bat. But a concept does not sell me on a game.

<p>
What does sell me is its execution. That Ys-inspired gameplay comes in the form of its bumpslash combat. This works wonderfully simply: you bump into an enemy, you slash at them! Some enemies are easier to slash than others, some may jump, or produce spikes, or can't be hurt from particular directions. Said bumping applies to pretty much everything too, you have to bump into NPCs to talk to them, bump into chests to open them, into items to pick them up. There's a real sense of playful simplicity, an attitude of "how can we apply our main verb anywhere and everywhere?" that you can feel just from its demo alone that I adore.
</p><p>
There are mysteries galore too. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> of old, it has an overworld to traverse, but it's up to you to find levels to explore. It doesn't matter what order you do them in, just go out there and search every nook and cranny you can. Once again there is a design mentality here that feels retro, but sorely missed. There's no handholding to be found here for the most part, it's just go out and do/ seek the thing; at one point I was even told that I wouldn't be told how a particular mechanic works, and that I'd figure it out. I did! How delightful.
</p>
<p>
If you want to give Angeline Era a go yourself ahead of its December 8th release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393920/Angeline_Era/">there's a demo on Steam</a> - or just wishlist it!

            <p>
Right, here's your prescribed dose of actual nice news in the games industry for the week. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is back from the dead! Despite a decade's worth of development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the game was canned</a> with Hypixel Studios forced to completely shutter. Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">did say he wanted to talk to previous owner Riot about re-acquiring Hytale</a>, and as it turns out, that's exactly what he did!
</p>
<p>
"A new and exciting chapter for Hytale begins today," begins a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">blog post</a> from the Hytale Team. "We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games. While it didn't make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible."
</p>
<p>
The good news continues on from here, as apparently more than 30 developers "who know this game inside and out" have been rehired, "with additional returns expected in the coming days. Together, we are going back to the original vision for Hytale. We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years." Gosh, ain't that just a nice thing to read for once?
</p>
<p>
Said blog post outlined a few behind the scenes bits too. For one, the game has switched back to the Legacy Engine it was being made on previously, with the game now being playable and the post explaining that it "lets us build a game rather than an engine. It's the version that feels like what Hytale was supposed to be."
</p><p>
In the coming days, an early access date will apparently be announced, and pricing alongside that. Setting some expectations, the post notes that early access will take at least a few years, and that at launch the game will only feature exploration mode, creative mode, and modding - no minigames or adventure mode, but they are both still planned. Good luck with it all, Hytale team!
