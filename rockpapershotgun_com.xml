            <p>"Where’s my Neo-Volkite pistol, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>?" was my perhaps slightly ungrateful reaction upon booting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game up after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-rolls-back-difficulty-changes-that-made-fighting-xenos-intense-and-stressful">the previous patch</a>. "I didn’t even know what a Neo-Volkite pistol was until five minutes ago, but now this whole game is trash until I get one!." As promised in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">roadmap</a>, the last big update added a whole new Operations map, complete with a gargantuan new pseudo-boss in the form of a hierophant bio-titan. It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.</p>

<p>Patch 4.5 - which you can read about in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4472730495692571054">detail here</a>, if my whimsical summaries aren’t fucking good enough for you - indeed adds the Neo-Volkite pistol. It’s a new sidearm for the Assault, Vanguard, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> classes, and it’s described as "a powerful thermal ray weapon." As per the above trailer, it differentiates itself from other weapons by firing a continuous beam of hot. I’m a big supporter of any gun that makes me press the triggers less, especially if I’m already hammering the parry button like a maniac.</p>
<p>Alongside the pistol, there are also a few tweaks to other weapons. These include:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Plasma Incinerator</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly reduced amount of heat generated by normal and charged shots for versions:</li>
</ul>
<p>Master-Crafted - Alpha</p>
<p>Salvation of Bakka - Alpha</p>
<p>Gathalamor Crusade - Alpha</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause several versions not producing heat at all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Sniper Rifle</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire rate increased from 50 to 60 rounds per minute.</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x2 to x2.5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Occulus Bolt Carbine</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope added</li>
<li>Headshot bonus increased from x1 to x1.33</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolt Carbine (SMG)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted damage falloff curve: Base damage increased by 50% for the first 10 metres, after that, the damage drops to the original pre-patch value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Auto Bolt Rifle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Max ammo increased by 1 magazine for each version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also a few bug fixes, but that’s more or less it for this one. We’re still due some new enemies next year, and based on the correct consensus that the brick spongehouses of Tzeentch aren’t all that fun to fight, I very much hope we’ll eventually get some orcs. Space Marine 2 is great, but god knows it could use just a crumb of levity.</p>

            <p>My strongest and most enduring memory of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a semicolon and a dash in the same game name.</p>
<p>If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.</p>

<p>As reported by<a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/"> Rockstar Intel</a>, the ‘Classic Lightning’ mode was a feature added last year when Rockstar released the Definitive Edition games on mobile in partnership with Netflix. The mode - which is now available in all versions as an toggleable graphics menu option - apparently “restores the look and feel of the sky in the original games”.</p><p>I can’t confirm this, but according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-has-been-updated-on-pc-and-consoles-with-all-the-improvements-from-the-mobile-versions.1033440/">this Resetera thread</a>, the new update has also removed remaster-ers Grove Street Games from the splash screen, which seems incredibly gross and petty, whatever your thoughts on the quality of the release. Take-Two gonna Take-Two, I guess.</p>
<p>In other news Grandiose, Theftacular, and Automatic, Take Two are currently "highly confident" about a fall 2025 release date. That’s ‘Autumn’, for those of you who don’t break down in histrionic convulsions upon seeing a photograph of some beans on a bit of toasted bread.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
