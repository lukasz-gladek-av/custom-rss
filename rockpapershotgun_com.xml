If a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell</a> remake fell in the woods, would over the top industry secrecy and NDAs even allow us to hear it? That's the million dollar question literally no one is asking, because who phrases things that way, but enough about that game that may or may not exist at this point in time, we've got a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> to talk about: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-blacklist">Blacklist</a>. Yes, the, technically speaking, most recent entry in the series just received a little update on Steam yesterday which… <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/235600/view/519711795144819220">adds achievements into the game</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 12 year old game that did in fact release on other platforms, where it also had achievements, so why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have decided to add them in now all this time later is anyone's guess. Seriously, I'm sure this is something that at least one person wants, it's just such an odd thing to do.
</p>
<p>
There is a slight caveat to the announcement that mostly depends on how much you like achievement hunting. Ubisoft explains that "achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game." That means if you've already played the game on PC you'll have up to 28 achievements already achieved, for lack of a better word. Oh, and don't worry, all 19 online achievements that you needed online services for haven't been added in, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-give-online-services-for-older-games-a-stay-of-execution">those services aren't actually offered any more</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate that a game this old has received a little update like this, but you can't help but wonder what's going on with that remake. The last real update for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">back in 2022</a>, where some concept art was shown off. Since then… not much else has materialised. It's no secret that Ubisoft have been struggling for a while, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Tencent having to give them a whole lot of money recently</a> to keep things running. Maybe with some cash coming in, the time for the remake is almost upon us.
