            <p>BioWare currently has no plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> expansions, according to reports. Instead the studio will support the fantasy RPG with smaller updates and otherwise turn their full attention towards Mass Effect 5.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">report</a> that there are no plans for DLC, in favour of focusing on the next Mass Effect, in a piece speaking with Bioware creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>Although Rolling Stone confirm no specific details, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">report</a> that they understand BioWare intend to release quality-of-life and smaller content updates for The Veilguard, but nothing more.
</p>
<p>BioWare have traditionally supported their games with substantial story DLC. The previous game in the series, Inquisition, received several, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-dlc">Jaws Of Hakkon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-dlc">The Descent</a>, and an epilogue, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Trespasser</a>.
</p>
<p>That said, video games are harder than ever to make and The Veilguard already took Nic 50 hours to complete for his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. I am personally fine with story-based games being complete at launch, and not getting a bunch of extraneous bottle episodes and post-credits really-real endings post-release.</p>
<p>(Except for Cyberpunk 2077 which I wish had ten more in-development expansions about Idris Elba looking at me sadly.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-legends">The Elder Scrolls: Legends</a>, the free-to-play card game set in Bethesda's fantasy world, has been removed from sale on Steam. Its servers will shut down for good on January 30th, 2025, after which it will no longer be playable. The closure comes five years after the game was last updated.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364470/The_Elder_Scrolls_Legends/">Steam page</a> displays a message at the top that notes it is "no longer available on the Steam store." An in-game message announces the closure.
</p>
<p>"The Elder Scrolls: Legends servers will permanently shut down on January 30, 2025," begins the message. "From now until January 30, 2025, all items in the store and entry into in-game events will be available for 1 gold each, so you can enjoy all the content Legends has to offer. On that date, servers will be shut down and the game will be inaccessible. Thank you for playing and we hope you have enjoyed your time in Legends."
</p>
<p>Brendy wrote in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-legends-review">Elder Scrolls Legends review</a> that it "improved on Heathstone in an incremental way", elevated by its rune system and held back by its Elder Scrolls setting. That was in 2017 and ongoing development on updates and expansions ceased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-legends-development-on-hold">just two years later</a>.
</p><p>Obviously Legends never found a huge, adoring audience, but as ever I find it infuriating that live service and free-to-play games are just a slip-and-slide of unpredictable length pointing straight into a bin. No offline mode, no chance of finding an audience in future, just: bin. It's an awful way to treat your customers, and a terrible thing for video game culture in general that so much work is discarded so easily. Is any other medium so shortsighted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.
</p>
<p>It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

<p>If Typing Of The Dead was a riff on House Of The Dead - almost a mod of it, really - then Blood Typers is most obviously riffing on the original Resident Evil. You're moving around a spooky space, collecting bullets and other resources, managing your inventory, and finding keys to unlock new areas.
</p><p>Three-letter words appear on the ground that when typed cause your character to move to that spot. If there's an interactive element - an item to pick up, ladder to climb, jump to make - you can perform the action by typing a command with a preceding slash, like in text adventures of old. '/climb up' to scale a ladder, for example. You'll also need to use your left and right shift keys to rotate your character, to cast a flashlight into all the dark corners of each room.
</p>
<p>Might I prefer if this was a rail shooter, with movement not your concern? Maybe, but it's undeniably tense knowing that enemies can come from all sides. There are advantages to the more expansive framework, too: aside from different characters with their own skillsets, Blood Typers supporters co-op for up to four players, meaning you can all be clearing rooms together or exploring different parts of the procedural environments.
</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go for yourself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790330/Blood_Typers/">over on Steam</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
