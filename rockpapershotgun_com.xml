            <p>If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it. </p>

<p>It's coming out on April 24th. Anybody squeak through in time? Good. You'll be able to enjoy the Persona-style turn-based combat, and probably have sprightly enough reflexes to hit the quicktime prompts at various points mid-battle (although the QTEs "aren't forced on you", we've been told - so maybe you can simply turn them off). This newest trailer, shared during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, also shows off some of the ways you can traverse the world, at one point using a big beetle-like friend to swim and fly over long distances. We've already seen the combat in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55rUagD9sVQ">a previous trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur definitely has an interesting hook. The idea is that every year a big mortal countdown gets shorter, and a bunch of people over a certain age instantly dissolve into the air. Human lifespans are being mystically contracted, the various stages of life compressed into a smaller and smaller box while the remnants of humanity struggle on in the ruins of late-nineteenth century France. All the while the world seems full of weird critters painted into existence by a distant madwoman. Previously, developers Sandfall Interactive have revealed that Andy Serkis of Gollum fame is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/4529024222446556926">among the English voice cast</a>. Although my bet is that his is a small part.</p><p>As for the title. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is certainly a bunch of words in some order with a number attached. The eyes pass over it like a faded road sign. It might say something important under all the grime and vowels. But it might also just be a picture of a windsock. Let us be generous and say the baroque title is just another example of the game following in the footsteps of JRPGs, right down to the often impenetrable naming conventions. Laxadolia: Menacing Shards X. Sephical Lights: Code Wonder. QsY XIV: Last Awakenons. Yes, sir, these are unique Google terms. </p>
<p>Edwin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noughties-style-jrpg-clair-obscur-wants-to-recapture-the-glories-of-lost-odyssey-with-a-touch-of-devil-may-cry">peered at a preview demo</a> of the game with a curious raised eyebrow, drawing parallels not only to Persona games but the old Xbox 360 games of the mid-2000s, such as Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, not to mention similarly alt-history JRPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>. Edwin is dead now, though, lost some Expeditions ago. I too was lost in Expedition 36, making my thumbs too dusty and incapable of saving this particular fantasy world. But maybe, come April, some of you will make it through. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
How many times can video games riff on that one Dr Who episode with the weeping statues? At least once more. Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don't Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.
</p>
<p>
It's out in early access today. Yes, they've sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

<span>DON'T GET GOT - Early Access Trailer | OUT AT 5PM GMT TODAY</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kWWMeePLMg?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1kWWMeePLMg?autoplay=1">

Going by the video, the little boys only move when you're not looking at them, or can't see them. You probably don't need a PhD in Who to know what kind of play strategy this adds up to: keep that torch topped up with batteries, travel as a pack while looking in different directions, and try not to turn your back on any empty space. 
</p><p>
The trouble is that some of the objectives seemingly require you to take your eyes off the environment - operating a music box while staying perfectly still, for example, or using a scanner. The other trouble is that you have a sanity bar - not sure what the effects of running low are, but I doubt they are helpful. The other other trouble is that some of your friends are bastards. I mean, the game encourages them to be bastards. I'm not calling your friends bastards, with the exception of, you know, <em>her</em>. "Use the environment and collaborate with other players until they no longer serve your needs," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467390/DONT_GET_GOT/">Steam page</a> summarises.
</p>
<p>
Don't Get Got began life as a gamejam project, and will be in early access for around a year. The current build includes one map, game mode, character and enemy type. The 1.0 release "will definitely have more content in terms of maps, characters, enemy types, items and so on". They're also "intending to use this period to test some radically different ideas, which means there may be experimental features that we try in EA but decide not to ship in the final version."
</p>
<p>
While impressively ghoulish in itself, Don't Get Got does feel a little like yet another claimant to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s throne that doesn't have a fraction of that game's cosmic grotesqueness. The title is also a bit How Do You Do, Fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kids">Kids</a>, not that I'm in a position to judge.
</p>
<p>
Still, I'm a fan of Dr Who's Weeping Angels - it's one of two episodes of modern Who I've ever watched, the other being the one with the library where the shadows eat people. I also quite like Bossa, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surgeon-simulator-and-lost-skies-devs-bossa-studios-lay-off-a-third-of-staff-due-to-perfect-storm-of-events">who've been through rough times recently</a>. So I may yet find time for a trip to the schoolhouse.

            <p>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South Of Midnight</a> sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.</p>

<p>It's coming out April 8th. The trailer was part of yesterday's Xbox Developer Direct, and it shows a little more of the protagonist's motives, as well as the mythical and human figures who will both help and hinder her. We catch a glimpse of Huggin' Molly, for example. A <a href="https://www.spiritshack.co.uk/blog/ghost-stories/huggin-molly/">legend of Abbeville, Alabama</a>, Molly is a ghostly (and again, tall) figure who is said to stalk any kid out late at night. She will grab, hug, and scream at you if she catches you. I don't see the problem. Sounds like a normal granny to me.</p>
<p>This trailer marks the third big glimpse we've had of the marshy misadventure. One previous trailer showed us how the player will bash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witchy-swampy-action-adventure-south-of-midnight-gets-a-proper-gameplay-trailer-with-island-sized-alligators">a big-armed miniboss bozo</a>, and fly across the bog in the company of crows. While the release announcement introduced us to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-happy-few-devs-reveal-south-of-midnight-a-new-action-adventure-set-in-a-magical-realist-american-south">long-limbed guitar player called Shakin' Bones</a>. If you're really desperate to follow more of the development, developers Compulsion Games have also made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLBOyKqw58A">a 30-minute "making of" video</a> that talks more about the music, influences, and ideas behind the story.</p>

<p>Compulsion are the studio who made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-happy-few">We Happy Few</a>, a first-person survival dystopia with some creepy character design and a strong theme (alternate history Britain in the 1960s where everyone is on drugs). But it was also a little jumbled when it came to actually playing through the story, said John in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-we-happy-few">our review</a>. I'm still keen to get my hands on this new swamp-and-slash of theirs though. The music alone seems worth a look. Or a listen. You know what I mean.</p><p>Meanwhile the Xbox show also revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 remake</a> that was released immediately onto Steam (haha, what). And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-may-15th-2025-heres-everything-we-learned-from-ids-press-show">a release date for Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, which is also coming out in Spring. That's good. Let this long winter end. Let the games flow forth.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
