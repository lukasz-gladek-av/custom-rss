            <p>The second of two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> updates Bethesda told us all they had up their buggy sleeves arrives in Steam Beta later today, July 9th. This one's update 1.2, and it's headlined by the sorts of performance improvements folks have been begging for, plus some difficulty setting tweaks.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, The Elder Scrolls 4.something's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-has-two-bug-fixing-updates-coming-sudden-glitchy-vampire-baldness">last update</a> did many things, but by fair the most noteworthy was stopping a vampire from succumbing to the urge all men get. That being the urge to become bald so you can save like £10 a year by no longer buying shampoo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for update 1.2, which you can check out in full via the Tweet embedded below, Bethesda's kicked off by outlining how it's switched up the settings that control how hard you get Mehrunes Donkgoned by enemies and how much damage you inflict by donking them back.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," they wrote. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players." I personally preferred yanking the slider on a bar that provides next to no info as to what exact difficulty you're at, but hopefully this helps folks out.</p> <div>

<p>Beyond that, here are the much-requested tweaks the update makes to Oblivion Remastered's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">not always so hot performance</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>
<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>
<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>
<li>Optimise updating of character attachments.</li>
<li>Optimise rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>
<li>Optimise light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>
<li>Optimise waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>
<li>Optimise the weather system.</li>
<li>Optimise character animation system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully all of that means you get more of the fun jank, and less of the jank that is the equivalent of a stranger taking a big poo on your living room carpet. Unless, of course that is your definition of fun. To each their own.</p>
<p>The update's out via Steam Beta first, with a full release on PC and those other platforms to follow at some point down the line.</p>

            <p>Back in June, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of alleged undocumented migrants in Los Angeles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests">provoked a wave of protests</a>. The Trump administration attempted to make hay from the situation, dispatching federal military troops to the city in a show of toughness, against the objections of California's own governor. Despite this cynical cultivation of a pressure-cooker atmosphere, the majority of protesters were peaceful, albeit justifiably loud and angry at having their neighbours seized and imprisoned by random thugs at the behest of a dime store Palpatine.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I was in Los Angeles at the time covering Summer Game Fest, and saw a few of the protest marches up close while walking across the city. Aftermath has <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-los-angeles-protests-ice-immigration-police">a good, longer report</a> on the unearthliness and angst of attending a game expo right in the middle of such events, including comments from other journalists and developers.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles protests and the Trump administration's wider policies on immigration have provoked additional demonstrations across the USA. They've also inspired an Itch.io charity bundle, <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california">"No ICE in California"</a>, which spans 560 video games, physical games, game asset packs and other items from 268 developers for $10. Hosted by jesthehuman, the bundle has raised $26,712.19 as of the time of writing, with proceeds going to the <a href="https://www.immdef.org/">Immigrant Defenders Law Center</a>, a Los Angeles law firm who specialise in defending immigrant communities, and <a href="https://raicestexas.org/about">RAÍCES</a>, a Texas-based immigrant advocacy and support organisation.</p>
<p>As is RPS tradition, I've picked out a few bundle highlights. <a href="https://linker.itch.io/eleflipside">Elephantasy Flipside</a> (pictured) is a glorious isometric single-screen puzzler, the kind of thing I'd have had kittens over if I'd found it on a MacWorld shareware disc, back in the 90s. <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a> is a crushed and grimy immersive sim in which you are a knife-wielding cockroach. <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">Periphery Synthetic EP</a> is a set of reactive, musical solar systems that can apparently be explored using echolocation and terrain sonification, if you're too cool for screens. And <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/centauri-dark">Centauri Dark</a> is a gut-emptying rainbow of a bullet hell FPS.</p>
<p>Got highlights of your own? Please share. Beware that if you've bought other Itch.io charity bundles, you may own some of these games already.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-charity-game-bundle-raises-funds-to-defend-us-immigrants-against-ice]]></content:encoded>
