            <p>
Good, bad, I don't bloody know yet the thing's only been about for five seconds, but we can certainly say one thing now: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-the-new-fps-from-former-apex-legends-and-titanfall-devs-hits-steam-early-access-after-weeks-of-teasing-silence">Highguard is out</a>. Now we can sit and prepare ourselves for more inane and pointless discourse about yet another live service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> that we've probably had several times before. Hooray! But before we get ahead of ourselves, a moment of reflection, courtesy of the devs behind Highguard itself, who have spoken out about all that silence following their Geoffies reveal.
</p>
<p>
"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better," Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch explained to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ultimately-we-could-have-made-a-different-trailer-highguard-ceo-responds-to-that-poorly-received-game-awards-reveal/">PC Gamer</a> in a new interview. "Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback. 
</p>
<p>
"I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think [The Game Awards] was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient."
</p>
<p>
Welch went on to note that Geoff Keighley is a "friend of the studio" and had played the game prior to reveal, apparently saying he'd "love to do something different and put an indie studio and a free-to-play game" up at The Game Awards. Let's pause for a moment here to highlight that the use of the word indie here feels quite disingenuous, given that Wildlight is a 100+ person studio. Independent, sure, but we all know roughly what indie means, and it's not that. You made bleedin' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, come off it!
</p><p>
Anyway, design and creative director Jason McCord also explained that the trailer at The Game Awards was just meant to be a reveal, and then they'd keep quiet. "The plan was to announce, go dark, and then the next thing that we want players to see is the game. If the reception had been totally different, it would have been the same plan. The key is, you've got to play the game." Essentially, an attempt at repeating what Apex Legends achieved on its launch.
</p>
<p>
I probably won't play it, however, as it really doesn't look to be my thing, so I'll let you lot be the ones to decide if this one gets to stay in the very empty hall of live service shooters.

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye! Embark have shared some more concrete details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raider's</a> next main update, Headwinds, which is set to be downloaded onto your platform of choice tomorrow, January 7th. Namely, just what that new matchmaking option is, which is, as it seems, one that won't be for everyone.
</p>
<p>
As previously detailed, this new matchmaking option will only be for those of you that are level 40 and upwards, because it allows you to fly solo into a lobby filled with squads. Aye, that means it's just you and the whims of individual groups. Apparently this particular matchmaking mode will net you extra XP, but that sounds to be about it for now. Doesn't sound particularly worth it given extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>' whole thing, but hey, I'm sure some of you out there like the thrill.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>The ice has thawed - Unprepared Raiders have fallen, the hardy survivors must press on. Here’s what’s coming tomorrow when Headwinds launches!<br>Solo VS Squads<br>• A new matchmaking option for LV40+ Raiders, take on full squads as a solo Raider for higher risk… <a href="https://t.co/Rg69cT3gil">pic.twitter.com/Rg69cT3gil</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2015832160020697466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
There is also a new trophy display feature, which allows you to harvest those nasty old ARCs for "prizes," with a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/headwinds-content-update">blog post</a> explaining, "Build out your trophy case, progress through the levels, and unlock valuable items in the process." On top of that, you might start to notice flocks of birds flying around particular spots on the Buried City map. Head to their nests and you may find some convenient loot, but of course this'll be something everyone can find, so keep the challenge in mind as well. Lastly, there's a couple of new cosmetic sets, like the Sandwalker set for some stealthy vibes.
</p>
<p>
Nothing too game changing to be found here, though that new solos vs groups option sounds like it'll be a bit contentious. You can probably place bets on a future patch tweaking how much XP you do or don't get. In any case, Embark recently outlined a bunch of other plans for the game slated to arrive over the next few months, which you can have a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-devs-reveal-plans-for-new-large-arc-a-fresh-map-two-expeditions-and-extra-matchmaking-options">here</a>.

            <p>Created by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, Highguard was the final game announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">December 2025’s Keighley Awards</a>. It’s a free-to-play, guns &amp; sorcery, PvP raid shooter in which magic cowboys in capes vie for control of an uncharted continent. It’s got temples, airships, rideable panthers, fireballs, frost giants, and enchanted siege engines on caterpillar tracks. It’s also out now on Steam. That was quick.</p>

<p>Highguard has kindled a lot of curiosity by having almost zero marketing - a pleasant reprieve from the usual drip-feed of pre-order bait that has provoked acute withdrawal symptoms among news writers addled by years of character spotlight trailers. Geoff Fest trailer aside, the game has cruised along on the strength of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">the following scanty Steam blurb</a>: “From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<p>I’m not particularly enticed by that elevator pitch, but I do like me a setting that can’t decide whether it's Call Of Duty or God Of War. I also approve of the developer’s possibly calculated silence following the announcement, because it has really annoyed a lot of people and I am a deeply pathetic human being. Pranksters have sought to fill the breach: a fake Bluesky call for fan art last week <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/will.bearwaves.com/post/3mcwfihuups2g">attracted</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsutter.bsky.social/post/3mcwsm6232c2m">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tannerofthenorth.bsky.social/post/3mcwt6wmm7k22">few</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vforvalensa.bsky.social/post/3mcwxrlopgk2g">responses</a> of the “I’m John Highguard” variety.</p><p>James included Highguard on his personal list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">most anticipated PC games of 2026</a>, despite observing of the aesthetic that “you could lose track of it in a bowl of porridge”. I’m a bit warmer on the visuals than James, but I can well imagine Highguard vanishing without trace. Still, I am also one of the many who didn’t see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> becoming more popular than bread. Perhaps we’ll look back on Highguard’s pre-launch period as a successful example of always leaving ‘em wanting more?</p>
