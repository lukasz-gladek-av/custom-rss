            <p>An alleged cryptocurrency scam that models itself on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be launching on Steam this week, despite Valve's promises that they do not allow NFT or blockchain games to exist on the platform. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-xrpl">Paradise</a> has been advertised as an action game set in a sunny city which will allow players to drive cars, shoot enemies, and earn money. But its in-game currency is based on blockchain technology, and some reports allege it is a scam based in Russia which does not allow its crypto investors to withdraw funds. When asked why the game is allowed on the platform, Valve have repeatedly neglected to comment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Paradise will be releasing into early access on April 2, say developers Ultra Games. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_c9D63YNm4">recent trailer</a> shows a player inspecting guns, walking through a garage full of cars, and navigating a world split up with loading screens made with AI-generated art designed to look like the loading screens of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Previous trailers boast that you can speak to any NPC using AI technology. </p>
<p>"Play with your friends, engage in shootouts, race cars, complete daily missions, and reach the apex of life," reads a blurb. "Earn money and buy what you want, from real estate to fancy clothes." The creators have boasted that the game is in Steam's top 200 most wishlisted games. It's possible many of those Steam users aren't aware of the game's grubby features and history of misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Paradise uses a currency called the $PAR token which is based on blockchain technology, and can be invested in via a third-party app. Some investors in this cryptocoin claim they became unable to withdraw funds, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-copycat-paradise-is-an-alleged-crypto-scam-yet-continues-to-gain-steam-wishlists">we reported in January</a>. The developers have also falsely claimed to be working with streamers such as Ninja and Pokimane, and included unlicensed use of a Lamborghini and other cars in previous trailers. </p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ultra Games</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Together with a lot of AI slop and very heavy use of Unreal Marketplace assets, the game had enough red flags that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">multiple YouTubers investigated the company</a> behind it, with one discovering that the Hong Kong address listed by the company was fake and eventually discovering that it is actually based somewhere in Tbilisi, Georgia - a city with <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/project/scam-empire/diamonds-dior-and-dubai-vacations-the-luxurious-lives-of-georgias-call-center-scammers">a troubled history when it comes to blockchain scammers</a>. </p>
<p>"Versions of the game for Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation Store will not include cryptocurrency, ensuring there are no restrictions for users on these platforms," say the developers in a <a href="https://paradisevs.com/company_statement2">defensive rebuttal</a> on their website. Unfortunately, no one can verify the developer's claims until the game is released. But even if a means to buy the currency is not present in the final release, it wouldn't restrict the game from redirecting players to the third-party cryptocurrency app necessary for players to earn and spend the game's $PAR token in-game. An act which, in itself, could be harmful to users, even if Valve’s terms of service don’t specifically forbid this. Since the game can still serve as a Trojan horse for hooking people into an alleged crypto scam.</p>
<p>On top of this, the document which insists cryptocurrency will not be in the game is full of other misleading statements, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4RvTrS-nE">pointed out by video creator Jetro</a>, one of the YouTubers who previously investigated the game. The developers claim their use of a minimap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> is allowed, for example, because "The GTA 5 map is based on the real layout of Los Angeles, which is not intellectual property". To avoid doubt: the GTA 5 map is not a 1:1 reproduction of Los Angeles, and Rockstar own the rights to that map. </p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-is-banning-games-with-nfts-and-cryptocurrency">banned all games that feature NFT and cryptocurrency</a> in 2021. The Paradise developers have edited the game's Steam page a number of times since it first appeared, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3281420/history/?changeid=U:56561021">removing trailers that mention cryptocurrency</a>, for example. It's unclear if Valve have been in contact with the developers or not. I have asked Valve for comment on this game multiple times and have not received a response. </p>
<p>The game is also launching <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-9e47b6">on the Epic Store</a>, but only after it was removed once and reuploaded as "Paradise XRPL" , with a store page that clearly states it is an NFT game, along with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-faq-9f3b93">an FAQ on its crypto gubbins</a> which insists that it is good for the game. "The introduction of a crypto token in PARADISE XRPL enhances the product by enabling streamlined transactions for in-game purchases, facilitating trade between players, and granting access to exclusive content." I have also asked Epic Games for comment and will let you know if we learn more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>'s dev team are "actively looking at" adding options for a more challenging jaunt through the throaty-poke 'em up's incarnation of feudal Japan. "We're looking at these things and monitoring what people say about the game," creative director Jonathon Dumont told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar+</a> at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>Shadows currently features four difficulty options for both stealth and combat, ranging from 'story' to 'expert', as well as the 'guaranteed assassination' toggle from recent previous entries, which ensures that when you stab a man in the neck with a large sharp piece of metal, he does not react with a blasé "ow! Nevertheless…".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Being a modern Assassin's Creed game, however, the difficulty can vary wildly depending on whether you like mopping up optional content for shiny trousers, or just want to play the story or explore the world in peace, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">like our Brendy</a>. I finished the game last week, and ended up whacking the difficulty down about half way though. Not because I wasn't enjoying combat - but because there was too much of it, and it was getting in the way of me riding around on horseback enjoying some of the best bad weather in gaming.</p>
<p>If you're someone who craves even more gruelling tests of swordsmanship, however, it sounds like the team are listening. "Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p>
<p>Ubisoft, perhaps intent on increasing the difficulty settings of life for their own employees (flawless segue, Reuben), recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">spun off a new subsidiary</a> in charge of Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six - a move which has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7311779591268790273/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAClMqgoBaeBIo2OcUoqKuxcXOQfn_umcwu8">allegedly devalued shares that staff were encouraged to take</a> in lieu of other bonuses.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Coffee Stain remain dissatisfied with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, their first-person factory sim, despite Matt Cox giving it the Cox's Orange Pippin Award in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/satisfactory-10-review">Satisfactory 1.0 review</a>. They're just about to release update 1.1 into public testing. This adds Photo Mode, programmable personnel elevators, and a bunch of twisty furnishings. 
</p>
<p>
One thing it doesn't add is rain, which used to exist in Satisfactory but was removed because it wasn't working properly. Apparently, Coffee Stain need to do an Unreal Engine upgrade before they can restore the missing precipitation. Many players are sad about this. Ah, I think it's kind of poetic that there are people in the Satisfactory community who wish only to be rained upon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's a video in which the developers break down update 1.1's additions.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty7GdZvCETo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
And here's a quick summary of the highlights. They're adding branches for hypertube networks, allowing you to shoot down one or the other branch as though switching rails in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a>. They've got some fancy new throughput counters for conveyor belts so that you can easily track how many items a line is carrying. The editor now supports curved building modes for belts, and straight building mode for pipes. There are also new vertical belt splitters and mergers for people who like to expand upwardly, perhaps because they've covered every inch of available soil in metal.
</p>
<p>
New bits and pieces include railway buffers to close out railroads, and the aforesaid personnel elevators - more of a cosmetic flourish in a game with jetpacks, perhaps, but you can customise what the buttons do, and I imagine Satisfactory players will find many arcane applications for such functionality. Just don't use them to transport vehicles, because the game will act as though you've chucked a bunch of forklifts onto a bouncy castle.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least - proper controller support for your Eggbox and PlayStaycation peripherals! There's no final public release timing for the update yet beyond its experimental branch rollout from tomorrow, 1st April. That choice of release date is obviously cause for suspicion, but the developers assure us in the video that, unlike the Cox's Orange Pippin Award, update 1.1 is a real thing that exists.

            <p>"Alien Ant Farm or we boycott," reads the top comment on Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1905290954191298620">recent reveal</a> of the next wave of tracks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> - a response to the revelation that the upcoming remasters have both been hit <em>and</em> struck by some soundtrack changes, which hasn't gone down completely smoothly with fans. You could almost say they feel making alterations to such classics is criminal. OK, I'll stop. For now.</p>
<p>It turns out these changes come straight from the large Hawk himself. “It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST,” he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-explains-controversial-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-changes-it-was-my-choice/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride. More to come… both old and new.”</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely buy this, for no substantial reason other than I've grown too weary to accept such chummy reasoning for anything a publisher the size of Activision does ever. Still, I reckon you've got a point there, Mr. Tony 'Tony Hawk' Hawk. The original games's role in introducing US skate punk and hip hop to a huge audience outside the states was undeniable, as was its influence on baggy jean and wallet chain sales. Giving exposure to some lesser known bands is no bad thing, even if I'm personally devastated by the<a href="https://youtu.be/yFA7c7uK5Ks"> loss (or lack of mention so far) of AFI</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hDolkBP98Mg">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose this might have gone down better if it wasn't for the already announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-career-mode-timer-1851768305">changes to THPS's career mode</a> (Kotaku), which is getting replaced by time challenges ala the prior games, though there'll reportedly still be a free skate option. </p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/">out on Steam</a> July 11th, 2025. I assume so much licensed music means they'll be a robust option for streamers. Otherwise they might get copyright-struck down. Possibly in the bedroom. It'll be their doom, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list.

<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
