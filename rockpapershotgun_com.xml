            <p>
When you review a game, if you don't know anyone else that's also reviewing it, it can be a bit difficult to guess how it might be received overall. There's normally some assumptions you can make, but with a series like Silent Hill, a series where the general consensus is all over the place from game to game, it's certainly not easy to predict. I myself ended up being quite fascinated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">review of it</a>, but in a recent interview series producer Motoi Okamoto said that despite an overall positive reception, you shouldn't expect every consequent game to be just like it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g">IGN Japan</a> at TGS last month (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/future-silent-hill-games-wont-necessarily-follow-silent-hill-f-formula-producer-says-we-want-to-keep-experimenting-with-each-new-title/">Automaton</a>), Okamoto said how he expected responses to the game much more divided than they ended up being due to its "challenging" elements. This is where the but comes in. But! As he notes, "that doesn’t mean every future Silent Hill will be like Silent Hill f. Each one will have its own distinct flavor. We want to keep experimenting and be ambitious, both in terms of gameplay design and storytelling, so please look forward to the next Silent Hill as well."
</p>
<p>
The producer doubled down on this sentiment on <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537">Bitter</a>, the nothing app, saying he wants to be bold with the series and make it so that each subsequent game offers fresh gameplay. Though he doesn't want to abandon a key point about the series either - "I believe psychological stories are essential to what makes Silent Hill feel like ‘Silent Hill,’ and we’ll continue to place great importance on that in future works as well."
</p>
<p>
Part of the process I took with reviewing Silent Hill f was working out my own feelings on how necessary the series is now, and if there's anything it can offer any more. The answer, as it turns out, was yes, actually, so despite my curmudgeonly attitude towards it, I am curious to see where it goes next.

            <p>
Right, there's just a constant wall of bad news at the moment, so how about something a bit nicer. Earlier this year, Summerfall Studios announced that the Kickstarter for their demonic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> didn't work out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kickstarter-for-dragon-age-writer-david-gaiders-demonic-deckbuilder-malys-didnt-work-so-here-it-is-in-early-access-instead">so they'd be releasing it in early access instead</a>. Much like Kickstarters themselves, early access releases are risky business too, but it appears that at the very least it's worked well enough to grant the game a 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Summerfall shared word of this very fact yesterday, revealing a release date of October 23rd in the US and Europe, or October 24th in Oceania. "There are a million more things we’d put into Malys if we had the time and runway, but we’re so proud of where we’ve been able to get the game to, and how fun it is to play," Summerfall explained in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">devlog</a>. They also shared that you can expect them to be quiet in the lead-up to launch as they deal with last minute bits of feedback, as well as getting as much actual video game into the video games as possible (plus a bit of polish and "pizazz").
</p>
<p>
In terms of what to expect from 1.0, don't go too attached to your current save file, as it'll be completely reset when the update drops. With the full release, there will be a completely playable story, three regions to get through, a big music update, and the cherry on the icing, a final boss fight. Plus, there are double the "amount of random encounters, or the numerous new cards, curios, demons, consequences and rewards."
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been ensnared by Malys' dark and mysterious ways, it's one of those roguelike deckbuilders, one where you are a former priest turned demon-hunter who is going around a ruined city performing exorcisms. Summerfall Studios, quite notably, was also co-founded by original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so there's certainly some veteran skill attached to the project.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to pick up Malys now if you're at all interested, as the price will be going up slightly on launch - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449690/Malys/">it's available on Steam now</a>.
