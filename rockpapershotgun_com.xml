            <p>You already knew hectic 1v1 bullet sprayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> was going to add 2v2 matches and a four-player free-for-all mode. You knew because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutalist-shooter-straftat-teases-a-four-player-free-for-all-mode">I told you months ago</a>. Don't pretend you forgot. Please, it's insulting. Anyway, the update that adds these modes arrived yesterday and it also adds - surprise! - a ton of new maps. Which brings the game's total number of killing arenas to over 300. Straft THAT, other shooters. </p>

<p>"We're happy to launch today the official 4 Players Straftat update FOR FREE," yell developers Lemaitre Bros in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/497201025048904106?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>, probably in an effort to be heard over the sound of gunfire. "It includes both 2v2 and Free For All (1v1v1v1). Team matches can be 1v2 and 1v3 as well. This was by far the most requested feature for the game since release back in October. We hope these new gamemodes will meet your expectations."</p>
<p>I just played a bunch of matches and I left smiling as widely as ever. Having a rando teammate to carry my carpal tunnelled corpse through each burst of low-stakes, quickfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> murder certainly helped. The free-for-all matches were just as snappy, and there is a familiar glee in avoiding a straight fight and stealing that last kill with a snipey shot from across the map to win the game. God, it's wild that video games can just be good, you know? YOU CAN PLAY THIS FOR FREE.</p>
<p>The update also adds a heap of new maps, a practice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">the developers continue</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">a frequency</a> that would drive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-map-makers-map-more-maps-into-straftat">a man to madness</a>. There are ten new free maps, plus an extra 28 maps for DLC owners. Although note that even matching up with someone else who owns the DLC will let you play the maps you don't have. There are some new weapons too, the devs say, including a "Curved Knife" which boosts jumping, and a couple of fast-firing but low-damage machine guns.</p>
<p>I've only devoted a few hours to this shooter, yet I can't help but recommend it. It is pure, old-school adrenaline administration software. You bumslide and wall run and miss nine out of ten shots in a wild panic when your foe appears around the corner. You can lose and lose and lose, and never care, because a round lasts about 30-60 seconds and how can you get annoyed about ragdolling across the map when you're already shooting rockets again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-shooter-straftat-gets-a-2v2-update-and-if-my-maths-are-correct-this-makes-it-twice-as-intense-1v1]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I hesitate to call <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> "the best organ trading sim of 2021", because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cruelty-squad">Cruelty Squad</a> also came out in 2021 and I worry about starting a localised flame war. But it means Strange Scaffold's sci-fi stockbroker sim was, at the very least, 2021's <em>second</em> best organ trading sim. Nice to see it's getting a sequel then, called... oh no. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-baby-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a>.</p>
<p>"We aren't monsters. You aren't going to be trading babies," says head of studio, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You're going to be trading stocks based on babies, which means you can short a baby." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game was announced as part of an online showcase held by Strange Scaffold. They also showed off upcoming co-op cook 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> which looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo">staffed by drunk medieval monks</a>. A third game, Truck-kun Is Supporting Me From Another World, was also announced, although it's only about a week into development, says Nelson. It is "a chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world." Of course.</p>
<p>As for the spleen brokering sequel, there wasn't much to see yet (it's also still early in developement, says Nelson). But we're told it will be a continuation of the grimy space tycoon's desperate search for high profit margins in the realm of interstellar commodities. In a galaxy where shareswappers can literally tell the future to a high degree of accuracy, speculating has become harder and harder. The last refuge of the Wall Street scoundrel lies in extraterrestrial baby trading.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>There is no confirmation yet that Chad Shakespeare will return.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"In the future, technology has been established that lets people observe macro trends, see whether a war will break out as a result of current conflicts and so on and so forth. This makes a lot of speculative markets flatline because speculative markets are basically just gambling. And the last thing that remains for an up-and-coming investment broker to get into for true speculative trading action... uh... is babies. </p>
<p>"You will be buying alien baby stocks, selling them, shorting them, and in general trying to make as large of a profit as possible," he goes on, calling the sim "the next major effort in us exploring this series around what happens when you apply capitalism to space." </p>
<p>Strange Scaffold has released seven games in the last two years, Nelson reminded press at the start of the showcase, which is, yes, quite a high rate of fire. Although it's maybe only achievable thanks to the studio's rotating squad of part-timers, each of whom brings their own interests and quirks to the table.</p>
<p>"The studio has been part-time people since its founding because it added different dynamics to who we could hire and how we could hire them," said Nelson. "So I will say that the studio is and has been a part-time location for folks, but there has also been a deep tension that's been introduced by the fact that a lot of folks are increasingly not having day jobs to return to. And we're trying to support people as best as we can through it while not having resources to bring anyone on full-time or take up that load that the wider industry should have."</p>
<p>Both Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator and Truck-kun will be coming out "within the next year". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-short-a-baby-in-the-sequel-to-space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Put down that cursed bag of frozen curly fries and come here. I've spotted a game you might like. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> is essentially the four-player hangout horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> but instead of ghost hunting you are collecting ingredients to feed a big monster its favourite dish. </p>
<p>"This isn't a place of honour," says studio head of Strange Scaffold, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You aren't going to be making fancy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>-style dishes. You will be beating a giant rat or a minotaur with a rolling pin, taking an object from their corpse, throwing it onto a grill on a beach, and then firing it into a kaiju's jaws with a catapult or a manganel." Checks out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Strange Scaffold are the studio who made adrenal shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and freaky hotel horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a> (among many others). They were showing off the ravenous kaiju as part of a showcase that would kick off the "Summer of Strange". Which is sort of like when Nintendo announced the "Year of Luigi". Everyone laughed back then, but what followed was many consecutive years of Luigi. These are the dark methods of manifesting reality through marketing. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the studio showed off the game with a short playthrough. You play as a cohort of monks who have to cook a meal for a Kaiju while exploring a dungeon for the best ingredients. There are rats who can steal cloves of garlic and tools out of your hands. You can cook a fruit pie using the same flaming torch you use to light your way. At one point in the demo we watched Nelson discover a "spice fall", a kind of interdimensional portal raining spices from the ceiling. It'll season anything in your inventory if you stand beneath it, flavours sure to delight (or infuriate) the kaiju. </p>
<figure>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and the like, there's a lot of panicked running around and comical miscommunication. People bleed, flammable puddles are set alight, traps threaten to sever the body parts of the players. If a player dies, their heart pops out. When a team mate brings that heart back to the surface, they can be revived. </p>
<p>Eventually, Nelson gathers a loaf of bread, toasts it, and the gang finally catapult it at the giant monster. Nelson also gets in the medieval catapult (or mangonel) and dies in the sea. "We've tried to find the right terminology for the type of catapult thing we've got and we've learned that that's just a failing endeavor even with a historian on board." This would also be why the game's list of features makes certain notes about food availability. "No tomatoes," it reads, "since they were only introduced to Europe in the 16th century."</p>
<p>As with a lot of co-op streamer bait, there's proximity voice chat baked into the game, and you're not meant to hear everyone all the time. But without radios the studio needed another way for players to talk as they roam from cobwebbed pantry to cobwebbed pantry. So there are "speaking tubes" you have to talk into to chat over distances. A tinny reverb adds a ghostly feeling to the sound of voices flowing through them.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It's all openly reminiscent of the ever-popular and streamer-friendly co-op horror games already mentioned. Last week some bozo in the bowels of the internet derisively called this subgenre of games "friendslop" - a judgy yet admittedly catchy phrase that sneers at the relatively low development costs and roughhewn nature of such games. Developers and fans on social media subsequently had a shit-fit defending this type of game, as if the term itself threatened the millions of sales <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> has already achieved. By contrast, Nelson doesn't really care about the drama around the word, and is more buoyed by the idea that a genre has simply been born.</p>
<p>"I think it is an interesting way of talking about this set of highly consumable, highly digestible, low-cost, low-commitment multiplayer experiences. I'm not offended by it. I'm not particularly excited by it either. I just think that it's interesting that this is enough of a subcategorization of things that players and press and content creators have found a word for it."</p>
<p>I'm not sure we'll see "friendslop" become neutral in the same way that "walking simulator" has become. (It too began as a jeering insult, about games deemed to lack enough action and player verbs, yet is now basically divorced from that negativity.) Whether "friendslop" sticks around or dissolves into obscurity, it's reassuring to see that at least one developer isn't fazed by the name-calling. </p>
<p>"I hope to make a game, as with all of our games, that is more than the cheap joke," says Nelson, "but also very silly and a little janky and lives up to being just another cool thing we made."</p>
<p>Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out July 29th and Strange Scaffold promise "a minimum of two months of post-launch support, expanding and updating the game". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm always in two minds about this stuff. Obviously, if you think something's valuable, just pay people to do it. Mods can add years to a game's lifespan and while there's no way to guarantee a modder with that sort of talent is going to grace your game over others, offering a big wad seems like a surefire way to increase the odds. I am by no means saying this is what 11 Bit are doing here, but I will say that disguising requests for free labour as fun opportunities with fabulous prizes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record">does have a precedent</a> in games. I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of entrants are going to make the game's modding scene a lot more vibrant suddenly and not win anything.</p>
<p>Still, modders getting rewarded is always great, the prize pool is likely funded at least in part by <a href="http://mod.io/">mod.io</a> themselves, and if you're someone who's just beavering away making free mods anyway, then why not.</p>
<p>There are separate categories to enter, with prizes for the best mods in politics, the city, frostlands, and graphics. Here's 11 Bit from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405?l=english">blog post</a> on the competition:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What is the jury looking for? Creativity, playability, and most importantly, fun! After all, you are the strategy genre experts, and we would like to see what you will come up with to make the Frostpunk 2 experience even more interesting. New stories and mechanics? Insane mode? Replace snow with sand? Add dinosaurs? Introduce a swamp with ogres? The Steward would rejoice!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ogres, you say? To enter, you'll need upload your work to  mod.io, with a #fp2modcontest tag. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2248517364">Big Butt Skinner Balloon</a>, please. Do it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/put-big-butt-skinner-in-frostpunk-2-win-10000-maybe]]></content:encoded>
