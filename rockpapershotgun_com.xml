            <p>For too long have our video games been tainted by the spectacle of people moving around using their own feet and legs. For too long have our NPCs been left to rot in the grip of "simple town life", surrounded by acres of thriving grass that have never known the blessed touch of a Chevron or a Ford, let alone that duchess of the asphalt - the Banana Mobile.</p>
<p>All that changes... well, they haven't shared a release date yet, but rest assured that Car Park Capital will soon be here to transform all of your awful virtual countryside into a sea of rumbling isometric bonnets. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Car Park Capital is a satirical business <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim in the tradition of Rollercoaster Tycoon, built using a custom rendering engine. Your job is to tarmac over the world's last remaining stretches of vegetation and fill the screen with neat lines of parking places, plus the occasional zebra crossing for those pitiful pedestrians that yet remain, shaking their fists at the uncaring sky.</p>
<p>Any townsfolk who object to driving must be persuaded otherwise using propaganda. You can, for instance, put up billboards with dastardly mind-control slogans such as "you love cars", "how about a nice car, eh" and "eat smog you filthy little piggies". I may have invented one or two of those, but I did not invent the below bullet points, lifted direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031880/Car_Park_Capital/">the Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and citizens.</p>
<p>Per-person behavior simulation: Each person is different, except they're all bald.</p>
<p>Play into their minds with propaganda.</p>
<p>3D map editing: Be creative when designing car parks or other buildings. You can make multi-floor structures.</p>
<p>Expand as the demand increases. Get rewarded accordingly.</p>
<p>Elevators!</p>
<p>Retro styled graphics with a playful color palette.</p>
<p>Moddability: Scripts and content can be altered if you possess some Lua skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not quite clear how the levels work from the trailer, but I wonder if each map starts out as a proper settlement, and your goal is to stealthily insert and obfuscate roads until the commutes become endless and the gridlock becomes self-sustaining, allowing you to remove the homes, shops and businesses like Jenga blocks, without interrupting the circle of fumes and frustration. Regardless, this is a lovely visual confection for all its baleful premise. These are the best cars I've seen in a game since, oh, let's say Rollcage.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://hilkojj.nl/">Hilko Janssen</a> is based in the Netherlands, and is a Ludum Dare game jam regular. I like <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/hapman-the-inevitable">this thing they made</a> about a fly trying not to get eaten by Pac Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ahoy, consumer of PC games! I fear that Void War may be highly relevant to your statistically determined interests. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> combat game in which you steer ancient, crenellated starships through a frightful cosmos of blood cultists, imperial zealots, and ravening corsairs. You will warp from node to node on a roguelite system map, with each node harbouring battles, story encounters, and the occasional friendly or at least, not immediately hostile face such as a merchant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To say that in less: this is Subset's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> but set in something very like the despairing galaxy of Warhammer 40,000. It is flatplan offbrand Battlefleet Gothica. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only the mood trailer, below.

The full game is out 30th May, and there is a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war">Itch</a>. I have played that demo for about 20 minutes. Here are some exciting things that happened: I got a new recruit killed during a boarding action; I blew up a cultist vessel crewed by reanimating ghouls and some kind of skull wizard, who kept doing psychic sabotage on my engines; I found some vials of demon worms behind a horrible astral altar, which I am saving for the next skull wizard. 
</p>
<p>
All very enjoyable. Perhaps a bit too familiar? It's been years since I played FTL, but this often feels identical. Engagements unfold in real-time, but you can pause to micromanage. The basic trick is to allocate reactor energy between your ship systems, especially your shields and weapons, while ordering your crew between rooms to operate systems and deal with invaders or hazards like fires. 
</p>
<p>
The art direction is also a bit plain for a project riding Games Workshop's coat tails - I need more grot, guts and greebling, damn your eyes. Still, the setting feels adequately horrendous. For example: I have just installed a cannon that gives other ships the plague. I entertain high hopes of recruiting a skull wizard of my own.
</p>
<p>
Going by the breakdown of the backer alpha on the Itch.io page, the full game will offer in the region of: 10 playable ships, eight playable commanders, 70 crew types across six factions, 60 kinds of weapon, 50 modules and 19 ship systems, plus 140 crew items. There is possibly a Warhammer 40,000 FTL mod that does some or all of this already. If you know of one please educate me. If you find all this too grimdark, consider playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breachway">Breachway</a> instead.
