            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot looked like an excellent addition to the immersive sim genre. Based on Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">previous shuttering of Arkane Austin</a>, I can only assume that this made Phil Spencer very angry. "Why can I lift massive crates but only fit one rifle in my inventory!", roared Spencer. Subsequently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">both the reboot and studio The Initiative were axed this week by Microsoft</a> as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure their legacy going forward is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">destroying livelihoods</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">participating in</a> what a UN rapporteur<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session59/advance-version/a-hrc-59-23-aev.pdf"> describes as</a> an “economy of genocide”, and forcing Copilot inside that little plastic bit at the end of your shoelaces.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a few great immersive sims from the Steam Summer Sale to soothe the bastard wound of Perfect Dark's cancellation. The bastard wounds inflicted on everything good and real by stakeholder capitalism, I cannot help with. Only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a> could fix that. None of these are especially deep cuts, so do let me know if I've missed out anything <em>spectacular</em>.</p>

"Hallucinogenic hypercapitalist critique wrapped in a kevlar jacket of impenetrable irony", <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-review">reckoned Brendy, early access reviewishly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/">Gloomwood </a>is 25% off at £12.50/$14/€14.50. It's in our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc#gloomwood">best immersive sims</a> for a reason. (The reason is Brendy put it there.)</p>
<p><strong>Bonus mentions:</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/">Dread Delusion</a> veers a bit toward the RPG side, but I'm counting it. 20% off.

Yes, it counts! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2788210/DEEP_STATE/">Deep State</a> isn't out yet, but I've seen it described as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> meets Goldeneye", so in it goes. Ditto <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594120/Brush_Burial_2/">Brush Burial 2</a>, but with dominatrix takedowns. These weren't in Goldeneye, although I suppose you could describe escorting Natalya as a sort of deeply unfulfilling BDSM. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/">Project Silverfish</a> just launched in early access with a 16% discount, and has a demo.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected by Microsoft's slashing and burning. Seems exceptionally callous and short-sighted from where I'm standing, though I am just a simple country lawyer with no understanding to how these big brain business geniuses operate.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-five-great-immersive-sims-microsoft-didnt-just-cancel]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaks</a> have earned it a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">Deadlock-style buzz</a>, but it seems things haven't been going well behind-the-scenes. A new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">Ars Technica</a> based on conversations with current and former developers details a budget that's beyond big, a campaign that's running "massively late" following a studio closure, and an unrealistic-sounding executive goal of attracting 100 million players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, the game codenamed Glacier is costing EA "well north" of $400 million, with that number being way more than any entry in series has previously commanded. The execs have their eyes set on competing with Call of Duty and Fortnite, so they've put plans in place for a single-player campaign alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">free-to-play battle royale element</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">classic multiplayer modes such as Rush</a> and "a community content mode" dubbed Portal all chucked into the big FPS stew.</p>
<p>That scale has reportedly also led the suits to slap Battlefield 6 with equally huge goals: "100 million players over a set period of time that included post-launch", according to one source. "Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," an EA employee told Ars, with another adding that "over about that same period, [Battlefield] 2042 has only gotten 22 million." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, believed to be the series' peak, has apparently attracted "maybe 30 million plus" in total, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-looking-to-bring-battlefield-premium-type-service-to-more-properties">shifting about 15 million copies</a> between its October 2011 launch and June 2012.</p>
<p>It'll probably not surprise you to learn, then, that "very few people" actually working on the game reportedly believe the 100 million figure is achievable, with much resting on there being "such an appetite out there for shooters of this kind that we will just naturally be able to get the audience that we need".</p>
<p>The rest of the report details the game's single-player element as running "massively late" following EA's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">February 2024 closure of Ridgeline Games</a>, something that could lead to a massive day one patch, delayed features and/or devs being pushed extra hard to fit everything in before deadline.</p>
<p>There's also reportedly tension between staff at long-time Battlefield developers DICE in Sweden and the newer US-based leadership team EA drafted in for the series, and Ars have heard "several first-hand accounts of people working on Glacier who had to take stress or mental or exhaustion health leave, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months".</p>
<p>All in all, it doesn't sound like a game that'll be fun to get over the line. We're wishing the best to the devs on the ground working on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Three former higher-ups at Ubisoft have been found guilty of sexually and psychologically harassing the women who worked for them at the company's Paris studio. A French court handed out suspended sentences to the three executives, as well as fines, the highest of which was €45,000. It's the final ruling in a sordid trial that has seen the men accused of forcefully trying to kiss female employees, ordering them to do handstands in skirts, and angrily throwing equipment across the office. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Former editorial vice-president Thomas François was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault, as reported in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">The Guardian</a>. The court handed him a three-year suspended prison sentence, and a €30,000 fine for the crimes. </p>
<p>François was accused of tying a woman to an office chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. Another woman told the court how she was forced to do handstands when she came to work in a miniskirt. </p>
<p>"He was my superior and I was afraid of him," she said. "He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him."</p>
<p>At a themed Christmas party in 2015, François said he liked a female co-worker's 1950s style dress, then allegedly tried to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her. During the trial, François put much of his behaviour down to a "culture of joking around". Another Ubisoft staff member put it differently, calling the culture at the studio a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse">"boys' club above the law"</a>.</p>
<p>At the same trial, Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer at Ubisoft was found guilty of  psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment, although he was ultimately acquitted of the charge of sexual harassment itself. He got an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a €45,000 fine. </p>
<p>The court heard that Hascoët's alleged bullying behaviour includes ordering assistants to do personal tasks unrelated to their jobs, such as going to his house to collect parcel deliveries. The court heard how he once blew his nose into a tissue and handed it to a young woman working for the studio. "You can resell it," he allegedly told her, "it’s worth gold at Ubisoft." Hascoët's lawyer said that the former Ubisoft chief is considering an appeal. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Guillaume Patrux, a former game director, was found guilty of psychological harassment. He got a 12-month suspended sentence, alongside a fine of €10,000. Patrux was accused of a variety of harassing behaviour which includes drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, throwing office equipment around, cracking a whip near colleagues faces, and holding a cigarette lighter so close to a male employee's face that his beard caught alight. All three men had denied the charges.</p>
<p>The trial's verdict brings some level of justice to those women, although many complaints which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">surfaced back in 2020</a> have not necessarily been addressed. Back then Ubisoft responded to an outpouring of allegations that overwhelmed the company, saying that they would investigate those stories. When these and other allegations came up throughout Ubisoft's worldwide studios, some workers reported that HR had been informed, yet nothing ever happened. In the end it took the force of France's policing and legal system to do anything about it, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">the arrests in 2023</a> of the above accused and two other workers. We've asked Ubisoft for their comment on the verdict.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hey, deez two. Sorry, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has just gotten a fresh patch following on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-new-update-adds-in-more-weapon-variations-boss-challenges-and-oh-no-a-really-hot-portrait-for-narcissus">beefy Unseen update</a> last month. The big news? Supergiant say this latest batch of tweaks "will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch".</p>
<p>Damn, maybe it's time for me to dive back in and get some extra practice taking down those pesky sirens that try to smite you mid-gig like they're aquatic Van Halen. Ok, maybe I actually mean fire the game back up to stare at Narcissus. Sue me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512962085601150265">Patch 10</a> largely consists of tweaks to the stuff added in by the Unseen update, as well as some handy general fixes. That said, the most noteworthy aspect of its notes is Supergiant revealing: "We'll keep monitoring your feedback, though this will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch, whenever that will be!"</p>
<p>So, still no full release date for the godly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> yet, but further confirmation that we're getting perilously close to its emergence from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access</a>, which'll see Melinoë's story get its "true ending".</p>
<p>Anyway, to help tide you over, let's get into the highlights of this patch. Supergiant have reduced the chance of "successive attacks causing you to become 'stun-locked'", as well as making sure any temporary armour you've got from the likes of Hephaestus' Security System is chipped down by damage before it starts affecting your regular protection.</p>
<p>Several of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms and their aspects have been boosted up or tuned down. The Sister Blades' omega attack is now uninterruptible by enemies and the Umbral Flames' omega special projectiles do more damage, but orbit more slowly. The Argent Skull's omega special wave projectiles don't stagger folks anymore, and the Black Coat has had several aspects of it buffed.</p>
<p>Patch 9's Oath of the Unseen looks to have been rendered a bit more difficult via tweaks to the Vow of Frenzy and Vow of Scars, with the former drafting in fresh foes more quickly and the latter now reducing your recovery as intended.</p>
<p>Other changes affect everyuthing from boons, to Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and hexes. One other fix that's caught my eye ensures that "Heracles no longer sometimes ominously just stands around after his encounters". Maybe he's just been waiting for news on that full launch date, Supergiant. </p>
<p>Right, now everyone disperse promptly. We can't just ominously linger, Hades 2's devs might start digging into our code.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld]]></content:encoded>
