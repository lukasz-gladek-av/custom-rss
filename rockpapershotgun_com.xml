            <p>I did not expect to meet Mozart in Shovel Game, nor did I expect him to ask me to mine a pyramid of shit, with the helpful advice that I start at the top to avoid any floating shitbricks. Mozart is probably the least interesting thing about Shovel Game, actually.</p>
<p>It's a shortform first-person oddity with Minecraft-style destructible voxels (yes I know Minecraft doesn't really use voxels) and a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">AHL_5am</a>. The idea is to tunnel through "a sequence of strange and unfamiliar spaces". Here's a trailer.

<p>Only certain blocks can be mined, and you'll want to dig with caution, because the catacombs are full of groaning, wailing sprites that look like Zordon from Power Rangers. It's as if somebody had cracked the glass on his energy tube, freeing the galactic wizard's blobby visage to wander the Earth in pain. Enemies kill you on contact and I've yet to discover any weapons, just my trusty shovel and an 8-ball - purpose unknown.
</p><p>It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3869670/Shovel_Game/">Steam</a>, but you can find <a href="https://lukewasthefish.itch.io/shovel-game">a demo on Itch.io</a>. Expect plenty of aggravation: there's a labyrinth full of oozy blue phantoms that requires fast footwork. Also a kind of cosmic chapel full of what appear to be flattened babies. The developer is Luke Vincent, who created it for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-002/entries">"shovelware horror" gamejam</a>, ho ho.</p>
<p>Bonus game mention: leafing through the submissions page for that jam, I discover a new work from Mike Klubnika, architect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-mike-klubnika">S.p.l.i.t.</a>, which Nic had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/split-review">eloquent emotions about</a>. Co-developed with James Dornan, Klubnika's jam game is called <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it">Crank It</a> and is about being stuck behind a set of gadgets in a cavernous hallway, trying to spot horrible creatures. Got to say, this sounds far worse than shit pyramid Mozart.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> began life as a DLC expansion, but then developers Team Cherry decided the concept was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-developers-announce-a-full-sequel-silksong">"too large and too unique</a>", and upgraded it into a full game. They spent six years working on the thing in almost total silence, while fulminating legions of the terminally online quietly drove themselves bonkers hunting for release date clues. We now have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-youve-only-got-to-wait-a-little-bit-skonger">Silksong release date</a> - it's just two weeks away - so in theory, the nightmare is over. Except, oh dear - Team Cherry are planning post-launch content for Silksong, and they're already calling it "ambitious". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">breakout interview</a> with Press X To Jason Schreier, the person who considerately does all the investigative reporting in games journalism so that humbler souls like myself can spend our days taking the piss out of him. According to Schreier, "they're already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come." Then there are some snippets from Team Cherry's founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," Pellen said. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."
</p>
<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," interjected Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p><p>
Those monsters! I look forward to revisiting this post in 2030, assuming RPS hasn't been turned into sausages by then, while writing up the latest rumours about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>: Polyestertune or Satinmelody or whatever they end up calling the third one.
</p>
<p>
Still, perhaps this is better interpreted as show of kindness. Earlier in the interview, Gibson and Pellen fret that by actually releasing Silksong, they're spoiling things for players for whom the real Silksong is speculating endlessly about the release of Silksong.</p>
<p>"It's nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they've obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it," said Gibson, diplomatically. Added Pellen: "Feels like we're going to ruin their fun by releasing the game." I guess this DLC tease is a bid to keep the dream alive, then.

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta is officially a Thing That Happened, and now comes the terrible ordeal of Learning From The Experience. Here is what developers DICE, Criterion, Motive and Ripple Effect have learned from the experience: you are all playing the game far too much like Call Of Duty. Goodness me, it's like 2007 never ended.</p>
<p>Doing headshots in midair? That's an updatin'. Doing a parkour while carrying a light machinegun? That's an updatin'. Bunny-hopping with prejudice? You'd best believe that's an updatin'. Never mind that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">those multiplayer reveal montages</a> emphasised footloose quickdraw almost as much as they incited a murderous contempt for helicopters. It's time to play Battlefield the way Battlefield should be played: lying in a hole praying that one of your team-mates spawns on you before a tank rolls over your head.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This, at least, is my addled Friday afternoon summary of EA's just-announced post-beta plans, via <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">Mecha-Hitler.com</a>. Let's squeeze into our thinking caps and break it all down.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the developers are doing a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons", to make them feel more unique, especially in terms of range. They're also making changes to encourage more controlled tap and burst-firing. In particular, the M87A1 shotgun has been defanged, and they're "investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences", with news of changes to follow.
</p><p>
As for movement, they want it to feel more "balanced and traditional" in the final version of Battlefield 6. There will be less carry-over of momentum and particularly horizontal speed from a slide to a jump. Jump height will also be lowered during consecutive jumps, and you'll be less accurate while jumping or sliding.</p>
<p>"These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable," the devs comment. You won't get as much acceleration when opening a parachute, either, "for more controlled aerial movement". I hate being in control of my aerial movement. In practice, it just makes it easier for people on the ground to shoot me.
</p>
<p>
The game's smaller maps are being tweaked to stop naughty people getting onto rooftops and venturing out of bounds. "This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas," the devs sternly explain. Bad ladder! Down!</p>
<p>They'll be testing two more maps in Battlefield Labs before release, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>'s Operation Firestorm and another map set in Mirak Valley, both of which offer "the full complement of vehicles" and "a more vast combat space". Vaster, EA, vaster! How am I supposed to trust you to fine-tune parachute physics when you can't even optimise your sentences. Yes, I realise I have just held up a red cape to all the amateur copyeditors in the comments.
</p><p>
Modes? Well, they've found that Rush gets a bit smeary when there are too many players involved. Apparently, "when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible", presumably because the attacking player's head and torso also become less tangible. As such, they're lowering the player count for Rush "to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode". 
</p>
<p>
Anticipating pushback on this front, the post points out that people can mess with the count as they please when playing Rush via the Portal editor. Breakthrough, meanwhile, will receive "map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders".
</p>
<p>
In general, EA are taking an ad hoc approach to player counts based on the individual map and mode. "For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64," the post comments. "It's the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps." They've found that "8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and [King of the Hill]". Again, you can jimmy the workings in Portal if you wish.
</p>
<p>
Some final bits: open and closed weapon playlists will continue to be available in Battlefield 6, "and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible". I'm not sure why that would be difficult? They're also trying to fix matchmaking so that you won't have too much difficulty finding games in which to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush.
</p><p>
Expect some of these improvements to materialise in forthcoming Battlefield Labs playtests. The game launches on 10th October. Our hardware editor James attended a preview event recently and came away with the verdict that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">"looks like a Battlefield game"</a>, thereby demonstrating the granular insight that got him promoted to CPU Wrangler First Class.</p>
<p>Even more granularistically, James noted that "there are also reasons to be optimistic that this is a series getting itself back on track, from its renewed emphasis on breaking shit to the replacement of show-off specialists with that old unspoken rule of 'Stick with your squad or perish.'" Did you play the beta? How did you find it?
