            <p>"<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed again, this time until the second half of 2025," Edwin wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delay-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-yet-again-because-technical-quality-is-more-important-than-sticking-to-a-date">March</a> this year. Today I write: Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been given a full release date at tonight's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, along with a fresh trailer.</p>
<p>To this point, the tale of Bloodlines 2 has been one of fan swearing induced by delays that have been a seriously regular occurence. Originally worked on by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">Hardsuit Labs</a>, the game's current devs The Chinese Room have said they're going for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more of a spiritual successor</a> than straight sequel. As of that last delay earlier this year, they were also very keen not to release it in as buggy a form as another Paradox project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to today, and Bloodlines 2's appearance at 2025's Gamescom Keighleyfest. It'll release on October 21st, The Chinese Room have revealed, narrowing down the previously given window to one date that's just about close enough to halloween.</p>
<p>You can check out the new trailer that revealed the new date above. As you'd imagine, it contains plenty of vampirey goodness, with the player literally exploding someone into a big blood splatter at one point by cheekily messing with their heart. As Fabien and Phyre, you'll be unravelling mysteries from the past and roaming modern day Seattle.</p><p>Everything keeps coming back to a tree surrounded by sunflowers in a field that's permanently coated in an eerie orange sunset hue, where someone's chilling out as they wait for Phyre. Hopefully Phyre's on time. Vampires, assuming this shadowy figure is one, can be sticklers for promptness, especially when dawn's nearing.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks pretty cool, speaking some someone who enjoyed The Chinese Room's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Scottish oil rig horror flick</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> last year. There don't look to be any Scottish vampires in Bloodlines 2, which is a little disappointing, but to be fair this is only a two-minute look at it. The real question, though, will be how well it matches up or doesn't with the expectations of the long-suffering crypt-dwellers who really dug their teeth into 	Troika Games' original Bloodlines. Especially given how much the vision behind it looks to have evolved as it's stalked through the night of a pretty tumultuous development.</p>
<p>We'll find out on October 21st, assuming no more delays are lurking down shadowy alleyways.</p>

            <p>Schoolgirl spookfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has gotten a fresh trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, ahead of its release in September.</p>
<p>In case you're out of the loop, this trip to the quiet mounds is developed by Neobards Entertainment, and sees you take on the role of Shimizu Hinako. Your hometown's foggy and there are weird doll creatures cracking about the place, bit all is well because there's no emotional trauma you can't bash into sumbission with a metal implement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, the new trailer showed more of Hinako disvoering how her hometown's been turned on its head, and offered a first taste of Suzie Yeung providing the pipe-wielding protagonist's English voice. Aside from that, there was a mysterious bloke in a fox mask chatting about Hinako saving his soul, so he's going to repay the favout by reclaiming her old life. Plus, some wandering through a temple and Hinako's old home, armed with a nanigata, as you do.</p>
<p>The time to press f, and by that I mean the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-gets-a-release-date-plus-a-creepy-new-trailer-with-more-limb-cracking-noises-than-a-chiropractor-convention">release date</a>, is September 25. You're in for horrors like weapon degradation that ensures your naginata falls apart at the same rate Hinako's psyche probably will. Seriously though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine">more action-oriented combat</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-thing-thats-sold-me-most-on-silent-hill-f-so-far-is-its-slightly-outdated-ui">slightly outdated user interface</a>.</p><p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town, she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?" That's what Konami producer Motoi Okamoto wrote in a PlayStation blog post about Silent Hill uncapitalised sixth letter of the alphabet a few months ago.</p>
<p>Roll on September 25, and a trip to Ebisugaoka.</p>
