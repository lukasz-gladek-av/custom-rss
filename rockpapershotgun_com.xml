<p>Time is ticking down until Geoff Keighley once again emerges from his fleshy cocoon, brushes the Garibaldi crumbs from his suit, and strides onto the stage to bellow his customary challenge of "Who wants some?". We assume he means games, but one day he will nut a developer in the front row and we won't be able to say he didn't warn us.</p>
<p>We're pulling together a quick rundown of everything announced at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a> so you don't need to risk life and limb by straying too close to Geoff's grasping fingers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're planning on staying up for the night, then a fine time shall be had by all who pull up a stool at James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">The Game Awards 2025 liveblog</a>. If, however you'd rather not trade a good night's sleep for an early look at trailers, then head back here tomorrow morning for a full list of everything announced at the show.</p>
<p>For the games we find most intriguing, we will be writing fuller stories which I'll link out to below.</p>
<p>What's that? The Game Awards haven't started yet? You could have fooled me, what with all the…</p>
<h2>Confirmed games at The Game Awards 2025</h2>
<h3>Total War: Mystery</h3>
<p>Those cheeky so and sos over at Creative Assembly held a livestream last week, a right poke in the eye for ol' Geoff. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">It's where they announced Total War: Medieval 3</a> (while also puncturing the excitement by saying it was still years from release). However, to salve Geoff's bloodshot eye, they also teased a big announcement for The Game Awards.</p><p>There have long been rumours of a Total War take on either Star Wars or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-reveal-likely-after-telltale-words-40k-spotted-in-creative-assembly-video">Warhammer 40k</a>. That could well live up to Creative Assembly's promise that "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era."</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest in June, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth main game in the series. Capcom had insisted that it wouldn't star Leon and would instead focus on new character technical analyst Grace Ashcroft. However, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">a leaked cover from earlier this week</a> certainly appeared to show everyone's favourite cop-turned-super-soldier, suggesting that Capcom's pants are a-blazing.</p>
<h3>New Tomb Raider</h3>
<p>Like a Roman emperor tossing another prisoner to the lions in the colosseum, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923">on Monday Geoff threw out a tweet teasing "a look at the future" for Tomb Raider</a>. Out in the world with all that hungry attention on it, someone quickly found the box art and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-the-next-tomb-raider-reboot-project-going-by-alleged-trailer-leak">reveal trailer for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. The trailer was taken down, but reports from those that saw it say it looks like a reboot for the series.</p>
<p>Confirmed game news is all well and good, but what about the more salacious stuff? The grimy things no one wants to stand by ahead of the night? You know what I mean…</p>
<h2>The Game Awards 2025 rumours</h2>
<p>Well, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming is the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake. It looks like it may be ready to eagle dive from the crow's nest with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">a PEGI rating for Assassins's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a> spotted just the other day. Presumably it's too late to rename the project? Something a little less of a mouthful would be lovely.</p><p>Being a Keighley show, Hideo Kojima is often lurking in the wings. With a recent ESRB rating for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach PC release, tonight could be the moment for an on-stage reveal. Maybe with some added director's cut gubbins thrown in?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is likely to win big at the awards tonight, so it would also be the perfect time for the team to reveal their next project. Be it details of an expansion of a tease of something more.</p>
<p>Now, finally, as long as I've been a games journalist, I've been hearing rumours of the imminent reveal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a>. Once again, with the advent of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and new Steam Controller, there's been more buzz about Gordon Freeman once again picking up his crowbar. I want it to be true, but I have no reason to believe it is true. Nor that Valve would announce it anywhere other than their own show. That said, I'm not going to say I'll eat my hat if it's announced, because under everything I remain an optimist.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this post throughout the night and, if all goes to plan, when you wake up tomorrow it will be chock full of trailers and game reveals. If not, well, let us salute my attempt.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">filled with squishy squids</a>. These squishy squids have since come close to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">squishing Super Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Also being squished in late 2024 were some players' positive perceptions of Arrowhead's gear pricing, as a Killzone crossover arrived and was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-suitably-festive-solution-killzone-collab-price-backlash">so throughly panned for being expensive</a> that the studio ended up giving the last bit of it away for free as a make-good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of December 18th, though, the Killzone gear'll be making a long-awaited return to the shooter's store with some extra additions to help it feel fresh. This time in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">warbond form</a> for the collective price of 1500 super credits, rather than as individually-sold bits which add up to cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>If you paid for all or even one bit of this Killzone gear when it was on offer last December, this new warbond'll land in your inventory for free, with no need to re-spend any medals either. Meanwhile, if you only got the bits given away for free in 2024 or are a player who's hopped into the game since then, you'll have to fork over those 1.5k super credits.</p><p>As for what's in the warbond, the answer starts with three primary guns. There's the drum-magged StA-52 Assault rifle, the up-close killer StA-11 SMG, and the precise, charge-based PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle. Two armour sets, the heavy AC-1 Dutiful gear and light AC-2 Obedient getup, go with those and come with the Acclimated passive ability, offering 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. Finally, there are the usual capes and paints.</p>
<p>While there's no evidence it's due to arrive anywhere near as soon as this Killzone warbond, assuming it does at all, Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-little-fanfare-helldivers-2s-creative-director-shares-that-arrowhead-are-prototyping-a-roguelite-mode">let slip the other day</a> that Arrowhead have been prototyping a roguelite mode for the buggy shooter.</p>

            <p>
You know that weird chime that plays when you find a secret in the classic Tomb Raider games? Play it now in your head. You weren’t alive when those games were published? I hate you. I hate you. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VhPV3ml7U">here you go</a>.  Great, now we’re ready to talk about the leaked images of Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which appears to be the new Tomb Raider game due to be announced at G-Star K-Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Game Awards show tonight</a>. Or at least, one of them.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The leaked images come via Resetera, with posters <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/">noting</a> that Lara Croft’s pose in the supposed boxart matches her pose in the teaser for a <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1998093291594883300">“future of Tomb Raider” presentation</a> at tonight’s festive Keighley-hauling. Hello Resetera users! I read your mean comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">our best PC games feature</a>. Spare me your kneejerk Blizzard fandom, you casuals. Still, all is forgiven as long as you keep filching alleged videogame titbits from Geoff Keighley's undies.</p>
<p>The screens appear to be trailer grabs, and show a freshly-revarnished Lara sporting her legendary blue top and twin pistols. There is minimal evidence so far of the screechy Croft mutilation we saw in the more recent borderline horror survivalism-themed games.
</p>



<p>
There is minimal evidence of much personality at all, to be honest. I confess, I’ve been sitting on this leak because, frankly, the images seem rather bland and recycled, to the point that I worried they’d been AI-generated for kicks using a combination of Lara Croft character models from various generations of Tomb Raiding. Mind you, that could be because this is a remake of the very first Lara Croft outing on PS1, spliced with the look and feel of the more recent Tomb Raider reboots under Crystal Dynamics. Lara’s gear in the image certainly gives that impression.
</p><p>
There have already been two Tomb Raider reboot trilogies, plus remasters of the first six games under Core Design. Tomb Raider has pillaged itself so often I’m not sure new varieties of Lara are conceivable. Still, please accept my totally original, never before expressed suggestion: why not, like, let Lara Croft age? Instead of resetting her every 10 years because entertainment culture at large has an institutional terror of older women in action roles?
</p>
<p>
Here is my other, definitely not original suggestion, inasmuch as I think I’ve written it on these pages before: pretty please Crystal, can you do a Tomb Raider franchise soap opera in which all the various incarnations of Lara hang out in their mansion and solve mysteries? I've got personalities worked out for each of them based on my expertise in 90s television. OG Lara Croft is the Phoebe, Angel of Darkness Croft is the Joey. Legends and 2013 Croft are Monica and Chandler. Ross gets to be Lara Croft Go and Rachel can be that Game Boy one I've forgotten the name of. Look, roll with it for fuck's sake. This is still more convincing than a Croft who can't seem to grow out of her twenties.
</p>
<p>Terrible jokes aside, I hope Crystal Dynamics make this work. They've been through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">layoffs</a> in the past year. Best of luck with tonight's announcements, all.
