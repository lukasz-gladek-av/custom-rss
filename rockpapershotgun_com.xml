            <p>Sure, you could tease around the edges of generative AI videogame development, spitting out an Anno 117 loading screen here, belching out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> NPC voice barks there, or you could just go the whole hog and hook your characters straight up to an LLM. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>In related news, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wuxia-mmo-where-winds-meet-is-full-of-ai-chatbot-npcs-and-people-are-doing-all-the-standard-obscene-stuff-to-them-i-made-him-think-that-my-character-was-pregnant-with-his-child/">cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer</a>, players of Everstone Studios wuxia-themed RPG Where Winds Meet have got NPCs to provide them with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oy22k0/you_can_chat_with_npcs_and_they_respond_as_an_ai/">cooking advice for potatoes and ketchup</a>, plan a travel itinerary for a trip to Beijing, and they've even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">convinced one guard that they're pregnant with his baby</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you interact with NPCs in the game, rather than be presented with set options of what to say to the characters, you instead have a chat box in which you're free to type whatever you please. Those lines then are sent off as a prompt to an LLM and then you receive a response somewhat tailored to fit the personality of the character which you're speaking to.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oy22k0/you_can_chat_with_npcs_and_they_respond_as_an_ai/">in one interaction shared on Reddit</a>, a player asks "What can I cook at home? I only have ketchup and potatoes". The NPC then replies, "(thinks for a moment, then suggests) You could make fried potatoes and use ketchup as a sauce. It's simple but can be quite tasty." When the player asks if ketchup was available during the Song dynasty, the NPC replies "No, ketchup wasn't available [...]. Tomatoes weren't known in China back then."</p><p>The interactions can lead to tangible outcomes, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oyd1gw/been_waiting_for_games_to_use_ai_like_this_lol/">NPCs you anger kicking off fights</a> or increasing your reputation. Though, even then players are finding you don't need to act in good faith, instead simply implying positive actions can be recognised as such. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxoe11/comment/noz3ssv/">As one Reddit user points out</a>, if you see a hungry family, telling them "I'll give you food" results in a reputation gain, without needing to actually give them the item.</p>
<p>The players posting to Reddit seem to be happy with the use of AI, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oz16tk/comment/npatqla/">one saying</a>, "THIS is how AI should be used in video games. Not to replace artists OR PROGRAMMERS but to have GOOD NPCS." Apparently replacing writers is just fine. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-future-where-you-and-this-bucket-that-fits-over-your-head-decide-what-a-game-meant-to-say-not-the-useless-idiots-that-made-it">says</a>, "The promised land of never having to experience a game the way it was intended again" is nearly here.</p>
<p>So as not to miss the naffness of this system, while some players are getting roughly in character responses about ketchup and flight plans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oymfma/teaching_liu_buzhu_some_modern_world_problems/">others are just being presented with rote information about the Godot game engine</a>. This isn't some exciting new frontier for NPC dialogue, it's just the same generic text that pours out of LLMs, it's just appearing in an unusual environment.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that, unlike Arc Raiders and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7, which at least have disclosures on their Steam pages, stating that generative AI was used in the games' development, there is nothing on Where Winds Meet's page revealing this egregious example.</p>
<p>AI tools are clearly not going away and will only become increasingly prevalent, but in Where Winds Meet, we have an example of the immediacy with which generative AI shits the bed when it comes into contact with players.</p>

            <p>
Is this what life is now? Witnessing massive, incredibly successful companies turning to AI to get advice on legal proceedings? You don't need to pinch me, I've already done it, and this world is real. The company in question here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton, who you might remember are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">being sued by three ex-leads of the game</a>; developer of the game Unknown Worlds are (technically) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">also suing this trio of developers in kind</a>. This all came about because Krafton delayed Subnautica 2, a decision that meant Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">wouldn't get a $250 million bonus</a>. And it seems that the publisher even asked ever-reliable ChatGPT for advice on how they could avoid doing just that.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a copy of a pre-trial briefing seen by <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">Kotaku</a> that was filed on behalf of those three ex-leads, Unknown founders Charles Cleveland, Adam "Max" McGuire, and Edward "Ted" Gill. The group's filing claims that "Krafton terminated the Founders and seized control of Unknown Worlds in order to avoid the earnout. Smoking gun documents show that Krafton was looking for ways to “cancel the earn-out” and that its secret 'Project X' was designed to either make a 'Deal' on the earnout or execute a 'Take over.' When the Founders would not agree to Krafton’s demands related to the earnout, Krafton decided a 'take over' would be the “easier” route."
</p>
<p>
A snippet of what appears to be a conversation between Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han and head of global operations Richard Yoon, with the latter making direct reference to enacting a take over. 
</p>
<p>
This filing also makes the claim that Krafton felt it had overpaid for Unknown Worlds, which led to them wanting to avoid the $250 million payout. So, to figure out a way to not do that, they seemingly turned to ChatGPT for help, with the filing explaining that "Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be ‘difficult to cancel the earn-out.'" The Unknown Worlds co-founders also say that Krafton wouldn't produce evidence of these ChatGPT conversations, and "when pressed, confirmed that they no longer exist."
</p><p>
I am not an expert in AI, even if I am a hater of it, but I feel that if I were in the same position as Krafton, as a massive publisher with some money to spare, and I really didn't want to give someone $250 million, I would not rely on a famously unreliable AI chatbot (I was being sarcastic earlier when I called it reliable, FYI). But that's just me!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm sure that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">voluntary redundancy program </a>Krafton have begun as part of a bid to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company">prioritise the use of generative AI in game development</a> is going to go really well for the industry.

            <p>I started a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl</a> run this past weekend, and like most of my decisions, I now look back on it with pain and regret. Had I waited just a couple more days, I could have begun anew with the roaming FPS's new Expedition update, which is out now and spans everything from difficulty modes and inventory tweaks to enemy behaviour reworks and yet more upgrades to its A-Life simulation system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Expedition, a.k.a. Update 1.7, is detailed in full over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993">Steam</a>. I consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a>’s Zone to be brutish enough that I likely won’t be braving its new Master difficulty, though the Expedition modifier – which can be applied on new games at lower difficulties – sounds interesting. It limits your saves and forces you to hang out with guitar-strumming fellow stalkers at camps in order to record your progress, a twist that brings back (mostly) fond memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>’s Hardcore mode. Though in a clear oversight, you can’t cover Stalker 2’s map in improvised bedrolls just to create a web of sleep-operated savepoints.</p> <figure>
<p>

<p>Meanwhile! GSC Game World, in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">ongoing quest</a> to build a society of persistently simulated gopniks, has refined how their A-Life system handles faction territories. The Zone’s various militias can now cede ground if they lose the wrong fights in the wrong places, and mutants – who have lairs of their own – will get involved in these border wars as well. Outdoor gunfights may also, to quote the patch notes, "feel fair at last", as baddies will no longer possess perfect sight through bushes, tall grass, and reeds. Sneakier Skifs can, thus, hide in the veg to evade or ambush passing goons – a marked development for Stalker 2’s otherwise limited stealth play.</p>
<p>Other highlights include an Immersion Mode that instantly switches off the HUD, a couple of new (if relatively non-murderous) anomalies to stumble into, and a light rejigging of the inventory screen that adds some extra detail to item stats and status effects. I also enjoy how knocking back energy drinks like an embittered Twitch streamer will now induce an aim-ruining tremor; perhaps it’s those health freaks at GSC Game World encouraging you to drink water instead. There’s a bunch of bug fixes and minor performance optimisations too.</p><p>I’d say there’s enough here to restart my restarted playthrough, thankfully <em>and</em> annoyingly, though in my heart of hearts I was never in the wait-for-updates camp to begin with. I found Stalker 2 an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">enthralling wandering sim</a> from the off, so thick with eerie, post-apocalyptic atmosphere that you could reach out and pull handfuls of radioactive muck from it. And that’s a hard thing to pull off, especially when your country is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">invaded by a dictatorial petrostate</a>, or someone is trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/misery-devs-claim-theyve-resolved-misunderstanding-with-stalker-studio-gsc-game-world-as-shooter-returns-to-steam">pinch your helicopter models</a>.</p>
