            <p>Yaaarrr. There be a fresh report about the long-rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake Ubisoft have still yet to publicly acknowledge. It claims the publisher are currently looking to release the retooled piracy game in early 2026, as well as providing more alleged details as to how the remake'll differ from the original.</p>
<p>This Black Flag remake's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years, with the voice actor of original protagonist Edward Kenway <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">alleging that he got in trouble</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">being recorded teasing it at a convention</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>Enter this video report from French publication Jeux VidÃ©o Magazine. They cite sources as having told them that Ubisoft are currently aiming to release the remake early next year, with March being the month it's most likely to make port. That said, Jeux VidÃ©o Magazine also cite some sources as having cast doubt over that and indicated it could be pushed towards the end of 2026, due to there allegedly being a lot of work left to do at this point.</p><p>The report also details a number of tweaks that developers Ubisoft Singapore, along with support studios Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are supposedly making to the original, mostly to bring Black Flag in line with the series' more recent entries. Parts of the present-day sections that saw you coming out of the Animus and wandering around the office of Abstergo Entertainment are reportedly being swapped out for more adventures set in the past, with cut content involving pirate Mary Read making up part of that.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too big a surprise, given the series has moved away from hefty present day elements of late, having adjusted to life without early protagonist Desmond Mason spearheading the non-past assassin/templar bickering. This year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features very little to take you out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">murdering your way through feudal Japan</a>, unless you're prepared to muck about in the Animus Hub menus or spend too long staring at a warning about fragmented memories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeux VidÃ©o Magazine report that the inventory and combat systems have been overhauled in a more RPG-style fashion that'll bring them closer to the likes of Shadows and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Valhalla</a>. Tech-wise, we can apparently expect improvements like load-screenless sailing, smaller islands being less barren, and the use of Shadows' engine making things look a bit less dated.</p>
<p>We reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and the publishers responded that they "havenâ€™t got anything to share" right now.</p>
<p>My feelings are a bit mixed at the moment as to whether this Black Flag remaster'll have much to offer over just firing up the original again for some very good piracy and assassining that's also there. Then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, a revamp which left me quite on the fence about its deliberately minimal tweakage outside of the obvious facelift, proved plenty popular earlier this year.</p>

            <p>What with all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">countersuits</a> between publishers Krafton and certain former Unknown Worlds executives, you could be forgiven for thinking that "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>" is some kind of arcane courtroom term - a compact way of saying "vicious haggling over withheld bonuses", perhaps. Here's a new developer diary video to remind us that Subnautica 2 is actually an underwater sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. It doesn't have any lawyers in it, but it does have a massive peckish tentacle monster. Set that one up for you, comments thread comedians!
</p><!--more-->
<p>Shared on <a href="https://press.krafton.com/UNKNOWN-WORLDS-REVEALS-THE-COLLECTOR-LEVIATHAN-IN-SUBNAUTICA-2">Krafton's press site</a>, the video introduces the Collector Leviathan, which appears to be a giant squid except it only has four tentacles/arms, not the regulation 10, unless you include all the tiny wiggly ones around its mouth.

<p>Given its embarrassing tentacle deficiency, it's no shock to read that the Collector Leviathan is an "irritable" creature. If it sees you, it will emit a noisy shockwave and jet towards you with body laid horizontal. Then, it will rear up vertical to give you a lovely look at its volcanic split cranium and painterly bioluminescent forehead patterns. Then it will grab you with a tentacle and eat you.</p><p>It's definitely better to be inside a submarine when this happens, but it's even better to not let it happen at all. Hide from the Collector, and it will eventually lose interest and glide away. You can also lure it off by throwing a flare.
</p>
<p>I dread meeting something this big in a real-world aquatic context, but I do like watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJtd9BLCuc">human divers encountering more reasonably sized cephalopods</a>. I hear that octopus arms contain <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/">"partly independent mini brains"</a>, and that they <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/how-octopuses-and-squids-change-color">both deceive predators and court mates</a> using colour changes.</p>
<p>Please put some of that in Subnautica 2, Unknown Worlds. I'd suggest letting players talk to the Collector Leviathan by means of chromophore mechanics, but that would risk aggravating both Edge Magazine and <a href="https://tomscullin.medium.com/the-limits-of-language-wittgensteins-lion-analogy-a2d4baa5bd20">Wittgenstein</a>, and I make it a rule never to piss both of them off at once. Also, now that I consider it, maybe don't give the Collector active camo - the prospect of it sneaking up on me through murky water is quite harrowing enough.
</p>
<p>The video is a tacit reminder from Krafton that there are still "veteran developers" at Unknown Worlds following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the sudden ejection of Subnautica 2 director Charlie Cleveland, studio CEO Ted Gill, and co-founder Max McGuire</a>. It's a 10 minute walkthrough of the Collector's creation that doubles as a dissection of the production itself - transporting us from concept sketches through modelling and animation to the creation of visual effects and AI behaviours.
</p><p>There's a teasing glimpse of a doc from September 2024, created by game designer Louis Karim, which rolls through how the Collector conveys its alertness through posture and sound. As regards some of the game's areas, at least, it will spawn at a distance from the player and despawn when you're sufficiently far away. It's a relief to learn that there's only one present per session, even during co-op. All this is WIP, mind.
</p>
<p>The doc also mentions a couple of in-game biomes, Sparse Plains and Outer Bounds, plus a blurred-out reference to another Leviathan. There's an untitled image of a third creature that looks like a piscine aeroplane. Apparently you will encounter the Collector in the course of "pearl interactions". Perhaps we'll have to crack open giant clam shells while avoiding the megasquid's attention.
</p>
<p>The September 2024 doc will likely be of interest to the Subnautical subredditors who are trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">gauge the completeness of Subnautica 2 from leaked materials</a>. The current pie-slinging match between Krafton's lawyers and those of the departed Unknown Worlds execs hinges on whether or not the game is fit for early access release this year. 
</p>
<p>Krafton claim it needs more time to cook, partly because the bygone Unknown Worlds bigwigs have been shirking their responsibilities, and are only interested in money. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire insist that the game was substantial enough for launch this year, and that Krafton only delayed it because they're welching on a timed $250 million earn-out. I am having more fun thinking about the tentacles.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> has launched its 1.0 version today, September 17th, ending the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">DRG</a> spinoffâ€™s two-year spell in early access.</p>
<p>Despite some initial umming and ahhing about how a comedy co-op FPS would translate into a single-player autoshooter â€“ if I press the Rock and Stone button and nobody hears, did I say Rock and Stone? â€“ DRG: Survivor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">quickly won me over</a>, thanks in particular to the tension and horde-dodging trickery afforded by its adaptation of the original gameâ€™s pickaxe mining. Iâ€™ve also had a little go on the 1.0 build ahead of release, and it does indeed feel like the most complete, well-tuned version yet.</p>

<p>The big additions are a new escort mission type, inspired by (yet sadly not also starring) Dotty the Drilldozer from OG Deep Rock, and the Gear system, which provides an alternative to the persistent upgrades shop by rewarding successful runs with equippable clobber. Your bearded exterminator can only don a handful of these at a time, but they grant juicier stat boosts than the upgrades that your cash and minerals will stretch to in the early game, so theyâ€™re good for a more tangible power boost.</p>
<p>Per-run, XP-earned weapon upgrades also seem slightly more generous than I remember from various early access builds, and the lower hazard levels (or difficulties, if youâ€™re a smooth-handed leaf lover) are generally more forgiving. That all gives DRG: Survivor a much more welcoming introductory phase, though there are also plenty of nasty mutators in the Anomaly Dives and Lethal Operations modes for danger seekers.</p><p>I, for one, am all about the power spikes, those cackling turnabouts where all your accumulated upgrades finally flick a brain switch from 'run away to survive' to 'run into them to kill.' I still think Vampire Survivors is more forthcoming with these moments, but DRG: Survivor 1.0 is at least more willing than previous versions to let you become a wave-wiping whirligig of bullets and plasma. Good on it.</p>

            <p>My liege, I bring more tidings from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and its Coronations DLC. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">apologising for the add-on "not being up to the standard you deserve"</a> last week, developers PDS Black have released a second patch aimed at smoothing out the edges of in-game oaths that've been causing issues.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">we reported</a> not long after Coronations arrived, it quickly turned into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">another instance</a> of Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">rather stepping in it</a> when it comes to DLC. Negative reception was fuelled both by technical issues with the new oaths rulers can take on ascending the throne, and the fact that the publishers were charging for features that are relatively compact, but also a pretty central aspect of any kingly lifespan.</p>

<p>To be fair to PDS Black, it's taken them less than a week to follow up on the promise of more Coronations fixes. Taking a look at the notes for the regal strategy game's freshly-released Update 1.17.1, there certainly isn't a shortage of tweaks, with a bit of balancing and a couple of new features to boot.</p>
<p>Those new additions are "a powerful new event for coronation hosts, allowing you to use your skilled chancellor to break up a neighboring confederation or earn a new vassal or tributary", plus some extra reasons for lovers to be in relationships. I assume the latter includes lines like 'his crown's got like seventy jewels, how sexy's that!' Meanwhile, balancing-wise, zealous characters are now easier to convert to witchcraft assuming their faith's OK with it. The Level six Millet Storage yurt also costs more to build, and "the â€˜Divine Marriageâ€™ tenet now has the incestuous trait as a virtue". Say what you want about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, its patch notes are rarely boring.</p>
<p>The rest of the bug fixes include, but aren't limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€˜Consolidate the empire/kingdomâ€™ oath: The requirement now fully checks for the title for which the coronation was held, not the current primary title.</li>
<li>â€˜Purge Pretendersâ€™ oath: Fixed the requirement for the children having a claim on your primary title.</li>
<li>â€˜Purge Pretendersâ€™ oath: Fixed decision display issues, fixed wrong law displayed in the selection tooltip.</li>
<li>â€˜Repentâ€™ oath: One pilgrimage is no longer counted as multiple</li>
<li>Removed the requirements for the oath buildings and replaced them with piety/prestige costs</li>
<li>Character Memories about Coronations are now more reliable</li>
<li>The event â€˜Fulfilled Oathâ€™ will no longer display "Consolidate the None" upon completing the Reconquer Oath</li>
<li>Forbid Pope and other Heads of Faith from bringing any demands in the â€˜Petitionersâ€™ event chain</li>
<li>Upon losing the last Kingdom title, all active oaths are removed, thus preventing a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>â€˜Install Claimantsâ€™ Oath: The decision now properly requires 3+ claimants installed via wars.</li>
<li>Building Oaths now better display the requirements for buildings in held baronies</li>
<li>â€˜Shape the Realmâ€™ Oath now has an updated building requirement in the decision window</li>
<li>â€˜Strengthen the Houseâ€™ Oath now is fully mechanically resolved upon completion</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/573767838266819604?l=english">the full notes here</a>, sire. This patch should hopefully stop you from instantly forgetting they exist or being distracted by some Popely demand.</p>
