            <p>"Bestest best?! We’ll have that!" is how I imagine detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">immersive sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-of-doubt">Shadows Of Doubt</a> made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. "RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">here</a>, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.</p>
<p>19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab’s Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a>.</p>

<p>The bundle itself is joining a bunch of other streaming events over December in raising money for eight charities. That’s War Child, CALM, Autistica, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Bristol Children’s Hospital, and Whale And Dolphin Conservation. You can find the details of each, including the stream times <a href="https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/">here</a>. If there’s a specific charity from the list you’re especially interested in supporting, different streams each have specific causes they’re fundraising for.</p><p>Of the games, I’m quite fond of both Two Point Campus and Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers. I suspect my actual favourite will turn out to be Citizen Sleeper - I’ve just been holding off on playing it for the right time. I like to meticulously block-in calender dates on which I expect to experience strong emotions, lest they interfere with my usual schedule of detached ennui.</p>
<p>My autocorrect won’t let me write ‘Brendy’ today without changing it to ‘Brandy’. Is this you trying to be Christmassy, Google docs? Please do not try and enforce your regime of cheer on me, it’s horrible. Anyway - Brendan’s favourite from the list would, I imagine, be Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-review">to which he awarded </a>a coveted and delicious RPS Bestest Best. “Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant,” wrote he. "I think the immersive detective sim has found its first true killer". Come for the thoughtful breakdown, stay for a detective named Dick McClumps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> arrives soon, which will be exciting to many of you who like the guy who runs from large boulders and occasionally cracks a whip. It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you've had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy's hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you'll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you'll need something even juicier.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've popped an image of the PC requirements below. Running the game at minimum specs (without ray tracing) isn't <em>too</em> costly to be fair. I'm no hardware editor, but I do think my own several-years-old PC could churn it out fairly comfortably, even if my slow broadband speeds would take about a year to download the hefty 120GB needed before I could even get started. If you're after ray tracing at minimum, you'll need a RTX 4070 12GB. One thing I do know - that 4070 ain't cheap, chief.</p>

<p>As for those recommended specs (again, without ray tracing), you're looking at a pretty pricey system, firmly planted within that midrange tier. The work-supplied PC I'm writing this article on can run most games smoothly at 1080p, but if I wanted to get into Indy on the recc specs, I'd need to double my RAM. If I wanted to even tickle Ultra settings? Hah. No.</p>

<p>Our Edwin had a go of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones">Indiana Jones</a> And The Meatball Marinara a little while ago and found it to be "handsome and glossy enough" in presentation, but with a world that felt like "the usual triple-A compromise of impossible sheen at the price of a certain liveliness". Not to mention Indy's insatiable desire to get his grubby hands on everything. Make sure to give Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">preview</a> a read for his full thoughts on it all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
