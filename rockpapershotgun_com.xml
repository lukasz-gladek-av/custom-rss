            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> just held its 2026 summit this week, and with it came a bevy of details about future updates and plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. Oh what joy for you scaper or runes! The main thing that got a look-in was the game's next big update, Dowdun Reach: Madness of Zamorak, which certainly has an air of someone looking at any section of a given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and thinking "yeah, I want a fortress like that."
</p>
<p>
This update comes following some feedback the devs received over a desire to see more locales with interiors and buildings to fight through and explore, hence the castle keepy nature of this update. There's a bunch of big scary knights to fend off, and in March more details will be shared regarding the kind of loot you'll be able to pick up ahead of its release at the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
What's perhaps a touch funny about this update is that the level cap for all skills will be raised to 99, "even though the skills aren't finished yet." Perhaps an odd choice, but one that's again based on some feedback of folks "wanting to grind out levels and not waste XP." So, if you're someone that likes the grind, technically for now you'll be wasting your time, but any level-locked bits will be automatically available to you as they get added in.
</p>
<p>
After this big update, the next big one is Umbral Sands: Fire of Fuzan, planned for release this summer, which brings you to a deserty area where during the day the sun will be your biggest enemy, requiring you to find shade or build shelter to avoid its rays. There's also a big ole dragon called Fuzan you have to be cautious of, because, well, this game is called Dragonwilds after all.
</p><p>
And lastly, there's Scorned Wilderness: Rage of Kuldra, which is currently planned for launch this autumn. Details are slim on this one, but a <a href="https://dragonwilds.runescape.com/">blog post</a> does have this to say: "What we can tell you is this: Kuldra must die. Face off against the God-Eater and bring down their tyrannical reign as you muster your allies, drive into the wilderness to acquire Rune Armour and delve into the heart of the Anima storm." Why does it always have to be the God-Eater? Can't it be something nicer, less fire-breathy for once?

            <p>
I'm sure there's been many a Dweet and forum post about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is already a dead game or some such silly thing to say about a game that's not even a week old, but it does at least seem like developer Wildlight is paying attention to some of the more constructive bits of criticism about the game. Namely, that many aren't fond of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> 3v3 Raids simply because it feels like there aren't enough people for such large maps. So in turn, there's already an update adding in an experimental new raid mode.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply, as opposed to 3v3 the headcount is upped to 5v5. "We heard the feedback!" reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/538877446766724427">Steam blog post</a>. "For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!" A couple of tweaks have also been made to account for the added numbers, the first being that raids are now 10 lives instead of six, and respawns take a bit longer during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused."
</p>
<p>
With this update also comes a new base called the Soul Well, a "dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak." You should notice some small improvements here and there, for things like animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and "other gameplay systems." On top of all that, you can also turn motion blur on or off now.
</p>
<p>
None of this sounds particularly massive on the offset, but for a game like 5v5 does sound like it should liven things up a bit. We'll just have to wait and see what the results are after this weekend!
