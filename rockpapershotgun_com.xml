            <p>
Last year, after a bit of a wait, Silent Hill was released, and with it came some changes to the series. The combat was a lot more actiony, the format for multiple endings was drastically different, but the most obvious change was its setting. We're not in Silent Hill anymore, Toto! We're in Ebisugaoka, Japan, also a fictional town, though clearly not a fictional country. And that's because Silent Hill, the place, is now also Silent Hill, the "phenomenon."
</p>
<p>
Writer of the game Ryukishi07 recently shared in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/53254">Famitsu</a> (ta for the translations, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-is-not-just-the-name-of-a-place-it-is-a-phenomenon-silent-hill-f-writer-doubles-down-on-theory-from-a-short-message-that-had-the-fanbase-divided/">GamesRadar</a>) that he felt unsure of why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> would be set in Japan. "I discussed a lot of things with series producer [Motoi] Okamoto in a meeting after I received the request [to write Silent Hill f,]" Ryukishi07 shared. 
</p>
<p>
"Like 'Why is it set in Japan?' and 'What exactly is Silent Hill?'" But it was while speaking with Okamoto that the pair "came to the conclusion that Silent Hill is not just the name of a place, it is a phenomenon. Looking back I think I was able to create a pretty satisfying base for the story and world from this."
</p>
<p>
You might remember that such a thing was even referenced in The Short Message, which quite literally makes mention of a "Silent Hill phenomenon." I'm certainly not opposed to the series taking a more anthological approach, I even think that's what it should be doing. But I have to say that putting a name to it feels a bit too much like showing your hand. Revel in the mystery, in the unknown, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>! It's more fun that way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, weirdly revealing choice or not, I do actually think Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">quite good</a>, and worth a pop yourself if you haven't given it a chance already.
