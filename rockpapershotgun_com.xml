            <p>It is time once again to shake our fists at the sky over the untimely, messy splintering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> as a cultural phenomenon. Yesterday, Youtuber Jamrock Hobo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dde8H1YhP-U">leaked a presentation</a> for Locust City - An Elysium Story, an abandoned project that would have expanded the original RPG's detective odd-couple premise by having you control two returning characters simultaneously, each with their own furiously personified skill tree and Thought Cabinet of percolating ideas. </p>
<p>Cancelled in February and hitherto known as Project X7, Locust City was to star Cuno and Cunoesse, a pair of foul-mouthed kids from the streets of Revachol. I spent minimal time with the pair when I reviewed Disco Elysium, because they are vicious brats, but like every character in the game, they have many facets - it's possible to get on Cuno's good side and even recruit him as an ally. As such, I'm intrigued to see how his and Cunoesse's story might have proceeded in Locust City, and sad that I will almost certainly never get to play the game.</p>
<p>Locust City was seemingly called Locust City because one of Cuno's treasured in-game possessions was to be a locust city in a cardboard box. According to the leaked presentation - which dates back to around nine months before the cancellation, and features commentary from now-departed ZA/UM writer Dora Klindžić - the box was to serve as an evolving allegory for his emotions and values. It was also something of a town management subgame: Cuno could put stuff in the locust box to create buildings and facilities, altering the chemistry of his insect world, and potentially fomenting civil wars.</p>
<p>The game outside the box is described as a "single player cooperative" experience. You'd have controlled Cuno and Cunoesse simultaneously, picking one as leader during exploration, terrain interaction and dialogue, and swapping between them to make use of their different capacities. Each character was to receive their own Thought Cabinet, with familiar unlocks such as Mazovian Socio-Economics, and set of RPG skills, including old Disco Elysium standbys like Half Light and Electro-Chemistry. As with Disco Elysium, these skills would have been presences in dialogue, and each character would have had their own voiced narrator - there's a sample of the voice-acting at the end of the video.</p>
<p>The pair would also have picked up on different aspects of their surroundings, extending into the audio design - the presentation gives the example of Cuno overhearing the turning of a book page, while Cunoesse is preoccupied with the gushing of a fountain. As for how you might use their skills in tandem, they would have shared an inventory and been able to combine skills for certain skill checks, but the more fascinating dynamic is that they would have developed their intellectual lives in response to each other. The presentation broaches the prospect of "chain thoughts" about specific topics, triggering further interactions and affecting their overall relationship.</p>
<p>I'm likely falling into the trap of having only glowing things to say of a game I'll never get to analyse, but it sounds like a terrific elaboration of Disco. It takes H.D.B's multitude of garrulous self-manifestations and stretches them precariously between two skulls. I'm also interested to experience the not-unhopeful, post-revolutionary dystopia of Revachol through the eyes of lost children, rather than a perma-hungover amnesiac.</p>
<p>It's possible some of the thinking here lives on at the three "Disco Elysium successor" studios formed in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">acrimonious ZA/UM firings and subsequent legal action</a> - that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Dark Math Games</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">Longdue</a> and especially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">Summer Eternal</a>, who appear to have the most former Disco Elysium developers (including Klindžić) on their books and appear closest in their values to the original development team.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A video game union representing around 300 workers at Elder Scrolls, Doom and Fallout publisher ZeniMax Media have overwhelmingly voted for strike action if they’re unable to thrash out a deal over wages and workplace conditions with Microsoft, ZeniMax’s parent company. The unionised workers and Microsoft have been haggling over things like remote work options and outsourcing game testing for nearly two years; now, they say they’re prepared to down tools if their concerns aren’t addressed.</p>
<p>QA workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">founded ZeniMax Workers United in December 2023</a>, as part of the umbrella organisation of the Communication Workers Of America (CWA) union. Microsoft acknowledged the union at the time, but as Brendy pointed out in a previous write-up, this likely isn’t an indication of union sympathies among the leadership. Microsoft had previously signed a “neutrality” deal with the CWA in order to grease the wheels of their Activision-Blizzard acquisition, allowing workers to "freely and fairly make a choice about union representation”.</p>
<p>Last year, the ZWU participated in a one-day strike claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over their return to office policies and outsourcing practices. According to a statement released yesterday, their members “are continuing to take a stand at the table over better wages, workplace improvements, and key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company’s replacement of in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union.” They’ve now voted by more than 94% to approve their leaders to kick off a strike if Microsoft don’t give them a contract addressing these things.</p>
<p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong comments in the statement. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.”</p>
<p>Associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield adds: “Despite being one of the world’s largest corporations, we’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we’re asking for too much. Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of union action at Microsoft-owned companies lately. 241 Bethesda Game Studios workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">started a CWA-affiliated union</a> of their own last summer. 461 ZeniMax Online Studios staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">followed suit in December</a>. Pay and working conditions aside, many of these workers are worried about job security and the effects of generative AI tools upon their livelihoods. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">have sunk billions into genAI development</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">laying off thousands of people</a> in the course of their Activision-Blizzard acquisition.</p>
<p>Nic has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">taking the lead</a> on our union reporting. Here’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">his piece</a> on the recent announcement of an “industry-wide union” by the CWA, which aims “to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, but also to build large-scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The makers of cardy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> announced a release date yesterday, revealing that it'll be pulling into Steam libraries and honking its big "all aboard" horn in less than two months. Do you have the capacity to allow another deckbuilder into the overcrowded dining car of your brain? I probably don't. But I do have fond memories of the first game's crunchy runs and over-the-top card combos. Hmmm, maybe another rail trip or two hundred <em>would</em> be nice. </p>

<p>The release date is May 21st, said developers Shiny Shoe in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1102190/view/502820742193219263">a Steam post</a>. They shared the news on April 1st, and so felt the need to clarify that this was an actual factual release date announcement - not a silly April Fools jest. They opted for a straightforward announcement because they didn't want to do "a disservice to the entire dating sim genre" by revealing a shallow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> dating sim spinoff called "You Stole My Pyre Heart".</p>
<p>"This does not exist," they say, "please do not ask for it. We’re giving you Monster Train 2. Please."</p>
<p>The sequel will involve a similar violent train ride as the first game, in which you essentially play three or four games of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at once. But whereas you previously fought as the demons of hell against the angels of heaven, this time you'll combine the warring forces to battle a new enemy - the ancient Titans. </p>
<p>It's set to include "five all-new clans, dozens of new cards, and surprises of all shapes and sizes". This includes "Room" cards which will have some effect on the space you're fighting within. You'll also be able to get "new parts for your train and customize it to suit your personal style". A fashionable new cow catcher perhaps?</p>
<p>The first Monster Train was a maximalist numberwang of flashing delights, according to Matt (RPS in peace), who said it was "at least as good as Slay The Spire." Here's a snippet of thoughts I enjoy from his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">Monster Train review</a>. </p>
<blockquote>I'm not comfortable saying it's outright better. Not yet, at least, but I will say this: before Monster Train came along I couldn't see myself ever obsessing over a deckbuilder in the same way that I did with the Spire. It seemed too immaculate to meaningfully improve on, but there are plenty of specific ways in which the Train does exactly that.</blockquote>
<p>Good thing you can play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-2-revealed-for-2025-release-and-you-can-play-the-demo-right-now">a demo of the upcoming sequel</a> already, if you, like Matt and I, are inclined to monstering with numbers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
