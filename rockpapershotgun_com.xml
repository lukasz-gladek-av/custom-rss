To be a person that looks forward to video games and DLC for video games is to also be a person that must do so knowing that, at this point in time, they are likely to be delayed. It is what it is! Perhaps the dismantling of our current economic system and rebuilding one that doesn't put profits first would mean developers could take their time, but that'll probably also take a while. As a result, we're in a situation where, earlier today, developer TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord's</a> first bit of DLC, War Sails, has been delayed.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"After taking a hard look at where things stand, it became clear we won’t be ready by the originally planned release date of June 17th," TaleWorlds explained in a <a href="https://www.taleworlds.com/en/News/574">post</a> on their website. Now, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game is currently slated for a slightly less specific fall/ autumn release window later this year
</p>
<p>
Further explaining the delay TaleWorlds wrote that they came to this decision because they "need more time to reach the level of quality you rightfully expect. The extra development period will give us more time to apply additional polish, and continue making progress on the improvements to the base game that are already in motion." A new release date should be on the way in "upcoming weeks" at least.
</p>
<p>
War Sails, if you could tell by the name, is all about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlords-first-bit-of-dlc-is-all-about-taking-the-lads-out-on-a-not-so-nice-boat-trip">going out on a lovely little sailing trip</a>. Well, maybe not lovely, it's more about doing trade or fighting enemies, but you get what I mean. You'll be able to board enemy ships while out on the open sea, and a Viking-inspired faction is being introduced with this expansion too. All of it sounds pretty good, you just won't be playing it next month.

"BEING A TEENAGER SUCKS. So we made a videogame about it." These are the opening words on the Steam page for Jenny Jiao Hsia's Consume Me, a "life-simulation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" about feeling "stupid, fat, lazy, and ugly in high school." Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and say many of you that are of a post-high-school age probably don't want to re-experience it anytime soon, but Consume Me looks like such a good time I'm going to suggest you do so anyway, especially because it just got a demo.
</p>

<p>
That self-described genre of life-simulation RPG certainly seems apt as the game sees you do things like performing Tetris-esque puzzles to make a well-balanced breakfast, putting make-up on, and walking your dog. It almost looks like an RPG by way of the mundane sections in any of the modern Persona games, said mundanity amped up and sillified to 11.

<p>
Rather than an RPG mechanically though, there's two things it reminds me of first and foremost. One is the WarioWare series, there's a real oddball minigame feel to a lot of what Consume Me appears to offer, even if it's a bit occasionally a bit slower paced than what the greedy yellow-capped… Wario is. It also reminds me of old Flash games - think Newgrounds, Miniclip, Nitrome, that sort of thing, the kinds of games you'd play during IT classes when you were meant to be putting an Excel sheet about the price of eggs together.
</p>
<p>
I'd actually seen a much, much earlier version of the game at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overthinking-games-the-achievable-goals-of-wobble-yoga">the V&amp;A's Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition</a> way back in, cripes, 2019, and was enamoured by it then. It's great to see how far it's come - it even won the IGF Grand-Prize earlier this year! No release date for this one just yet, but you can go ahead and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">wishlist it on Steam and check out that demo anyway</a>.

What do you think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islands-and-trains">Islands &amp; Trains</a> is about? I'm not going to give you long, because it really is just right there in the name. As you've presumably already guessed, it is a quaint-looking sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> where you make tiny diorama-like islands, adorning them with tracks for trains to choo-choo along. I told you, it's a name that does what it says on the tin, and if it appeals to you at all, well, there's some good news, as it just came out today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Islands &amp; Trains for the most part looks like one of those kind of build-your-own screensaver type of games, without the screen saving part. Developer Akos Makovics specifically cited games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> as influences, all titles with a focus on making peaceful places to look at with a hopeful sense of ease. So, if they're up your alley, this one probably will be too.

There's apparently over 400 types of tiles to play around with, lots of variations amongst those too, and you'll notice animals like cows and ducks flocking in as you build up your city. I'm not typically a sandbox builder kind of person myself, and yet looking at it I can't help but harken back to my own childhood playing with my dad's model railway. 
</p>
<p>
He wasn't the kind of model train enthusiast that had all the extremities like sets and tiny trees, so imagination was key to building up a picture. Islands &amp; Trains looks like a nice opportunity to express that childlike sense of train-oriented curiosity. You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/">Steam</a> right now if it takes your fancy.
