            <p>Have you ever wanted to swim out of a spaceship's backside while it sits in orbit, the sound of two dear friends arguing over whether it really needs a fifth teleporter room not seeping with you into the inky blackness? You know, because space is a famously scream-free zone. Well, the latest in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s endless string of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-latest-big-update-that-is-somehow-also-free-will-let-you-become-a-mayor-of-all-things">free</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-has-a-mass-effect-normandy-again-together-with-new-cross-save-functionality">updates</a> has you covered. It's called Voyagers, and adds in custom multi-person ships dubbed corvettes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These ships are yours to design and build to your liking, with the addition of some sleeping quarters and a mission radar all you need to get started and welcome a crew of friends aboard to accompany you on your adventures. "These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters," said Hello Games boss Sean Murray. "It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</p>
<p>Murray adds that corvettes, which you can naturally also tape the likes of extra guns and windows to, are "encountered a little way into the game" and can be unlocked "reasonably swiftly" by spacers who've already sunk plenty of hours into the quest for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">spacevival</a>. The Voyagers update relies on tech which Hello say has been developed with an eye to their next game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-no-fire">Light No Fire</a>, which as an open-world thing on an Earth-sized planet with Earth-sized oceans, will feature large boats and crews of its own.</p>

<p>Naturally, that's no easy feat, with Murray revealing: "Almost every part of the game has had to be reworked to accommodate these relative spaces. Having your multiplayer crew walking around, calmly editing your ship, as it travels at warp speeds towards a planet that is being generated as you approach. It's pretty insane what's going on behind the scenes to make that work."</p><p>Cool, but also, I'm looking at this very being-in-a-ship-centric update and can't help being drawn to an aspect of it that doesn't technically involve being in a ship. You see, if you park multiple corvettes in orbit around a planet, you can spacewalk or skydive between them. In practice, your space-suited little fella's gently spat out of the back entrance to your craft, like... Well, I'll refrain from describing it in the manner I'd typically employ, since the RPS treehouse has a bit more decorum than some of the other places I've hung out. Suffice it to say that mucking about pinging between ships and diving down towards the surface looks like great fun.</p>
