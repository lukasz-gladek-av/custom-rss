            <p>The developers of workplace comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> and anti-establishment roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reignbreaker">Reignbreaker</a> are closing down, and the news comes just two weeks before their final punky action game is due to come out. Studio Fizbin has been struck by ongoing cuts at their parent company Thunderful, they say, and despite pitching follow-up projects to work on after Reignbreaker's release, none of those will go ahead. Which means they'll be winding down at the exact moment you'd hope they'd be celebrating a payoff from years of work. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024, which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report, also affected Studio Fizbin," said founder Alexander Pieper in a statement <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick">on the studio's website</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release">Gamedeveloper</a>. "Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing Reignbreaker. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>"This means that Reignbreaker will be Studio Fizbin’s final game."</p>
<p>Publishers Thunderful recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">slashed 80-100 jobs across their studios</a>, and said they'll now focus on publishing games by outside studios, rather than developing their own. It looks like the full effects of that decision are now being felt. </p>
<p>If you haven't seen it yet, Reignbreaker is a very purple and black action roguelike about bringing down a tyrannical queen with plenty of spear chuckin' and upgrade choosin'. When James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reignbreaker-is-an-anti-establishment-roguelike-thats-clearly-pro-hades">played its monarch-toppling chaingunnery</a> he noted "flashy isometric fights" and "pausing for a chat with some charismatic, lovingly hand-drawn, likely flirty side character." Sound familiar? James thought so too. "It’s so very, very Hades," he said. </p>
<p>As for the theme, it's a response to the "rise in right-wing authoritarianism all around the world, the growing class divide and exploitation", according to community manager Ian Stewart. If any of that sounds intriguing, you can play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">demo on Steam</a> yourself. The game is due to release on March 18th.</p>
<p>Before this Studio Fizbin made a bunch of games that have been well-liked by RPS staff, such as point and click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-inner-world">The Inner World</a>, hand-drawn puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minute-of-islands">Minute Of Islands</a>, and the comedy anti-capitalist refuse 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/say-no-more">Say No! More</a> which Alice B (RPS in peace) called "short but immensely satisfying". Here's a snippet of her thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>It casts universal capitulation as a global, systemic problem, and, at the same time, being realistic and setting boundaries as a path to everyone being healthy and happy. But not in a preachy way. In an absurd way.</blockquote>
<p>Fizbin will spend their remaining time as a studio working to ship the game, says Pieper, as well as providing some post-launch support to Reignbreaker, and supporting workers in finding new work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-heres-a-monster-hunter-wilds-mod-to-make-your-palico-very-large<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There comes a time in every cat owner's life where they must ask themselves: how large would this creature need to be before it attempted to bat me around like a catnip mouse? I suspect the answer is "only as large as it needed to be", so it's fortunate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' Palicoes are apparently bred for helpfulness. Is installing a mod to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> that makes them tall as humans a form of gene splicing? Don't worry, hunter. Gene splicing is how nature heals itself.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/35">The mod is called 'Kitty Big'. </a>There isn't much to say about it beyond that. You don't need to continue reading now, so here's a little story for anyone left.</p>
<p>Once, a peaceful and prosperous hamlet was terrorised by a beast that demanded regular sacrifices, lest it drag its lumpen form down from its mountain dwelling and drain the lifeblood from the villagers.</p>
<p>Not just any sacrifice would appease its capricious tastes, however. Some days, it demanded the flesh of storied warriors. Others, humble farm hands. Occasionally, it wanted those little cocktail sticks with pineapple and cheese on, which was bollocks because where do you even find pineapples in this climate?</p>
<p>One day, the people of the hamlet decided they'd had enough of catering to the beast's whims, especially since the one thing the creature was useful for - dispersing snippets of wisdom in response to specific queries and occasionally reverse image searching a nice shirt you didn't know where to buy - had recently been borked by a colony of parasites taken up residence in the monster's brain stem. So they refused to make any more sacrifices. And they all got eaten.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that sometimes you just have to give Google what it wants. Today, that's the words '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' followed by whatever mildly interesting nugget of disposable information I can dig up between my first and second morning coffee. Nice mod, though. I'll probably use it once I buy the game, which won't be until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">they've sorted out the performance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
