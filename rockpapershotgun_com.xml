            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shogun-total-war">Shogun: Total War</a> is 25 years old this year, and Creative Assembly are holding <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/73">a multi-month long celebration</a> kicking off in August with livestreams, interviews, sales, and multiplayer tournaments, all culminating with a showcase in early December. This will be the first showcase of its type they've done, and it's billed to feature announcements for "new games" in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. That's more than one, as the discerning pluralisation understanders among you have no doubt sagely clocked.</p>

<p>"Whether youâ€™re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy," writes CA's Roger Collum. "Warhammer 40K and Medieval 3!" The crowds bay in frothing anticipation. "Star Wars and World War 1!", we scream like shrill goats perched on single planks of driftwood floating upon stone-gray oceans, kept from madness only by the knowledge that we can adequately explain what a hammer and anvil maneuver is, in lieu of having formed any meaningful human relationships in a decade.</p>
<p>"Lord Of The Rings and Empire 2!", reads the scrawled note sellotaped to the goat-rescuing submariner's periscope lens, resulting in the tragic water deaths of both the goat and then the entire crew somehow. This madness has gone too far. Please, control yourselves.</p>
<p>For what it's worth: yes, I think at least one of these games is going to be Warhammer 40,000. On to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">hefty pile of circumstantial evidence</a>, you can add the seeming absence of Warhammer 3 game director Rich Aldridge from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">latest Tides Of Torment showcase</a>. This said, it's also equally possible Aldridge is hard at work on the massive End Times expansion I'm sure is coming to Twarhammer sooner rather than later. "Tides of Torment DLC will reveal its final playable faction in July," writes Collum, "and some long-awaited content will be unveiled at the anniversary showcase". As long as I get Thanquol before the trilogy wraps up, I'm a happy little ratman. Well, Thanquol <a href="https://youtu.be/iUwsmt4DlUM">and Toddy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Such has been the onslaught of livestreams, showcases, reveals, re-reveals, trailers and assorted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Keighleybollocks</a> this month that we skipped the new game round-up last week. The Maw, thankfully, was too stuffed with Capcom previews to express much discontent, but it could have been disastrous. The last time we forgot to lay out a Monday feeding schedule, the creature ate a bunch of double-A publishers. What, you didn't seriously think THQ went under due to "strong headwinds", did you? But enough lamentation - there are new PC games to discuss.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are you old enough to remember GEX? My sympathies. There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gex-trilogy">GEX trilogy</a> remaster out today. If you are not old enough to remember GEX, perhaps you will be more enraptured by cute co-op climbing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>. I also have my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">Nightmare Frontier</a>, a sort of weird western XCOM, with the caveat that AI generation tools were used to created some of its menu assets and translate the script.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's time to date everything in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Date Everything!</a> and take back Control of the office in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC Firebreak</a>. There's also post-apocalyptic colony builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, elven real-time tactics game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wartorn">Wartorn</a>, and shonen mech RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525510/NITRO_GEN_OMEGA/">Nitro Gen Omega</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>In first-person actioner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blessed-burden">Blessed Burden</a> you are the last surviving priest journeying deep into the bowels of hell, or thereabouts. In deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/">Crown Gambit</a> you are a team of paladins trying to save a city from political turmoil, and "unearthly beasts".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/">Broken Arrow</a> is not a 90s airplane movie but a real-time strategy game set in the Baltic states with over 300 units. Pretty much the polar opposite of pixelart escapade <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425180/Vessels_of_Decay/">Vessels Of Decay</a>, in which you navigate a post-apocalyptic Scandinavia full of folkoric monsters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can think of no better way to spend Friday than by tending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mushroom-musume">an eerie mushroom princess</a>. Unless it be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">sabotaging gravity as a witch</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the treehouse up to this week? Brendan and Jeremy are deep in the desert, Nic is roving an open world with a block of tofu, James appears moderately excited about a TV of some kind, Mark is reopening the gates of Oblivion, Graham is sitting on a large throne made of bones, and Ollie continues to reign over the night. How about you?</p>
