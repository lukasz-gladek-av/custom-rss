            <p>Naughty Dog have announced their long-gestating new game, and their first in a long while that's not a sequel. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is a science fiction bounty hunter game set on a mysterious isolated planet, and the first cinematic trailer is below.

<p>"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," explains <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement">a Naughty Dog blog post</a>. "In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit."
</p>
<p>Intergalactic has apparently been in development since 2020 and has a soundtrack by Atticus Ross. Otherwise, Naughty Dog are keeping a lot about the game secret for now, only say that they're aiming to make "an emotional, character-driven epic journey" with the "deepest gameplay" of any of their games so far. Maybe that means it's set in a hole.
</p><p>I like the appearance of recognisable brands in the trailer above - Porsche, Adidas, Sony of course. I imagine that can't continue once you touchdown on a strange, remote planet, but it never fails to tickle me when Person Be In Future, but Future Person Knows Things I Know. I'm a simple animal.
</p>
<p>I like less, of course, that this is currently only coming to PlayStation 5. I think it's a safe bet that we'll get it on PC eventually, but there's no guarantee as to when.

            <p>I'm a big fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>, which pit Sonic and pals against a stable of characters from Sega's other games, including Total War and Football Manager. I'm less of a fan of Sonic's other kart racing exploits, but I'm still cautiously interested to learn he's getting back behind the wheel. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was just announced.

<p>Well, that's brief. And doesn't show Sonic - it's current favourite Shadow that's getting behind the wheel in the short teaser trailer above. Apparently we'll learn more about the game in 2025.
</p>
<p>Perhaps that will include who is making it. There's no developer logo on the trailer above bar Sega themselves. The most recent game in the series, 2019's Team Sonic Racing, and its predecessor Racing Transformed, were both the work of Sumo Digital - although it's been a long time and the more recent wasn't well received, so I doubt it's the same folks doing it this time.
</p>
<p>In any case, the idea suggested by the title "CrossWorlds" gives me hope I'll be able to race against that weird headless Football Manager Man again.</p>
