            <p>I liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and having read through the notes for its summer update, patch 1.5, I reckon I'll like it even more whenever I next decide to don <a href="https://www.vg247.com/becoming-avoweds-most-toxic-360-no-scoper">the persona of a trickshotting Envoy</a>.</p>
<p>This patch is the <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945182871930511524">second of three seasonal updates</a> Obsidian outlined that the game'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">over the course of this year</a>. It's brought a substantial rework of fighter and ranger skills, some extra unique weapons for you to get your mitts on, Steam Deck verification, plus a bunch of other tweaks and fixes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The changes to abilities on offer to non-magical scrappers form the meat of <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/">the patch's notes</a>, and Obsidian say they've been made "to round out the classes compared to the Wizard tree". Those damn wizards, always getting the fancy tricks.
</p>
<p>The new abilities added in include the likes of a Shadow Step skill for sneaky stealthers that'll let you casually "step into the Beyond, reappearing behind your enemy", with upgrades offering the chance to do stuff like ensure these killer backstabs reset the ability's cooldown.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update 1.5 is now live for Avowed! Please update your game when you see that this update is available to receive the following features, fixes, and changes: <a href="https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r">https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r</a></p><p>• Explore new weapons, abilities, and armor<br>• Korean and Japanese language support<br>• ✔️ Steam… <a href="https://t.co/6VEIccb1Ir">pic.twitter.com/6VEIccb1Ir</a></p></div>— Avowed (@AvowedtheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945181691800076625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Melee Maurices, on the other hand, get skills like reviving allies "from a great distance", a Barbaric Smash that lets you absorb an enemy's built up stun reserves if your "massive blow" kills them, and the ability to take a deep breath that immediately recovers all of their stamina. That last one's something I need in real life.</p>
<p>Alongside that, Obsidian have aimed to address folks "not able to play specific builds that they wanted to early on in the game" by littering a bunch of extra unique weapons throughout Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, Shatterscarp, and Galawain’s Tusks. The former two have gotten the most, with six and five items respectively, mirroring the goal to frontload some more fun.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enemies have been given some player abilities "such as Returning Storm, Ring of Tire, Taunt, Clear Out, Blizzard, and Tanglefoot" as well as new physical and magical barriers to block attack. So they should be equipped to try and hold off your newfound skillage.</p>
<p>Add in the Steam Deck verification, some changes to the cooking and crafting interface, and a bunch of bug fixes. The result's a patch that looks to me like a decent excuse to dust off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-beginners-guide">your facial shrooms</a> if you fancy a fresh playthrough, even if it's unlikely to turn your view on Avowed around if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">the release version</a> wasn't up your alley.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun]]></content:encoded>

The dark fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be £33.50, and it's Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games handling the adaption. I had a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frosthaven-is-getting-a-digital-follow-up-to-gloomhaven-and-you-can-play-it-this-month">short hands-on preview</a> with the director back in March. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the series, Frosthaven and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a> (which has been treated to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">excellent digital adaption</a>) are some of the most elephantine and absurdly lavish of the big box 'legacy' board games. The idea behind a legacy game is, instead of whipping it out for the odd isolated session, you play a full campaign. There's character progression with little bags to store your stuff in, stickers to put on the map to mark new locations you've discovered, and mystery boxes to be opened when the game tells you to. It feels like pure magic when pulled off by a board game, but you naturally lose some of that when everything's being done digitally. What's impressive with cards, tokens and stickers just becomes rote when performed by a computer.</p>
<p>Luckily, Gloomhaven and Frosthaven have clever and deep tactical combat that's worth engaging with for its own sake, alongside story events with choice and consequence. I haven't played the physical version of Frosthaven, but Gloomhaven was a biblical bollockcrusade to set up and tear down. I cannot promise you the PC version of Frosthaven will be good but, as with the Gloomhaven adaption, I can confidently say it will never require you to glue together an MDF token tray.</p>
<p>Where Frosthaven most differs from its prequel is in the town itself, where you'll construct and upgrade buildings to unlock more equipment and events. Some features from Steam, a digital storefront and therefore immune to the psychic damage caused by the following irresponsible abundance of capital letters:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>UNIQUE CHARACTERS</strong> - Choose from six starting character classes—including the Banner Spear, Boneshaper, Drifter, Geminate, Blinkblade, and Deathwalker</li>
<li>Additional classes will be unlocked as you progress your campaign</li>
<li>Each class features its own unique abilities and playstyle to master</li>
<li><strong>DEEP, TACTICAL COMBAT</strong> - Engage in deep, tactical turn-based combat, testing your skills against an array of new enemies and formidable bosses</li>
<li>Utilize an ability card system that requires careful planning to unleash devastating attacks, execute powerful combos, and try keeping your party members alive</li>
<li><strong>BUILD YOUR OUTPOST -</strong> Manage the Outpost, constructing and upgrading various buildings, unlocking new game features and mechanics</li>
<li><strong>A STUNNING WORLD TO EXPLORE</strong> – A stunning art style, highly detailed models and textures, and expressive animations all bring the world of Frosthaven to life.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>There's 130 quests in the full thing, and I'm assuming quests here means a full location with enemies, an objective, and likely a story event or two. There'll be "35+ quests across Acts 1 and 2" in the early access build at launch. You can also play with up to three mates. Another reason you might be interested in Frosthaven is if you're weary of 'brutish' fantasy races - Cephalofair hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">good orc opinion haver</a> James Mendez Hodes to help build on Frosthaven's world, and what I've seen seems much richer for it. His writings have been over-simplified over the years in some well-meaning but ultimately clumsy "orcs are black people" cultural criticisms, but it's <a href="https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror">great work</a> from a great writer who, like me, just bloody loves a good orc.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-fantasy-frosthaven-is-a-dm-free-dungeons-and-dragons-campaign-in-a-box-and-its-coming-to-steam-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We are straining Rock Paper Shotgun's innovative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-the-demo-for-this-magical-scandinavian-skiing-game-is-so-serene-then-why-do-i-die-constantly">"News To Me, Anyway"</a> subcategory to breaking point with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxic-depths-caves-of-the-yendori">Anoxic Depths: Caves Of The Yendori</a>, a turn-based spelunking roguelite from Studio Tectorum. The scurvy bean-counters among you might protest that it came out 10 years ago, possibly before some of you were old enough to read, operate video games, or count beans. To you scurvy bean-counters I would say: if you're going to be so picky about details, how about you help me remember which way is up, because I am stuck in an underwater cave.</p>
<p>I have maybe 12 breaths left in my oxygen cylinder, and all I can see is rock texture. The ladder to the surface could be a foot away or 20. Soon, my body shall join those of the divers who came before. Ye gods, I love being this confused in video games.</p><!--more-->
<p>Anoxic Depths offers "3D gameplay in a 2D world", to which the only appropriate response is surely "you magnificent bastards, get the hell in here and also, get the hell out, I never want to see your face again". It casts you as a diver fetching bones, pottery and amulets from procedurally generated underground lakes, at the request of a mysterious researcher.</p>
<p>The researcher "is not a cave diving instructor", <a href="https://www.studiotectorum.com/anoxic-depths/">the developer's official website cautions</a>, which is presumably why there is no tutorial in the demo, just sparse hints from NPCs in the shops and dwellings around the cavemouth. I would appreciate a tutorial, in that Anoxic Depths simulates "decompression sickness" and "pulmonary barotrauma", and I don't quite know what either of these are. But before I can get pulmonary barotrauma, I need to master the art of descending through a world that appears flat.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>, Anoxic Depths deals out its geography in cross-sections. Unlike in Dwarf Fortress, you can roll the view by 90 degree increments, turning a horizontal cross-section into a vertical one. There is no HUD indication of your orientation by default, so you have to really build up a mental map of the volume you're exploring, and count the number of times you've rolled. There are gear items such as diving lines to help you retrace your path to the surface. While we're talking gear, don't forget to switch on your breathing apparatus before you plunge in.</p>
<p>As and when you've got your head round these things, you can try playing the game with a kanji tileset or ASCII, if you want to really layer up the Dwarf Fortress comparisons. Are there any Dwarf Fortress-style procedural demons below? I've yet to encounter one and I sincerely hope not. Imagine trying to elude a Forgotten Beast when you can't remember which way is up.</p>
<p>Thanks to Resetera user Toma for <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/anoxic-depths-roguelike-kanji-scuba-diving-simulator-free-demo.1243713/">passing this on</a>. You can try the demo for yourself on <a href="https://studiotectorum.itch.io/anoxic-depths">Itch.io</a>. It limits how deep you can dive, but saves do carry over to the full game, which will set you back by around the price of a posh supermarket sandwich. For an even more confuzzling take on video game swimming, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/madonna-dark-souls-and-mario-meet-in-a-sweet-and-confounding-swimming-experiment-based-on-a-ps1-obscurity">Water Level/b.l.u.e.
