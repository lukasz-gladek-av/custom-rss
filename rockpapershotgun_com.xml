            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is now set to get an endgame revamp earlier than originally advertised, with Capcom having opted to chuck their established update plans for the next few months out of a window. Well, I say that, all they've really done is move around some bits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-brings-hope-with-newly-lowered-pc-requirements-then-dashes-it-with-a-benchmark-tool">performance issues</a> have proven to be the main achilles heel of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> about hunning mons, the stuff you're left to do once you've slapped up Arkveld has been another source of player ire.</p>

<p>Capcom announced this change in plans via Twitter, outlining via both text and graphic that the "expansion of endgame content" they'd originally penned in for late September's title update three will now be dropping as part of August's version 1.021 update.</p>
<p>The latter update's also had its release date penned in for August 13th, 2025. As for what you can expect from this endgame embiggening, there'll be a new level of quest difficulty and a new rewards system for those quests which'll be based around "Talismans with random skill combinations". That's in addition to 1.021's weapon balance adjustments, which Capcom say "will cover more weapons than originally planned".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p><p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The studio are also teasing some "other improvements and adjustments", so you may well not be out of luck if you're desperate for more performance tweaks. The ones the developers made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">late last month</a> do seem to have helped some players, but judging by the still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo">overwhemingly negative recent Steam reviews</a>, Wilds is still a ways from running as well as your hunter would have to if their Seikret were to suddenly take off without them.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this Wilds update does bring the game a lot closer to what folks ideally want, because clearly the addition of water guns and swimwear as part of its <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1947814137326936487">summer update</a> hasn't quite gotten the entirety of the MonHun masses back on board.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-an-endgame-expansion-ahead-of-schedule-as-capcom-keep-hunting-player-approval]]></content:encoded>
