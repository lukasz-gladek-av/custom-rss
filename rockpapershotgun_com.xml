I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> since its announcement three years ago, Nomura <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1905427039227887864">hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit</a> in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't know, Magic the Gathering is getting an entire Final Fantasy themed set that will probably single handedly get many people into Magic the Gathering. Yesterday, a whole bunch of cards from the set were revealed, including some special ones with fancy art. Unsurprisingly, everyone's favourite long-haired, long-sworded Sephiroth is a card with two bits of art, one with his regular look, the other his final boss form. It's that second one, "Safer Sephiroth", that Nomura has commented on that has me, and many others, wondering if it's actually a nod toward <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> 3 (or whatever it's called).

<p>
"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card. I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked," Nomura explained. "There is also a reason that the design for Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."
</p>
<p>
Of course you can't share more about that, Nomura! When can you! Why even bring it up in the first place? I doubt most people would have even noticed, and now you're going to be fueling fan theories for the next two years. In case you don't know what Safer Sephiroth looked like in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, his right arm was just a wing. In this new art, he has both arms and that wing.
</p>
<p>
What could this mean? Maybe it's to keep Cloud and co out of arm's way (sorry)? Mostly, I have no clue, I'm just quite tickled by the fact that Nomura seems to get a kick out of dropping comments like these. Anyway, I'm off to sell a couple of organs to be able to afford a few booster boxes of this set because I do actually want that Sephiroth card!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-terraria-collab-is-coming-this-summer-though-i-have-some-questions-about-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Crossovers! Collabs! Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled "Tides of Terraria" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as "large", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. "The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518587145533786079">Steam post</a> about the update.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, so you can thank Mario for this one.

            <title><![CDATA[FBC: Firebreak is getting a closed technical test, letting a lucky few try out its oddball FPS stylings]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-is-getting-a-closed-technical-test-letting-a-lucky-few-try-out-its-oddball-fps-stylings.1188426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-is-getting-a-closed-technical-test-letting-a-lucky-few-try-out-its-oddball-fps-stylings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is a bit of a departure from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy's</a> usual games, given that it's a three-player multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a>. The shooty bit is nothing new, that's pretty typical of Remedy's games, even if the shooting always has something slightly off about it. It's the multiplayer angle that sets it apart, and, funnily enough, the fact that Remedy don't always make shooting feel all that great, so it's left me curious as to how it actually plays. I'm assuming some of you feel the same way, and there's some sort of good news: you can sign-up to playtest it this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, big asterisk here. Remedy notes that "due to the limited capacity of this Closed Technical Test, a sign-up does not guarantee access," meaning I would like it if you don't leave a comment blaming me for getting you all excited. That's just the way these tests go, I don't make the rules! 
</p>
<p>
You might want to get yourself signed-up soon though, the test kicks off in a couple of days on May 15th at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 4pm EEST. It'll then run until May 19th, 1:59pm PDT / 4:59pm EDT / 9:59pm BST / 11:59pm EEST, so you'll have a good few days to try it out. The test will be available on PC, of course, as well as those strange things called "consoles" I've heard so much about, like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, and you can sign-up right <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If FBC: Firebreak has somehow flown under your radar, and if it's looking a bit familiar, that's because it's a spinoff of Control (the FBC in its name standing for Federal Bureau of Control). The game is set after the events of the original Control, meaning the Bureau is still having to deal with all the Hiss and weird nonsense that goes on there. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, but in Remedy's universe. A strong concept honestly!
</p>
<p>
Not long to go until it's out either, as the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-will-release-this-june">slated for a June 17th release</a>.
