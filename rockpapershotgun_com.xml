            <p>I adore <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>, to the point that I've finished the uplifting, playful mountain ascent three times. When I tell this to people, one of the most common responses is: hey, you should play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lil-gator-game">Lil Gator Game</a>. I have played Lil Gator Game, and yep: it's good, too. A similarly knockabout outdoor adventure with a cast of vibrant characters. Now it's getting a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1586800/view/509568716255527704">"game-sized"</a> expansion called Lil Gator Game: In The Dark.

<p>Seemingly following on from the events of the original, In The Dark takes place in caves underneath the island you've explored so far. There are new characters to meet and toys to play with, but even underground it seems like you'll be climbing and gliding just as before. I suppose it makes sense, given the original took obvious influence from Breath Of The Wild, that this followup might take some influence from Tears Of The Kingdom - at least as far as an underground setting goes, anyway.
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet.
</p>
<p>I haven't finished Lil Gator Game, but I intend to. It has that CoverGirl energy in that it's easy, breezy, beautiful, with Lil Gator trying desperately to get their older sister's attention and having adventures around an autumnal island in the process. Every corner of it seems stuffed with something playful to do, and there's combat (with cardboard weapons) but very little sense of risk or challenge. Just a good time, from what I played.
</p>
<p>Hayden (RPS in peace) agreed, giving it a Bestest Best in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lil-gator-game-review">Lil Gator Game review</a>. Hopefully In The Dark follows in kind whenever it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205060/Lil_Gator_Game_In_the_Dark/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Making a game about emotionally wayward 20-somethings in a band? You have my sympathies. Night In The Woods nailed the assignment so thoroughly, and is so beloved, that you're in for some tough comparisons. Afterlove EP has plenty going for it that makes it seem like it might be able to hold its own, however. It's set in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, for one. It was conceived of by the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>, another beloved game, for another. 
</p>
<p>It's now got a release date: February 14th.

<p>Maybe I'd have released it the day <em>after</em> Valentine's Day.
</p>
<p>Afterlove EP tells the story of Rama, a musician dealing with the unexpected passing of his girlfriend, Cinta. Rama is working on finishing an EP of music he promised he'd make for her, while struggling to get his band back together and grieve his partner. It's described by its creators as a mix of "narrative adventure, visual novel, rhythm game and life/dating sim", which yes, means there's rhythm game segments where you're playing with your band.
</p><p>The game is being developed by Pikselnesia, an Indonesian indie studio founded by Mohammad Fahmi, the creator of Coffee Talk. Coffee Talk was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/coffee-talk-review">mellow visual novel</a> about making hot drinks and chatting with customers in a coffee shop, and several RPSers fell for its cosy atmosphere. Fahmi passed away during development of Afterlove EP in March, 2022.
</p>
<p>We hope to have a review of Afterlove EP near to release. In the meantime, you'll find more screenshots and trailers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599780/Afterlove_EP/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
