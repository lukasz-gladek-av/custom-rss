            <p>If there's one thing I know about you sickos it's that you love a good city builder. No, don't try to deny it. I have the site traffic data right here and the numbers do not lie (unless they make me look bad to people who outrank me). You people are never happier than when you're wallowing in a bathtub full of upgradeable cottages, taxation sliders and pop satisfaction metrics. It's a disgraceful habit, but I'm not here to judge - not when there's a Steam City Builder &amp; Colony Sim Fest underway.</p><!--more-->
<p>Valve's latest jumpstarting of consumerism's flagging heartbeat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_cities_settlements/?facets40307=12%3A0_2&amp;flavor=popularpurchaseddiscounted&amp;offset=48">runs from now till 31st March</a>, so there's plenty of time to look through the catalogue and its many exotic variations of "city". Town-builders? But of course there are town-builders. Pyramid-builders? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101280/The_Pyraplex/">Sure, why not</a>. Mushroom-builders? OK, I can see you've been working too hard... wait! There <em>is</em> a mushroom-builder. It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521550/Shroomchitect/">Shroomchitect</a> and it's currently roundabouts the price of two, maybe three high street sausage rolls. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In terms of discounts on well-received games, you can get Klei's banging asteroid colony builder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxygen-not-included">Oxygen Not Included</a>, coal-fired dystopia-me-do <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and cutaway 2D skyscraper management sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-highrise">Project Highrise</a> for less than a tenner each. If you're up for risking some sofa change on a relative unknown, the same or less money will get you eco-minded neighbour cultivator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blockhood">Block'hood</a>, the oddball, ramshackle <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945740/Buildings_Have_Feelings_Too/">Buildings Have Feelings Too</a>, and the mystical nomad fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-far-as-the-eye">As Far As The Eye</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you spot any gems going for the price of two, possibly three high street sausage rolls. I confess, I like building cities myself, though it's a genre I seldom find time for because my attention span has been smashed to pieces by daily newswriting. If you know of any building sims that are especially easy to resume playing after long absences, I'd appreciate a recommendation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
