            <p>It never rains but it pours, as we say in old London town. Hard on the heels of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">gargantuan mass layoffs</a> yesterday, which accompany <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">several game cancellations</a> and have also seemingly led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">layoffs at Romero Games</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> developers Techland have reportedly cancelled two projects. They've haven't said which, but in the absence of known alternatives, one of them could be their untitled open world fantasy action-RPG from former employees of CD Projekt.</p><!--more-->
<p>Techland, who are a subsidiary of Tencent via majority stake, are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-in-august-with-the-usual-mix-of-rooftop-parkour-and-zombie-blasting">currently working</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a game of wide open horizons and puckish zombo head-platforming, which I played at Summer Game Fest and mostly enjoyed. Highlights: fleeing super-mutant cadavers in the dark, from rooftop to rooftop. Less fun: having cars thrown at me by a bullet-sponge boss. That's him in the picture there. Up yours, you greasy Bruce Bannerlike.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Techland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-2s-developers-are-ramping-up-work-on-an-open-world-fantasy-rpg">also announced "a new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world"</a>. Last we heard, it was being made by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and The Witcher series, amongst them open world director Bartosz Ochman, narrative director Karolina Stachyra, and narrative lead Arkadiusz Borowik. But all that may be no more, for Techland have just reported losses of 130 million Polish z≈Çoty or roughly $37.3 million, according to Polish business site <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Puls Biznesu</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-has-reportedly-cancelled-two-games/">VGC</a>). These losses stem from "our decision to discontinue further work on two projects."</p>
<p>I'll ask Techland for comment. If you're wondering why there are so many layoffs happening, it's not just the games industry's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">general enshittification</a> - it's the end of a financial quarter, a season in which book-balancers like to get out their red pens and polish the old cost/revenue ratio for the investors.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-developers-techland-are-cancelling-two-games]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week, Hideo Kojima <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">reiterated</a> that he'd really like to make a video game in space, much to Mark's despair and outrage. Perhaps "how do we send Hideo Kojima into outer space" can be one of the problems they solve in the Spaceship Game Jam, a collaboration between the Finnish Game Jam and the European Space Agency, in which starry-eyed developers "design and prototype games or playful concepts inspired by real-world space issues". </p><!--more-->
<p>The event runs August 29th to August 31st. You can join the proceedings in-person at specified sites around Finland, or participate online. There's no entry fee, nor do you need to know what "outer space" is to apply. "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/curiosity">Curiosity</a> and a desire to explore are the only requirements," the organisers explain (yes, I'm aware this website's fiendish autotagging software has just linked "curiosity" to Peter Molyneux's smartphone-chiselling abomination; no, I do not know how to stop it). I think "cosmic dread" should be one of the entry criteria as well. I mean, half the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a> on Steam are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a>.</p>
<p>Why not just host my own damn spacejam, you imperiously enquire, rather than waiting for those stuffed shirts at the ESA to give their blessing? Well, "participants will gain exclusive access to a rich collection of data and assets generously provided by ESA," <a href="https://spaceshipgamejam.org/faq/">according to the project's website</a>. "This collection will include data from satellites, research missions, telescopes, and more, to inspire and enrich your games."</p>
<p>I find the Spaceship Game Jam interesting inasmuch as I'm interested in the overlap between private or public sector space exploration and the video games industry. I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nasa-video-games-call-of-duty-mars">wrote a bit about that for Eurogamer</a>, back in the day, though frankly, I think the piece in question is a sanctimonious blatherfest, so let me extract some highlights: NASA have a sideline in video games development or partnerships with developers as part of their campaign for greater public awareness and, thereby, funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</a> was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/06/27/why-infinite-warfares-space-battles-are-more-grounded-than-you-think.aspx">designed with input from NASA consultants</a>, and NASA has also teamed up with Blackbird Interactive, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Eagle">construct a simulation of a hypothetical 22nd century Martian colony in the Gale Crater</a>. NASA have also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/jedis-to-astronauts-how-nasa-tapped-video-game-maker-for-training.html">made use of educational games for astronaut training</a>.</p>
<p>As for the European Space Agency, they've <a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Branding_and_Partnerships/ESA_connects_space_exploration_and_video_games_at_Gamescom_2024">hosted stands at Gamescom</a> in a bid to recruit the next generation of geeks, and are presently working with Life Is Strange developers Don't Nod on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dontnod-are-working-with-the-european-space-agency-to-make-sci-fi-adventure-game-aphelion">sci-fi adventure game Aphelion</a>. Perhaps if you take part in their game jam, you'll be able to reboot yourself as a professional rocket scientist and help poor, befuddled Kojima escape the tyranny of gravity. He'll get his arse to Mars someday.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-hither-wannabe-astronauts-the-european-space-agency-are-doing-a-spaceship-game-jam]]></content:encoded>
