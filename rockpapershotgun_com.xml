            <p>Virtuos, the company best known for working with other studios to deliver the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-remastered">Dark Souls Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, are reportedly preparing to lay off staff. 300 people are cited as being at risk.</p>
<p>That's according to reporting posted to Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres</a> of French outlet Origami. Andres' post dropped same day Virtuos lead game designer Adrien Jouannet appeared on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> livestream to talk about the studio's work with CD Projekt on the futuristic RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">latest update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Andres reports that 300 Virtuos staff are at risk of redundancy, or around 7% of the company's total staff. <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/about-us/">Virtuos' website</a> cites them as employing over 4200 people in total.</p>
<p>The report suggests these layoffs will primarily affect Virtuos' workers in China, but that staff in other regions of the world will also be hit, including at the French studios that worked with Bethesda on Oblivion Remastered. As of writing, Virtuos have studios based in 25 locations across the world, with five, including UK-based Third Kind Games and a new studio in South Korea, having been acquired by the company since the start of August 2024.

</span></p><p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-delivering on quality relative to the budget, and a contract without royalties (no bonuses tied to the game's success)," reads a translation of Andres' post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gauthier-andres-origami-mass-layoffs-are-currently-underway-at-virtuos-the-studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-and-the-upcoming-mgs-%CE%94-300-people.1245135/">on ResetEra</a> which closely matches a machine translation we've done, "The result: teams were pushed to their limits for a pure showcase project, with its profitability likely to be questioned."</p>
<p>It also asserts that working on the likes of Oblivion Remastered and Snake Eater were part of an effort by Virtuos to shift their strategy towards working on bigger projects or series, rather than lighter remakes. We've reached out to Virtuos for comment.</p>
<p>If these layoffs do come to pass, they'd follow mass job cuts on the other side of the Oblivion Remastered equation.

            <p>Brendan and I once had a podcast conversation about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> in which we predicted that IO Interactive would be limited by James Bond's license holders MGM to a maximum of three toilet drownings, one fish spearing, and absolutely no duck explosions. While we can't yet confirm specifics, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has said that MGM were "a lot more daring than (the studio) thought" in a recent chat with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/">Very Gary Computing</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like they restricted IO very much at all, actually, aside from asking them not to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>'s Bond "a killing machine!". Lacaille actually credits Hitman's, um, restraint in helping them secure the license in the first place.</p>

<p>"In Hitman, you shoot maybe once per level, or not at all, sometimes," Lacaille says, which he thinks helped "open the conversation" with MGM. "If you get to shoot, you kind of fail the mission", he says later. I have been harping on about this forever re: Hitman's pointless amount of guns for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a>, and it is very nice to be vindicated.</p>
<p>This said, it sounds like First Light's Bond might be a bit more gung-ho anyway. Hitman is "a very patient game," Lacaille says, "versus First Light, the character - in a sense - is young and a bit reckless, and sometimes doesnâ€™t have enough patience". Which lines up with earlier comments about IO's Bond being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">"more reckless"</a> than Ian Hitman.</p>
<p>"If the other game is more methodical," he continues, "this one will be more about making you think fast under pressure, giving you a lot of options and you have to think â€“ right, or left, or do you take all these guards? Do you blow your cover? We bring you forward all the time. So in that sense, the game is probably not as open".</p>
<p>But the game will open up more "when it makes sense to," says Lacaille. "When we want to make an homage to what the franchise is about, which is sometimes very big stunts and cinematic moments".</p>
<p>First Light is set for release next year, but IO have already spoken about the potential to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">spin out a trilogy</a> from the game, as well as hinting toward Hitman-style<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things"> post-launch missions</a>, possibly with all the pisser drownings my awful heart could desire.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-bonds-license-holders-let-io-be-a-lot-more-daring-than-the-hitman-studio-thought]]></content:encoded>

Chinese action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is out in a week, and it's high time we heard about the system requirements, which don't seem that high for a game in which you can lob lightning at supersized peacocks and leave a delicate furrow through new-fallen snow.</p>
<p>An Intel Core i5-8400, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 16GB of RAM and 60GB's worth of SSD are all they're asking for the chance to become an amnesiac pirate swordswoman during the age of the Ming dynasty, tasked with murdering a whole lot of bird people before she becomes a bird person herself.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
We have not covered Wuchang since 2021, when Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-looks-like-a-chinese-take-on-bloodborne">pronounced it a Chinese Bloodborne</a>, with the requisite lamentation that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> still isn't on PC. Little birds tell me that developers Leenzee have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-brings-color-to-the-muted-soulslike-genre">tweaked the visuals since then</a> to make the game's setting, Shu, less redolent of Yharnam. Still, parallels abound. As in From Software's game, Shu is subject to a monstrous plague: in this case, it gives everybody feathers. The result is not a realm of jovial bluetit shopkeepers plus the occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)">sobbing mutant Natalie Portman</a>, but a place of bossfights and upgrades. Here's a trailer to catch you up.

Playing as Wuchang, the titular pirate lady, you must rediscover your own past while trying to stave off the Feathering disease. You can use "Red Mercury" to unlock new techniques - guessing it comes from bodies, not pharmacies - and enchant a variety of weapons to inflict escalating grades of buttkick. "As you piece together Wuchang's lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings - each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/">the Steam page comments</a>.

<p>Chaser: the Nvidia hardware above makes use of DLSS 4. If you're not hip to such jargon, don't panic, because I know somebody who is. Here's our hardware editor James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">Nvidia DLSS 4 explainer</a>.</p>
<p>
Chaser 2: If <em>you</em> had to turn into a bird monster, what kind would you prefer? I used to have a thing for albatrosses, with their ginormous wings. They can stay aloft for weeks, allegedly, sleeping in mid-air. No idea whether they're good at parrying, but they should have decent reach.</p>
<p>Also, while we're talking boids, what's the best collective noun for a group of soulslikes? A host? A covert? A murder? OK, I'll shut up now. Wuchang launches on 24th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bird-bashing-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-some-pc-system-specs-and-they-are-not-brutal]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"When our fathers stood against the Persians," spake Greek statesman and general Pericles, "they had no such resources as we have now". Time, of course, muddies the clear waters of specifics, but I'm basically sure he was talking about the ability for each of his men to keep a thirty foot ladder snuggled safely away in their rectal passage just in case they encountered any massive walls.</p>
<p>Which is probably where Total War got the idea from. Since launch, The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> series has given each troop, from the lowliest Chaos Chosen to the bravest and most beautiful ratman, the ability to magic a ladder from nowhere during sieges. There's a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3425174065"> mod for Total War: Warhammer 3 that removes them</a>, but now the end of arse ladders is getting official support, including tweaks to hopefully teach the AI how to behave without them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Joining the ladder changes is a rebalance to siege equipment, and the first of many planned settlement layout reworks. All this comes courtesy of a new Proving Grounds beta, as detailed by battle team lead Milcho Vasilev in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/76-total-war-warhammer-iii-siege-proving-grounds">a new blog</a>. Proving grounds means the changes will only exist in a separate beta branch for a bit, and likely won't go live until players have had a chance to test them and give feedback for iteration.</p>
<p>A bit more detail on the arse ladders. The bung rungs, if you will. The scaffolds that chaff-old. First up, you will be able to toggle your intestinal escalades back on if you wish. No judgement. Something's up there that long, starts to feel like a part of you. Secondly, CA say they've "fixed over 50 issues related to how the Battle AI plays" in sieges in general, so they might now have some devious new ideas of how to cope without the ladders.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, towers are getting their range reduced but their damage buffed, and gates will be more durable. You'll be able to build siege towers and battering rams quicker, and their speed and durability has been adjusted. "In addition," reads the blog, "we are changing the way Siege Attrition works and turning it into a linear progression making it be stronger and stronger with each consecutive turn a settlement remains under siege".</p>
<p>Do have a read of the blog for the full breakdown. This beta round runs for two weeks, from the 24th of July to the 7th of August. There'll also be a livestream with Vasilev on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/totalwar">Twitch</a> today at  3:30PM BST/2:20PM UTC/4:30PM CEST. I don't think they've done a dev stream for a while, and I'm a sucker for the nitty gritty stuff they've been sharing more of recently. Rest in pelvic prolapse, arse ladders.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-total-war-warhammers-arse-ladders-2016-2025]]></content:encoded>
