            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a>? I acknowledge that this might come across as a tad mean, but in this ridiculously fast-paced world we find in, it can genuinely be hard to remember one failed live service game from the next. For a refresher, this was Ubisoft's attempt at a battle royale game back in 2020, though it didn't pan out as it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-battle-royale-hyper-scape-will-shut-down-this-april">shut down only a couple of years later</a>. Well, anyway, it's back! Sort of, not quite, but it might soon, or actually probably eventually, will be thanks to the efforts of a group of people hoping to revive it.
</p>
<p>
Over on Zitter, a user by the name of Fiirce shared a clip playing a very sparsely populated version of the games (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battle-royale-shooter-hyper-scape-gets-fan-revival-project">Eurogamer</a>). The post refers to it as Hyper Scape Revival, though I'm not sure if that'll be the official name of this rebirth. For now, the game is only currently playable singleplayer, and it'll apparently be a while before a multiplayer version is available, with the post noting it could take months or even years. Sorry to say that if you've got any interest in playing it, you'll have to hold out, as it's just being tested privately right now.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years).

I never played a lick of Hyper Scape myself, primarily because I'm not a shooter guy, but also because aesthetically I found it to be quite dull (and honestly likely a notable factor as to why it didn't really take off). That isn't to say it didn't put an interesting spin on the genre, instead of the classic enclosing circle, different sections of the map would disappear, which certainly makes for some big changes in terms of the spatial experience of it all.
</p>
<p>
I'm also just always enthused by the reclamation of a game like this. Whether Ubisoft will do anything or not is obviously up in the air, but I reckon they're a bit too busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">trying to lay off a bunch of staff</a> (and dealing with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">massive strike</a>).

I think that with a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, you'd be well within your right to have an eyebrow pre-raised considering its online, sort of free-to-play (depending on where you live) predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> regarding the like of microtransactions. I know I certainly have! At a glance Crimson Desert certainly looks like it could fall into similar pitfalls if only based on vibes alone. However! Developer Pearl Abyss would quite like you to know that, in that regard at least, you have nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">Dropped Frames show</a> (ta, <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217">Okami13_</a>), marketing director at Pearly Abyss America Will Powers explained, "I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions. It’s a monetisation model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop."
</p>
<p>
This is, admittedly, an annoying thing to have to be thankful for. I sure would like it if games weren't designed to exploit the most exploitable of us! Still, it's something, even if this doesn't totally rule out other bits of, admittedly still annoying but slightly less so, DLC, expansions and the like.
</p>
<p>
Last month, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game got a bit more of a lengthier look-in which quite honestly befuddled me at points. It's obviously very much a medieval fantasy setting, but it's just so realistic looking that the flashy particle effects, literal mechs, and just straight up dragons feel like they don't contrast as well as they potentially might in a more stylised setting. Ah well, at least you only have to pay for it all once!
