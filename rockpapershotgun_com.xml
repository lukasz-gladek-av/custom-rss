            <p>
My first game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-the-open">Lost In The Open</a> came to a sticky end in the borderlands, when my ragtag group of dog-eared bodyguards and hastily-recruited vagrants encountered the full flower of the Strathian military. Outnumbered, underlevelled and already bloodied, my warriors struggled to make a dent on the gleaming Strathian plate, and were swiftly surrounded and slaughtered. 
</p>
<p>
It was at this point that I realised I had fled too efficiently through the mountains and forests. I should have spent more time grinding bandits, looting old forges, and putting aside resources for the inevitable midboss encounter. I'm not sure I can be blamed for my haste, though. After all, I am a nearly-dead king, the survivor of an assassination attempt during a diplomatic dinner, and there is a whole army sweeping over the countryside behind me.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The work of Stockholm-based Black Voyage Games, Lost In The Open is a "low-fantasy" tactics RPG that combines the roguelike running-away of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> with something like the mood and art direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wildermyth">Wildermyth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banner-saga">The Banner Saga</a>. It casts you as King Nrvesk, known throughout the lands for being a total bastard, which is why somebody's just shoved a knife into him.

<p>
Starting out with a handful of surviving guards - two, on "Merciful" difficulty - you will flee north from the capital of Stratha, trying to reach your home realm of Ruedome before the Strathaian vanguard overtakes you in a sea of red hexagons. Each map node contains a battle, a resourcing opportunity, or a more ambiguous, perhaps multiple-part story quest. I met a nice noblewoman who wanted me to retrieve an heirloom from robbers, for example. I will leave you to discover whether I was unwise to accept.
</p><p>
Picking a fight in Lost In The Open can be very consequential. Units have a chance of dying permanently when KO'd, and even if they finish the fight upright, it'll take them a while to heal afterwards, consuming medical supplies in the process. Capital-i Injuries may become Marred, distorting the unit's stats, unless they are properly tended to. Needless to say, if King Nrvesk cops it, your run is over. 
</p>
<p>
You'll need to regularly risk battle, though, because it's vital to level up and gather scrap and gold for bartering and upgrades. Sooner or later, there will be a combat you can't avoid. You also need to make friends along the way - both recruiting soldiers, and forging alliances through quests that might pay dividends down the road.
</p>

<p>
The battle system itself is entertaining, if familiar. Characters act according to an initiative bar, and take more damage when attacked in the flanks or rear. Each unit has a degradeable armour layer that saves them from health loss, though some abilities can get around it. Warriors fall into such archetypes as crossbowmen who must spend action points to reload, tanky shieldbros who can absorb blows directed at adjacent friendlies, and screamy berserkers with power moves that deal extra damage based on how many foes have already been moidered. 
</p><p>
It doesn't seem as in-depth as the games I invoked in my intro, but I'm basing that observation on a cheeky 62 minutes with the Steam demo. The full game launches into early access on 26th September, with the first of three acts, plus "5 factions with 20 unit types (most are recruitable), 3 zones, 3 biomes, a wide variety of terrains, 6 boss encounters, and hundreds of unique events to discover." 
</p>
<p>
Among the things I'm curious about is whether King Nrvesk will have to mend his ways enroute to Ruedome - that "rue" is doing a lot of thematic heavy lifting here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2027380/Lost_In_The_Open/">The Steam page</a> suggests that "you must recruit strategically, fight desperately and repent sincerely", but perhaps I can "repent strategically", instead. I'm pretty sure Machiavelli has something to say about timely apologies?

            <p>Whoops, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s release date has reportedly leaked via some swiftly pulled Amazon Japan listings. The apparent leak, which precedes a PlayStation State of Play showcase set for later today (September 24th), has also laid bare some deets as to what the game's swankier Treasure Box Edition includes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to these listings spotted by a Twitter user with the handle <a href="https://x.com/Renka_schedule/status/1970717557629047193">@renka_schedule</a> and reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">Gematsu</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> 3 will arrive on PC via Steam as of February 6, 2026. With the listings slating the PS5 version to drop that same day, that would mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/That'd%20mean%20no%20waiting%20for%20a%20PC%20release%20once">no extra waiting for us PC folks to get our hands on it</a>, which'd be a very nice surprise.</p>
<p>According to the listings, plumping for the Treasure Box edition of the game'll net you an art book, a copy of the soundtrack, a desk mat, and a Sunekosuri hairball key chain. The Sunekosuri, in case you've not brushed up on your Japanese Yokai recently, are "small, mischievous spirits from Okayama Prefecture" resembling either a dog or a cat.</p>
<p>"Sunekosuri run up behind people walking on dark, rainy nights," reads the description on Japanese spirit database  <a href="https://yokai.com/sunekosuri/?srsltid=AfmBOopopGblI7eHi5tYpfmqRPIy8NQmusm-Zl4mMq9mTwXVjOofASbN">Yokai.com</a>. "They rub against their shins, weave in and out of their legs, nuzzle against the knees, and otherwise make it difficult to walk. They do not intentionally cause any harm to humans, although occasionally their rubbing is strong enough to make a person stumble or even knock them down." Well, today's the day I've found out that my cat's an indoor Sunekosuri.</p><p>But I digress, the leak also looks to have revealed Nioh 3's box art early, so feast your eyes on that via the link to the Tweeter above, physical media buffs. Assuming the release date's accurate, you'll have about a week to finish Nioh 3 before jumping into the freshly announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, assuming you're planning on playing both on release. Or you could just be sensible and take your time, I guess.</p>
<p>Today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youtube.com/watch?v=0QcEoGC51ZY">PlayStation State of Play</a> kicks off at 10PM BST/5PM ET/2PM PT. We'll bring you any big PC-relevant news that comes out of it, and dutifully stick our fingers in our ears for the console-specific bits.</p>

            <p>Like A Dragon/Yakuza devs RGG Studio have revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 &amp; Dark Ties, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3</a> paired with a fresh spin-off adventure starring the beat-em-up's baddie Yoshitaka Mine. They'll be released as one package on February 12th, 2026, as announced at the latest RGG Summit showcase.</p>
<p>The showcase also saw the studio announce that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/?curator_clanid=44982177">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>, originally released as a Switch 2 launch title, will arrive on PC December 8th. That revamp of the most 80s entry in the series offers some extra cutscenes and a Red Light Raid multiplayer mode all about battling hordes of goons.</p>

<p>While a remastered version of Yakuza 3 did hit Steam back in 2021, Kiwami 3 is a more in-depth face-lift, in line with the Kiwami treatments the first two games in the series have gotten. That means a full remake, with RGG promising "more intense battles, added cutscenes that bring depth to the story, and minigames chock-full of replay value" in addition to retooled visuals.</p><p>Here's a quick Steam page synopsis of Yakuza 3's plot, in case you need a refresher: "Kazuma Kiryu has earned his retirement on the sandy beaches of Okinawa. But when a deadly power struggle arrives on his doorstep, he’ll have to walk the streets of Kamurocho to escape his past for good."</p>
<p>The most newsworthy addition is definitely Dark Ties, a fresh spin-off adventure which puts you in the shoes of businessy Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine. If you hop into Dark Ties from the remake's main menu, you'll get to see how he established himself in the underworld after crashing out of the corporate one, forming deep bonds with Tojo Clan chairman Daigo Dojima and more typical Yakuza villain Tsuyoshi Kanda in the process.</p>
<p>It's been a few years since I played Yakuza 3, but I recall liking Mine as a change of pace from the brawnier brawlers Kiryu tends to have to wrest the clan away from, with his cold and calculating persona certainly being a lot different to direct predecessor and Yakuza 2 baddie Ryuji Goda. It's certainly nice to see RGG doing more with one of the villains from the Yakuzas 3 to 5 range, given those poor lads are generally pretty forgettable compared to series cornerstones like Goda and Akira Nishkiyama.</p>
<p>There's a deluxe edition of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties which comes with some extra goodies, while costing £69.99 in comparison to the base game's £54.99/$59.99/€59.99. I've mainly mentioned it because one of the additions is called the 'Legendary Lads Set', which is a very good name. It also features some flip phone customisation, though there regrettably don't look to be any embarrassing 2000s ringtones.</p>
<p>You can wishlist this refreshed street scum sweeper <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/">on Steam</a> right now.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-rebirth">Amnesia: Rebirth</a> developers Frictional are teasing what appears to be a new sci-fi game by way of a sneaky update to their deep sea <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> venture <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soma">Soma</a>.

<p>On Monday, the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/282140/view/542243094205040852?l=english">quietly patched</a> the decade-old Soma to fix "faulty spam filters" on protagonist Simon's PC, which you can surf briefly at the very start of the game. "Users may still receive suspicious correspondence due to treemail 0.1 filtering process issues," the changelog notes. Then, there's a line of illegible text.

<p>Dutifully firing up Soma and checking out Simon's inbox, we find a new message with the subject line: "[Virus Error] You've Ea%ned it". The email is addressed to [HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUAL], and is a garbled invitation to invest in something called "Hotel Samsara" (as helpfully deciphered by Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyVUDnIUON8">CheeseYen</a>). Hotel Samsara has <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">a website with a sign-up page</a>, and that website is hella creepy.

<p>"Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond," reads the About section. "Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing, Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious. In Samsara, wishes will come true. Interested in investing?" There is also a sinister animation of what appears to be the hotel lobby. It shows a circular golden wall decoration through shadowy, spiky ferns. My guess is that if you invest in Hotel Samsara, your dividends will take the form of dismemberment/mutation and a sense of cosmic despair.
</p><p>The page also includes endorsements of LuxuryNext, written by western-sounding executives from various trust funds and hospitality cartels. "Return on investment, time and time and time again. I really do wonder what their secret is?" writes Deborah RD Tory of Gilded Greens Group. There is mention of a man called Felix, who appears to be head of LuxuryNext. The quotes portray him as a "fearless" maverick and risk-taker. Sounds like obvious villain material to me. Bet he has a secret laboratory of some kind. Bet he has funny ideas about reincarnation. It's perhaps too easy to draw parallels with certain realworld billionaires who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Donald_Trump">made a portion of their megabucks from very expensive hotels</a>.
</p>
<p>As for "samsara" or "saṃsāra", I can say little beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">pointing you at the Wikipedia page</a>, which characterises it as a Sanskrit term for the "cyclicity of all life, matter, and existence". It suggests that the Hotel Samsara game will be another one of Frictional's spooky philosophical thought experiments. The website also includes what appears to be in-game imagery of a circular geometric pattern that resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">mandala</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavacakra">bhavachakra</a>.
</p>
<p>I spoke to one of Frictional's top brass at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last year. He mentioned that they had one or two unannounced projects on the boil, following the very good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>. Given that it was teased in Soma, the Hotel Samsara game is likely to be a sequel, but it could also be a new Amnesia game - Amnesia has explored connections between its debts from Lovecraft and real-world religious concepts and folklore, as in the djinn passages from Rebirth. With all that in mind, I'm a little worried about the game being an orientalising dog's dinner of ideas from Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, but I guess they've allowed for that by presenting it all as the queasy branding of a corporation in-game.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps we'll get a trailer in the course of Tokyo Game Show this week - or tonight's <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/">surprise State Of Play broadcast from Sony</a>. In the meantime, there is probably more to glean or decipher from that website. Let me know if you stumble on any fresh details.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Oh look at that - the hotel website privacy policy redirects to <a href="https://kepler-interactive.com/pages/privacy-policy">Kepler Interactive</a>.</p>
