            <p>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-the-ants">Empire Of The Ants</a> understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.</p>

<p>It is gorgeous, isn’t it? Like a Big Dave doc, minus Big Dave himself, which doesn’t sound that amazing now I type it. I’m especially into the bit where the ant says he’ll “assemble the legions immediately”, which feels a disastrously silly interpretation of how ant communication actually works, but is too much fun for me to get upset about. Also, worth pointing out that Empire Of The Ants is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth">Empires Of The Undergrowth</a>. One has a big frog in it, and the other has a big football. Easy. Also, this one has pvp. Any other notable features? Let’s ask the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/">Steam page</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an immersive journey and defend your lands through tactical and strategic battles in an epic, microscopic world. Play as 103,683rd, an ant of the warrior caste with an inquisitive mind: explore the Federation and fight for it, conquering new territories. Exploring, strategizing, and forging alliances with the local wildlife will be crucial to emerge victorious from the many challenges lying ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are a few features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Shape your strategy by choosing your roster wisely: starting, support, and super-predator legions.</li>
<li>Upgrade your nest’s tier to access new and stronger legions. Will you opt for the defensive Snail or the mobility of the Rhino Beetles?</li>
<li>Adapt your strategy by building the right chambers: build your economy, manage your legions, gather Information on the battlefield, gain new Powers, or strengthen your Defense.</li>
<li>Not enough space? Conquer other nests to expand your territory and get stronger.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You’ll be doing all this in a “20 hour campaign”, based on Bernard Werber’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Ants_(novel)">novel of the same name</a>. When you’re done with that, there’s 1v1 matchmaking and three-way free-for-alls. If you’re undecided about this one, it releases in just a few days on the 7th of November, and I guarantee you there will be several let’s players doing the worst David Attenborough you’ve ever heard, alongside at least one doing a really good one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Early reactions to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer range from frothing dislike through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-ops-6-leak-gives-naughty-players-get-access-to-the-max-payne-ish-omnimovement-system-for-the-first-time">omnimovement hype</a> to our own Ed Thorn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">dead-eyed appraisal</a> that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The fix for players spawning right after joining matches in progress, without the courtesy of a loadout selection screen, sits alongside "general spawn logic tuning across several maps for improved spawning". In the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4">Blopsblog</a>, the developers caution readers that "spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment", adding that "our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes." 
</p>
<p>
How safe can a spawn point be, before it starts to confer an unfair advantage? I'm interested to read more about how spawn systems work. I picture the Black Ops 6 spawn system as a genetically engineered octopus, floating in a tank over model of each map. The octopus has been specially trained to place spawn points on demand by touching the map with each tentacle, but being an octopus, it sometimes loses interest or decides to chew on a small model of an AC-130 gunship instead. They keep the octopi in the same room as the thousands of monkeys they've got trained to typewriters, striving to write the perfect Call Of Duty campaign. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8">It was the blurst of times indeed</a>.
</p><p>
In the room along from the octopi/monkey chamber, there's a room full of budgerigars who dynamically alter the game's weapon balancing by screeching "assault rifle", "submachine gun" and "shotgun" at different volumes. The new patch makes some "early, general changes" to the effective ranges of assault rifles and SMGs. "For ARs, we are pulling in minimum damage ranges and lessening the impact of headshots at close range," it reads. "SMGs are receiving damage range increases to improve their mid-range effectiveness."
</p>
<p>
As for shotguns, shotgun slugs to the body will no longer cause one-hit kills for the foreseeable. The developers say that this particular shotgun attachment "performs better in hip fire than intended" - it's supposed "to offer an alternate playstyle for shotguns that trades close quarters effectiveness for improved range and precision".
</p>
<p>
As noted, the patch also temporarily donates a set portion of safehouse funds to campaign players affected by a glitch that causes "extreme positive or negative currency values". I do like Black Ops 6's safehouse. Wish there were more to it, really. I want to be able to play actual tunes on that piano. But I'll leave it to Brendy to deliver the final verdict, there - he's been working on our Black Ops 6 campaign review while Ed tackles the multiplayer.

What’s more, maker Edmund McMillen has announced that the foretold online co-op update is due on the 18th of this month, alongside a “considerable” balance update. Consider me considering the considerability of said considerable update!</p>

<p>“Isaac online will feature a full online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mode (with completion markers) alongside a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad,” <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">Ximbled McMillen</a>. The game has had local mate mode for a while now, but BinHeads have been anticipating this online update since McMillen said it was coming “soon” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-binding-of-isaac-is-getting-online-multiplayer-soon">last year</a>.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou will be able to play with random matches or friends” - four of them - confirmed executive producer Tyrone Rodriguez <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">at the time</a>. Also confirmed were tracked winstreaks, the ability to load up specific seeds, and one item per player for boss rooms and treasure chests.</p><p>McMillen’s Xeet also features a load of concept art, boss designs, and storyboards, so worth having a looksie if you’re a real BumHead. “TBOI takes over people's lives, despite being a short and entirely beatable game, because every new combination of random enemies and random items manages to feel like a brand new adventure, infinitely more important than any you've had so far,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review">wrote</a> Alec Meer (RPS in peace) back in 2014.</p>
<p>McMillen is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> - a game I’ve been waiting for since it was announced over a decade ago. The last we saw of the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> feline fuse ‘em up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shaky-cam-footage-emerges-of-edmund-mcmillens-turn-based-cat-tics-mewgenics">this here shaky cam footage</a> last year. The creator has previously described the game as "like a bunch of things, but not like anything else. It really feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets Pokémon meets some sort of D&amp;D-type adventure game, with an Animal Crossing hub". Stop. You had me at cats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
