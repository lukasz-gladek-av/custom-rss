            <p>
Last month, something a bit surprising, and perhaps concerning, took place in the games industry: a deal was made which saw that a mixture of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had privately acquired EA. There's a whole host of reasons why this is worrisome, but one reason in particular is the way that it might affect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it isn't exactly a paragon of identity politics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> has by and large been a game that welcomes and encourages people of all creeds, notably LGBTQIA+ folks. It is probably safe to assume that these new owners, however, will not be so welcoming. In fact, concern has been so great over this acquisition that the biggest Sims YouTuber around lilsimsie has <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6?si=sglHvJEekR-fr1md">left EA's Creator Network</a>, having been joined by other big Sims YouTubers like <a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53?si=OTATMfwD8usqaILA">Plumbella</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=4KaoEumB9X0jgD7u">James Turner</a>.

<p>
In turn, a message has now been shared by The Sims team on its official Dwitter account seemingly attempting to assuage some of the above concerns, though it has been delivered in a bit of a vague tone. "We're continually inspired by our incredible players and creators; by your imagination, creativity, and the joy you bring to The Sims every day," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply respect that everyone experiences The Sims in their own way and will make choices that are right for them. However you choose to play, create, or share, weâ€™re grateful to be part of your journey. Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same. The Sims will always be a space where you can express your authentic self."
</p><p>
The statement carries on with an even vaguer bit about how everyone's "passion and voices" have affected bits to come in 2026, and that on November 4th there'll be a new update coming to The Sims with "150+ fixes and fresh freebies." Notably, this update is "the first of ongoing updates that address the things that matter most to you," though personally this feels slightly disconnected from the main message and is more addressed at those who are frustrated with how broken the game often can be.
</p>
<p>
This is all well and good for now, it's just still a bit too early to tell what kind of effects this acquisition will have. For now let's all just cross our fingers for the future of any staff members currently working at EA.
