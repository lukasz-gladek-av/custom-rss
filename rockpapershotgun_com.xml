            <p>There's another message about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s Coronations DLC for you to read, sire. Developers PDS Black have apologised for the update not being up to par, and issued the first of multiple patches aimed at rectifying its issues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, this add-on fleshes out ascending to the throne in the crown-heavy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game a bit more, as well as letting you set a key goal for your regime. It arrived earlier this week, and the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">quickly sank to mostly negative</a>. The main gripes were buggy oaths - you can swear oaths at the end of coronations, earning rewards if you fulfil your oath on time - and whether gating some relatively small-scale yet significant features behind paid DLC was justified.</p>
<p>Paradox have now responded to that backlash, with a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">statement penned by Riad</a>, a QA manager at Crusader Kings 3 developer PDS Black. Writing that the Coronations wasn't "up to the standard you deserve", the developer continued: "It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p>
<p>According to Riad, the upcoming All Under Heaven DLC, which'll expand the game's map into China, Japan and southeast Asia, has required the vast majority of the studio's attention and resources. As a result, the team working on the smaller Coronations had to get by with "limited resources" and less staff.</p><p>"As a studio, we’re taking a hard look at how we assign resources, and support our developers so that every release meets the expectations you rightfully have," the QA manager wrote. "For example, we will be more stringent about allowing last-minute changes to the game (which can cause issues like broken oaths). We will also ensure that we dedicate more time towards full-length playthroughs throughout the entire development cycle, to ensure that issues like these can’t slip through."</p>
<p>Riad added that it "hurts so much when we fuck up like this", and that the studio will be aiming to earn back the trust of players. That'll likely be a very tall order given that this is hardly a one-off for Paradox. The publishers have acquired a bit of a reputation for regularly releasing DLC which is either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-releasing-the-worst-reviewed-game-on-steam">low quality</a>, viewed as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">unnecessary extra monetisation</a>, or some combo of the two. The latter's been front and centre recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s paid DLC clans, a mess we're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">currently waiting to see the full extent of Paradox's cleanup plans</a> for. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you're ready to trust Paradox again, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> devs have quickly put out a patch aimed at fixing the main issues with Coronations' oaths. Riad also specified that there'll be "at least one more patch" for the DLC coming, "to fix many of the issues we encountered ahead of the release, but didn’t have enough time to fix". You can find the full notes for the first patch, which is out now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991?l=english">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
You want an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update? You've got an Assassin's Creed Shadows update! Well, you will tomorrow, September 11th anyway, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> did release the patch notes for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game in any case. Here's what you can expect for the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 title update! First up is the fact that the game will be ready for its first expansion, Claws of Awaji, which is due out next week, September 16th. The level cap is also being raised to 100 to account for the expansion!
</p>
<p>
For everyone who won't be picking up the expansion, there is a new free story quest, Go With The Bo. Here you'll join Junjiro as he sets out to meet a legendary Bo master and a new weapon that Naoe can use, the Bo staff. There's also new hideout upgrades, including two more upgrade levels, 20 new enhancements, and three new Hideout levels. Upgrading the Nando to level two will now give you the ability to meditate and move the time forward to the next six o'clock, AM or PM.
</p>
<p>
If you upgrade the study to level four, scouts will now have the ability to reveal viewpoints and safehouses, and with upgrading the Kakurega to the same level, uncovering all viewpoints within a province reveals it completely.
</p>
<p>
There are two new gear quality tiers that you can upgrade your kit to if you've got your forge to level six, called mythic and artifact. "Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential," the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv/ac-shadows-title-update-111-release-notes">patch notes</a> explain.
</p><p>
Ubisoft still can't seem to let go of Ezio either, as in the Animus Hub there are some fresh rewards for a new project called Sanctuary. These include Ezio's outfit, Ezio's outfit but for a cat, an Ezio-themed kusarigama, and a Charm of Firenze trinket.
</p>
<p>
There are also new anomalies to be found in Awaji if you own the expansion, and cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS. You'll also find a number of other fixes and tweaks, but you can read the full patch notes to learn about those small details.
