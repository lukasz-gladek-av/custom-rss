            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which google reliably informs me is a vehicle that's supposed to carry fighting infantry, rather than fight infantry itself, has had its lock-on missiles taken away for the next little bit. Some problems with countermeasures have rendered them far too effective at their job of blowing stuff up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA have confirmed the temporary switching off of these missiles in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986379990624088520">post on the hellsite</a>, putting it down to a need to "address inconsistencies witnessed with this vehicle's countermeasures". That appears to be code for countermeasures designed to prevent the likes of jets and tanks being blown to bits a bit too often and from across the map <a href="https://x.com/NerosCinema/status/1979681088399393159">not always doing their job properly</a> to have a chance of stopping the IFV's missiles in their tracks.</p>
<p>So, no missiles for now, with EA aiming to fix the problem in an update set to drop next week. In the meantime, maybe make missile lock and firing noises with your mouth whenever you spot a plane or chopper you'd like to knock out of the sky.</p> 
<p>Based on a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986043954106626391">post</a> from DICE lead producer David Sirland last night, that next patch will also include fixes for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">rooftop exploits</a> on maps like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and Empire State. These have been seeing pesky players use drones to spirit themselves up to high ground they shouldn't be able to reach, by standing atop the tech and whacking it with a sledgehammer in a fashion that weirdly remind me of the hand-cranked mine carts you get in westerns.</p><p>All of this comes as the devs continue to fiddle around with how much XP is dished out and required by certain activities, with a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">revamp of challenges and assignments</a> having arrived yesterday. "Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length," EA said of those tweaks.</p>
<p>We'll see how many of these sorts of ongoing issues and gripes end up being locked onto and wiped out by that upcoming patch.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft have reportedly offered a corporate spin on the backlash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> faced from right-wing grifters prior to release, with CEO Yves Guillemot framing it as "a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message". The company also seem to be trying to canonise the events as some kind of masterful marketing victory, which arguably isn't too surprising, even if the fact they're not trying to pretend the controversy never happened is. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, a marketing video about the backlash was shown during last week's Paris Games Week, with Guillemot subsequently making some comments further outlining how the corp - at least in terms of image they're aiming to present to industry event attendees - have chosen to interpret what happened in hindsight.</p>
<p>"We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies," the video declared. "We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks," Guillemot said afterwards, according to Game File's translation. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</p>
<p>Aside from that, which <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">mirroring what the exec said</a> at the height of the controversy, the narrative being conveyed by the presentation looks to have been that Ubisoft scored a win by smartly opting to delay the game to polish it more and running a charm offensive along the lines of 'come on folks, this is just Assassin's Creed, you all like that'.</p><p>On one hand, it's exactly how you'd expect a company to paint a their response to what was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">overwhelmingly a lot of online dickheads</a> being angry that Yasuke existed, was black, was a samurai, and was in a video game. On the other, it's sigh-inducing that this retelling seemingly left out or minimised elements like how Assassin's Creed lead Marc-Alexis Coté, who's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft</a>, actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defended his team's vision</a> for the game, in contrast to Guillemot's declaration that it was just a bit of brains-off entertainment.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-an-assassins-creed-set-in-post-civil-war-america-due-to-us-politics-and-yasuke-backlash">reported cancellation</a> of an Assassin’s Creed set in post-Civil War America back in 2024, over execs' concerns about the US' current political climate. Apparently that was one battle in which Ubisoft didn't back themselves to "fire up allies" and defeat what the marketing video reportedly called "the loudest haters".</p>

            <p>Oi, gaffer! I know you're busy trying to work out the exact moment at which we should park the bus and start unleashing the long throw-ins, but you'll probably want to know about the chunky patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> devs Sports Interactive have released into Steam beta. It's aimed at fixing a lit of the initial issues which've been causing ire since release earlier this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update delivers over three hundred fixes and quality of life improvements," the studio wrote in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3551340/view/615431029997437073?l=english">Steam announcement</a> of this beta patch. "Key highlights include new preferences for adjusting attribute colours, a preference to turn off/alter the speed of UI transitions, as well as a 1.5x Match Speed option, all introduced in response to your early beta feedback."</p>
<p>Beyond those, some tweaks which've caught my eye include "substantial crash and stability fixes", "further fixes to matches Freezing at start of the second half in single-player career", and "manually scouting a player will now correctly delegate an appropriate scout". Alright, if I'm being honest, those ones just strike me as useful, the following really caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where white match ball would be used in snowy weather</li>
<li>Fixed issue forcing user to holiday past end of season team meeting</li>
<li>Overall start/until dates within Club &gt; Finances &gt; Debts &amp; Loans will no longer display 01/01/1900</li>
<li>Fixed issue where player would reject the own asking price that they themselves had set</li>
<li>Manager attire choices will now save correctly</li>
<li>'Exit Talks' button now functions correctly within Contract Negotiations</li>
</ul>
<p>This barrage of tweaks is just the start, with Sports Interactive revealing: "The next update for the beta track is already underway (details to follow), and it’s set to introduce a legacy preference to advance through messages with the spacebar, which we’ve been working on since the initial beta feedback came in."</p><p>So far Football Manager 26's critic reception <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/football-manager-26/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">looks pretty mixed</a>, while user reviews have skewed much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/#app_reviews_hash">more negatively</a>. We've got our own review in the works, so make sure to look out for that if you're taking the wait-and-see approach before donning your monogrammed tracksuit.</p>
<p>To give this beta patch a go, you'll need to head to the manage button on the game's listing in your Steam library, then properties, then betas, and select public beta from the private betas drop-down menu. It's the standard path you'll be familiar with if you're a veteran of Steam betas.</p>
