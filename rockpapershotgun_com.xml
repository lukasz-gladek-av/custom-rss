            <p>Civilization is a series in thrall to the illusion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth">endless incremental progress</a>, and what more bruisingly poetic way to refute that narrative than by sticking two fingers up at this year's ailing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> and opting to play 2016's much better-regarded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> instead. Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">The Epic Games Store giveaway</a> is for Civ 6's Platinum Edition, which includes the Vikings Scenario Pack, the Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, and the Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, plus two big expansions: Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm.</p>
<p>After all the yelling, shouting, explosions and assorted farmyard noises in response to Civilization 7, it is kind of terrifying to revisit Adam Smith's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a> from 2016. "Civ VI demands flexibility of thought and function, and it rewards it handsomely with a game that responds elegantly to all kinds of different playstyles," he wrote, concluding that "it is, quite simply, a thing of wonder, and a late contender for my personal game of the year." </p>
<p>It was subsequently consecrated as RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-2016-civilization-6">best 4X of 2016 in the year's Advent Calendar</a>, and stands firm (appropriately) at 6th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">best PC strategy games</a>. (You all ranked it at 13th on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">own list</a> because what is the average RPS reader if not a chuckling contrarian.)</p>
<p>I want to go back. Still, perhaps with enough updating and patching, Civ 7 will shine similarly. Civilization tends to play the long game, after all. The next major update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">will add auto-exploration for scouts and smoothed-out Age transitions</a>. It feels like if they can figure out the controversy over the Age mechanic, the rest might fall into place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-youve-given-up-on-civilization-7-civ-6-is-free-with-all-dlc-expansions-for-a-limited-time-on-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alongside working on The Duskbloods and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s post-launch bits, FromSoftware are reportedly deep in development on an unannounced game that could release next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which claims said game is codenamed FMC, multiplatform and - based on "the nature of the source these details come from" - at an advanced stage of development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The site alleges that unless this game is delayed, it could be in line for a 2026 release. That's the extent of the report's concrete info, with it then dissecting the various codenames given to other FromSoft game while they were in the works.</p>
<p>Since a number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> projects and Armored Core 6 all had codenames beginning with F, as this mystery game reportedly does, MP1st speculate that FMC could be related to one of those series. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, meanwhile, had the snappy moniker SPRJ, so it'd appear you may well be barking up the wrong gothic tree if a PC port of that was your go-to guess.</p>
<p>FMC. Hmmmmmm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s codename was GR, short for Great Rune. Maybe this is Fuck, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a>'s Cool? Four Massive Cats? Frustratingly Melancholy Chambers? Fear Magical Chairs? Failure, My Chums? Fight Man Crush, with all six thousand things that could mean?</p>
<p>Full Macarena Confidence? Alright, stop there. I'm going with that one. FromSoft collabing with the lyrical talents of Los del RÃ­o, who really are the music industry's George R.R Martin, to give you the ego boost you need to accomplish cosa buena.</p>
<p>What do you mean Miyazaki and co would never do that? Whatever, I can't hear you over the sound of vaguely Spanish dancing. As VGC point out, the director made clear <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-promises-switch-2-exclusive-duskbloods-wont-distract-fromsoftware-from-single-player-games/">earlier this year</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods don't signal the studio moving away from the sorts of single player games they made their name with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-are-reportedly-working-on-an-unannounced-game-alongside-the-duskbloods-that-could-release-next-year]]></content:encoded>
