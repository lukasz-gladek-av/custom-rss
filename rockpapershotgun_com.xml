            <p>Microsoft have announced plans to roll out a policy which will mandate that staff return to working from the office at least three days per week, with a first phase of it set to come into force as of February 2026.</p>
<p>In a memo about the move shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">The Verge</a>, Microsoft executive vice president and chief people officer Amy Coleman asserted that it's "not about reducing headcount". The mandate comes just a couple of months after the company's mass layoffs which saw about 9,000 employees let go and several games cancelled. The bloodletting hasn't stopped since that point either, with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-layoffs-continue-into-5th-consecutive-month/">The Seattle Times</a> reporting this week that Microsoft have laid off a further 42 employees, bringing the total to 15,000 since May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive — they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results," Coleman wrote in the memo about the proposed return to office. "As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together. With that in mind, we’re updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office." The Verge report that some teams at Microsoft might be expected to work from the office four or five days a week, and that some roles like consulting will be exempt.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to read that the RTO mandate reflects the company's wider plans for generative AI. Microsoft have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">shovelling billions of dollars into AI tech</a> over the course of this year, a move that definitely doesn't have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/23/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst-and-send-the-stock-market-into-freefall">the potential to end terribly</a> pretty soon. Back in July, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">spoke of the need</a> for a "messy" organisational transformation to carry out Microsoft's aims for genAI, while talking around the "incongruence" between the company's vast profits and mass layoffs.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren cites some Microsoft staff he spoke to last month as having agreed that this return to office mandate could be seen as a form of 'soft' or 'stealth' layoffs. This is something companies instituting return to office mandates have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">accused of</a> for a number of years now, with the logic being that in rescinding the option of full-time remote work, these businesses are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandates-layoffs-quit-jobs-hybrid-remote-work-office-2025-5">making an effort to push certain staff towards leaving voluntarily</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you're a worker facing a lengthy commute, a move to a different place in order to be able to go into the office while maintaining a decent work/life balance, or have a disability/condition and aren't able to secure an exception, the word 'voluntarily' might be doing some heavy lifting there. Microsoft staff will reportedly be able to apply for an exception to this mandate by September 19th.</p>
<p>Clearly aiming to get out ahead of any accusations along those lines, Coleman wrote in her memo: "Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It’s about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers’ needs."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Communication Workers of America union, which have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">helped organise several of the unions that've been formed at game studios under the Microsoft/Xbox banner in recent years</a>, for comment.</p>
<p>The proposed first phase of Microsoft's proposed return to office mandate is set to only affect staff who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington. The second and third phases set to follow with "other US locations" and then staff outside the US further down the line.</p>
<p>Aside from the job cuts, Microsoft have also recently faced protests over their links to the Israeli government, something you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">read more about in this feature from Edwin</a>.</p>

            <p>
In my experience, there are two kinds of tank in Battlefield games. There are the ones driven by other people, which are cut from solid granite yet move like ballet dancers. And then there are the ones driven by me, which are made out of candy floss and handle like shopping trolleys. Possibly, this reflects some kind of underlying "skill issue", but come now, that's speculative reporting that flies in the face of logic. <em>Clearly</em> it's a balancing issue. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> lead producer David Sirland with a little more, based on learnings during the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games%22%22">shooter</a>'s multiplayer beta.
</p>
<p>
You may have found that the tanks, helicopters, jeeps and jets on show in said Battlefield 6 beta were somewhat squishy, versus the hardiness of infantry and especially, engineers equipped with anti-tank mines and rockets. Responding to an aggrieved Xitter post (as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-producer-acknowledges-vehicles-were-underpowered-in-the-beta-but-says-its-better-than-the-alternative-rather-have-too-weak-vehicles-over-too-powerful/">PCGamer</a>), Sirland acknowledged that there's a balancing issue here, but also, suggested that developers DICE, Ripple, Motive and Criterion may have lowballed the rides to begin with, in order to set a good foundation.
</p>
<p>
"That is a balance issue wholesale, not specific to this special situation however," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1965413764414718144">wrote</a>, when one user complained about the potency of said engineers and their dastardly munitions. "And one we are actively working on. Rather have too weak vehicles over too powerful to start. Its a tricky one as players get better at using them over time as well."
</p>
<p>
I find this both funny and interesting. Funny because Battlefield 6 has made a drinking game out of slaughtering vehicles in trailers: those choppers certainly don't seem fit for much besides blowing up. And interesting because it's a quick glimpse into the ever-gripping intricacies of game balancing.</p><p>There is arguably no such thing as "good balance" inasmuch as balancing is an on-going process - developers have to keep adjusting the mixture to keep up with the ingenuity and quirks of clashing groups of players, while hazily targeting some kind of optimal all-round experience. Sirland's aside has made me consider the prospect that developers might deliberately ship a game they consider 'unbalanced' because they're trying to anticipate how player behaviour might evolve. They're trying to balance for how people will be playing in a few month's time, perhaps. A fearful gamble, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Add these insights to EA's longer, official account of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">how they're changing Battlefield 6 based on the beta playtest</a>. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-persistent-servers-and-two-vehicle-heavy-maps-are-coming-in-the-next-labs-playtest">vehicle-heavy maps coming in future Battlefield Labs playtests</a>, so we can get another sense of the curiously variable sponginess of those tanks, which assuredly has nothing to do with the steadiness of my thumbs.</p>
<p>The final game will release on October 10th. The single player story sees the US army trying to save NATO from a rogue PMC, which I think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-make-the-usa-the-villain-in-the-next-call-of-duty-or-battlefield-game">a bit daft</a> given the current US administration's foreign policies.

            <p>
When was the last time you turned the radio on? I imagine for some of you younger readers, the answer is probably never. To be clear I'm not judging you here if that is the case, or even if it's just been a while, it's a format that feels hard to reckon with when its main point - listening to a range of pieces of music - is made borderline moot in the era of streaming services. All of which makes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/omega-point">Omega Point</a>, a game where you control a mech but the only thing you can do in it is change which radio station you're listening to, all the more interesting. <strong><em>A severe epilepsy warning is needed for this game as it has a lot of flashing images</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Omega Point is a new game from indie dev Cathroon, whose work you may have previously seen in <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/the-devil">The Devil</a>. A quick aside, if you haven't played The Devil, and you're desperate for a brutalist retro horror game, make sure you take a look at it alongside Omega Point. Speaking of, back to the point!
</p>
<p>
There is no protagonist in Omega Point, only you, the game starting with your body dissipating into nothingness, leaving you with no choice but to board your mech. This mech is the last surviving Doctrine, a machine that exists at "The Conjunction of Science and Religion." Once you're inside, you flick each individual switch to turn the metal giant on, eventually arriving at a timer and a message that says once it runs out, whoever is speaking will be here for you.
</p>
<p>
And after that? All you can do is explore a ruined world, and listen to the radio. There's rock tracks, chiptune, lo-fi beats, jungle, spoken word, looking at the credits there's at least upwards of 50 different songs to listen to.
</p><p>
With nothing else to do but listen to the radio, you do just that, and it makes this experience of watching the aforementioned timer count down feel a little bit less lonely. It's a curious little game that runs at just over 30 minutes (the timer itself is a full 30 minutes), so it's not a long experience, but it packs a lot to mull over in a short window.
</p>
<p>
There's that classic thing that many a mecha story does of what the pilot's relationship is to their mech in conjunction with feelings over the body. There's also the fact that even in such a desolate world, something as simple as the radio can still persist, each station sharing a small expression of itself for whoever happens upon it. A lot of big feelings for such a short run time!
</p>
<p>
A big recommendation from me for those in search of a short, punchy game that feels fitting for the times we live in. You can pick it up, for free I might add, on <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/omega-point">itch.io</a>.

Earlier this year, Bungie revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion that I can still only describe now as a head scratcher. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Renegades</a>, a Star Wars inspired expansion (quite literally as it's been made in collaboration with Lucasfilm) that was shown off properly for the first time in a livestream earlier today. Oh, and there's a release date for it too!
</p>
<p>
In terms of the meat and potatoes, actual Destiny portion of it, Renegades introduces the Lawless Frontier, a new co-op game mode that sees you taking on tough missions to build up reputation. Through this you can unlock new Renegade abilities like airstrikes, turrets, a bike. But like, a fancy sci-fi bike. There's also a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, which is directly inspired by Mos Eisley Cantina, which you can see pretty easily just by looking at it.

<p>
It's a weird thing to look at. There are some of the hallmarks of a "Star War" like that not-AT-ST-Walker. Some of the guns make that classic pew pew sound effect that's been etched into the minds of every person that's ever watched a Star Wars movie. Of course there's lightsabers too, mixed with Destiny enemies that sort of look like they could be from Star Wars but not so much that they feel horrendously awkward. It's like Bungie spritzed some perfume and waited too long before they walked into it - the scent is there, but it feels like it was a bit pointless.
</p><p>
I am eternally sceptical of live service games at the best of times, and with this, even as an outsider to Destiny 2, I'm just not sure it'll do what I presume Bungie hope it will. In any case, Destiny 2: Renegades is out December 2nd, so you've not got all that long to find out if it's any good or not.
