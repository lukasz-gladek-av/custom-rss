            <p>As someone of a nervous disposition, I am not a fan of the Shredder, one of the latest enemies added to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. First appearing after November's North Line update, these floating bollards buzz about the halls and corridors of the mountainside facility, Stella Montis. Cross their path and they emit a mechanical shriek before releasing an explosive wave of shrapnel. Anyone caught in the blast is cut to shribbons.</p>
<p>Currently, like a Dalek left at the top of a staircase, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> haven't found a way down the mountain and out into the world. So, if I want to avoid being screamed at and eviscerated by a hovering cigar tube, I can just avoid the hilltop base. According to Arc Raiders' design lead, that relative safety may not last much longer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"They'll figure out how to get out of there eventually," Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">Gamesradar in a recent interview</a>. Promising that Shredders will start popping up in Arc Raiders other maps.</p>
<p>I do wonder if Shredders will have the same hold over me on other maps. Despite several large halls, Stella Montis is a claustrophobic map, largely made up of winding corridors. When you come across a Shredder, you are trapped inside with it and its cloud of shrapnel is an all-encompassing threat. Arc Raiders other maps are a mix of interior and exterior, and you are rarely far from an open space to flee to.</p><p>Obviously, this will all come down to placement. A Shredder mooching about in Dam Battleground's swamps won't offer much of a threat, but if you were to come across one on the platform of the train stations in Buried City, waiting to mulch you when you are moments away from safety… Well, that could be a different story.</p>
<p>In this way, a Shredder could become a much more deadly indoor threat than Pops and Fireballs, the ball-shaped robots that bomb around inside buildings. While a Pop's self-destruct and a Freiballs flamethrower can cause significant damage, they aren't as well armoured as a Shredder, nor able to put out quite as much damage.</p>
<p>Where Shredder's appearing on other maps may be extra threatening, is when they can act in tandem with exterior enemies. A Shredder can be an effective area denial tool for the Arc, pushing you to remain outdoors where a Bombardier has you in its sights. The quickest way out of danger when the artillery mech is attacking you is to seek shelter indoors. Working together, Shredders and Bombardiers could be deeply frustrating.</p>
<p>Watkins didn't say when Shredders would start cropping up in other maps, so you still have time to fill your inventory with heavy shields.</p>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which provides VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">hit with a takedown request by CD Projekt</a>, its creator has now said that they've not ruled out the possibility of releasing it for free. However, they've painted that as an unlikely road to go down, arguing that it's "kind of become a moot point" due to piracy of their work following the strike.</p>
<p>The fact Luke Ross' R.E.A.L VR mod for Cyberpunk, which is one arm of a wider VR support framework for a wide range of games, was behind a paywall appeared to be the crux of CD Projekt's decision to strike it. The studio's business development vice president Jan Rosner claimed in a post that they offered Ross the option of making it free and switching the paywall for optional donations, in line with their <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">guidelines for fan-made content</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">IGN</a>, Ross has now offered a bit more of their side of the story. According to the modder, they had "absolutely no say" in pulling the Cyberpunk VR mod from Patreon, instead claiming the platform yanked it down automatically in response to the strike being filed. Ross said he reached out to CD Projekt to try and "negotiate" with the studio about the takedown, to which he alleges CD Projekt simply replied telling him he needed to comply with their terms of service.</p>
<p>There was "no negotiation, no comments on my proposals, no interest for instance in knowing how many of their users would be affected by the sudden removal," according to the modder. Interestingly, Ross also claims to have reached out to CD Projekt back in 2022 to ask if the Cyberpunk developers would be interested in turning the mod into an official VR port for the game, an offer the studio declined according to the modder.</p>
<p>I've reached out to CD Projekt for comment.</p>
<p>As for the situation as it stands, Ross told IGN he's not ruled out releasing the mod for free, but "it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task". The modder also cited the potential for such a move not being popular with people who've already paid to support their work on the R.E.A.L VR framework.</p><p>"Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point," Ross continued. "Because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's terms of service, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen."</p>
<p>For now, it seems Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod is set to remain taken down, and we'll have to see whether in the wake of alleged piracy and a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">visible number of negative comments</a> directed at the modder, they decide to change that further down the line.</p>
