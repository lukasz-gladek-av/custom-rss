            <p>When you were making plant pots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> and selling them to other players, you might not have thought you were laying the groundwork for a UK legal precedent that would define in-game gold as intangible property covered by the Theft Act 1968, but, well, here we are.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Popplewell has ruled on appeal that RuneScape's gold pieces are legal property, which is important for the ex-Jagex developer accused of stealing 705 billion of them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the judgement handed down by <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4#end-of-document">the Court of Appeal</a>, while working as a content developer at Jagex, the developer Andrew Lakeman is accused of accessing 68 different players accounts and "stripp[ing] those accounts of hundreds of billions of gold pieces" worth £543,123 if converted into RuneScape bonds, an item that can be bought for gold and exchanged for game membership. Jagex alleges this all took place in 2018. Lakeman and his solicitor dispute the charges.</p>
<p>When the case first went to trial last year, however, the judge dismissed the case agreeing with the defence's argument that RuneScape's in-game gold couldn't be legally defined as property under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents">Theft Act 1968</a>.</p>
<p>While the law does exclude certain items from being considered property, such as wild mushrooms and animals, it doesn't, oddly enough, list in-game currencies. However, to be considered a legally stealable item, something also has to be "rivalrous" and not "pure information". Meaning, as quoted within the case report: "if the use or consumption of the thing by a person, or of a specific group of persons, necessarily prejudices the use or consumption of that thing by one or more other persons.”</p><p>The judge ruled in favour of the defence because Runescape's in-game gold isn't "rivalrous", because if one player has gold, it doesn't take away another player's ability to get it. “Gold pieces within [Runescape] are not sufficiently rivalrous to be classed as intangible property," the judge said. "One gold piece is the same as any other, and their supply is infinite. The fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth, without taking it from existing players. This means, in my judgment, that even if the Crown is able to prove every single factual assertion that forms the basis of its case, the offences currently charged are not made out in law and I would not be prepared to leave them to a jury.”</p>
<p>However, the judge left their ruling open to appeal and appeal the prosecution bloody well have. The ruling went to the Court of Appeals, and ended up in front of Lord Justice Popplewell. Hold onto your legal pads, reader.</p>
<p>"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Popplewell writes. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite'. This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p>
<p>Effectively, just because each gold piece in RuneScape is identical and functionally the same, does not make it something that a player can be deprived of.</p>
<p>"The Judge’s second reason was that '[t]he fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth without taking it from existing players'," Popplwell continues. "However this too is no answer to the rivalrousness of the in-game wealth which a particular player already has at any given time. It focuses only on different assets which may thereafter be acquired."</p>
<p>After all, if you had had 100 million gold taken from you and someone said, 'Don't worry, at least it won't stop other players from earning gold', you might say that doesn't make a jot of difference to you.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Popplewell lays out their reasons for granting the prosecution's appeal, saying that RuneScape's gold pieces "are properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language. They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge': functionally they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen. On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p>While you may not want to read the whole case document, as it is a pretty extensive read, it is full of interesting examples of other legal precedents. For instance, there was the Oxford student accused of theft for taking an exam paper, even though they returned it, because they now possessed the questions that were in the document. Or the discussion that compares forbidden real money transfers in games to theft of Class A drugs.</p>
<p>With the Court of Appeal's decision now handed down, it would appear that the original case can now proceed.</p>

Today I became aware of Bolt Action, a historical strategy sim based on the World War II tabletop miniatures game from Warlord Games (founded by erstwhile Games Workshop staffers John Stallard and Paul Sawyer). It sees you fretting over questions of morale, line-of-sight and cover, while leading US, British or German armies across maps that range from beaches to churchyards. There’s multiplayer, too. Trailer ho!

In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3856030/view/541128612120628420?l=english">a blogpost this week</a>, developers Frag Games simultaneously announce their desire to do right by the source material while making clear that they don’t want to just transplant it, Victoria Crosses and all.  “We’ve all seen ‘PC adaptations’ that strip the soul out of a tabletop game to make it ‘accessible,’" they sneer, like grown men disproving the existence of Santa Claus. “So our designers spent weeks in ‘boot camp’: reading rulebooks, painting minis, rolling dice, measuring distances with tape, and feeling the genuine panic of a FUBAR roll.
</p>
<p>
“We learned a lot, and we’re still learning,” it continues. “But the one thing we DID know from the beginning was that we didn’t want to build a digital version of Bolt Action.  Bolt Action already exists! Playing a table-top experience will always remain special. What we want is the best Turn-Based Tactics videogame built on the Bolt Action ruleset.”</p>
<p>There follows a breakdown of the “six tactical choices” that await you whenever you pick a unit: firing, advancing, running, ambushing (aka overwatch), rallying (aka getting rid of suppression “pins”), and going prone. 
</p>
<p>
Another section explores vehicles, which are proof against small arms and have a selection of armour facings. There’s a bit on how indirect fire works, with the accuracy of consecutive shots on a target improving each turn, and a bit on platoon experience levels, upgrades and customisation.
</p><p>
It looks like a tidy little wargame – no release date yet - but that’s not why I’ve written it up. “We’re building a game for the person with five unpainted armies sitting on their shelf, but also for the strategy fan who wants a WWII game with complex rules and deep gameplay,” the devs comment near the end of that blogpost.</p>
<p>The mention of unpainted armies fills my heart with decades-old guilt – alas, Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth, I never did get round to finishing your cape – but also, <em>possibility</em>. Adaptations of tabletop miniatures games often come with elaborate livery editors, but now that I reflect, I’m not sure I’ve played one that lets you show up to the brawl with an unpainted force.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a while since I wielded a physical range ruler, but there is surely no better way to demonstrate your contempt for an opponent - and maybe, throw them off - than by rocking up with some High Elves you couldn’t be bothered to basecoat, let alone shade and layer. Imagine if Henry V came to Agincourt with no pants. How might the French have reacted? Clarification: I have not researched the Battle of Agincourt, so apologies if going commando was, in fact, a critical element of the English strategy. 
</p>
<p>
Less abrasively, I just think miniatures adaptations could do a better job of reflecting the fact that a lot of miniatures collectors aren’t great painters, however enthusiastic. There should be an editor function that recreates the effect of a spirited 10-year-old getting Warhammer for Xmas and trying to pimp out a whole Lizardman battalion in felt tip. I think this could be wholesome? Authentic, even?

Against the overbearing weight of modernity, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> continues to complete a Sisyphean task of simply existing two and a half decades after it originally launched. It just celebrated that 25th anniversary at the start of the year in fact, and now during a Winter Summit a slew of updates coming to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> were shown off in a roadmap from developer Jagex.
</p>
<p>
Kicking things off on the roadmap is Deadman: Annihilation, a "high intensity, PvP everywhere" variation on its main PvP mode that'll run from January 30th through to February 21st. This one'll feature some new sigils and breaches, and you can earn points to pick up cosmetics. Following that, in April Leagues is returning with Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts, complete with bonus XP drops and loot boosts, alongside some reimagined combat masteries.

Sailing, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/old-school-runescape-is-getting-its-first-new-skill-since-it-launched-and-so-the-xp-grind-begins-anew">first new skill since it changed from regular RuneScape to Old School RuneScape</a>, will be expanded upon sometime in 2026 too, namely new quests to do. Those of you that have been around for a long time will be interested to hear about the Blood Moon Rises update coming in the summer, a Grandmaster-tier quest that'll wrap up a story started all the way back in 2004. Jeepers creepers! Pull out the champagne for that questline. On top of all that, there's also The Fractured Archive, the game's first new raid in four years.
</p>
<p>
As always I'm just impressed this thing is trucking. It's the first online anything where I had an actual username (no I'm not telling you, some things are best kept as secrets), those types of internet histories are typically lost to time. Kudos!

            <p>A group of modders wearing the finest reverse-engineering goggles has managed to port birdly and beary platformer Banjo-Kazooie to PC, with a bunch of extra bells and whistles to make sure it won't make for a disappointing dip back into your childhood or adulthood. Their creation's dubbed Banjo: Recompiled, and it dropped over the weekend.</p>

<p>This recompiled version of the N64 classic, brought to life using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>, is primarily the work of modder Wiseguy. It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, provided you bring along the game files via a legally-sourced ROM of the North American 1.0 version.</p>
<p>If you do, you're in for a version of Banjo which offers a bunch of helpful features designed to ensure it's ideal to play on today's hardware, though it is also promised to run on more potato-shaped boxes. There's support for high framerates if you don't fancy leaving it at a solid 60, widescreen and ultrawide modes, and rapid loading times. A dual-analog camera steup, the ability to keep your notes if you die or exit a level, and support for playing on Steam Deck are also part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Finally, there's built-in mod support in case you want to get Doom running in the jigsaw minigame. Or just download the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLzv0U3cFlo">Jiggies of Time</a> and or a revamped texture pack.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a project that looks well worth the wait of eons for Banjo to get a proper PC port, something Microsoft haven't yet deigned worth digging back into the nostalgia toybox to whip out.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving Banjo: Recompiled a go, you'll find it and its souce code on <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GitHub</a>, where Wiseguy also notes they're planning on delivering ray tracing to it at some point down the line.</p>
