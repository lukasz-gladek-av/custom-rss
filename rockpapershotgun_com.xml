<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> developers Aggro Crab have taken issue with an imitation of their game created in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">100% non-problematic</a> kiddy funhouse sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, saying that they'd prefer people pirate their creation than play its predatory WonkoVision double.

</p><!--more-->
<p>

"tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff," reads <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">the social media post in question</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Roblox imitation is called Cliff, and is the work of PewStudio, who do acknowledge Peak as an inspiration on the store page, with the nonchalance of cereal manufacturers letting you know that your breakfast may contain a non-zero quantity of paperclips. As explored by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">Eurogamer</a>, everything from the title art through the lobby area to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">the co-op clambering mechanics</a> is flagrantly redolent of the Aggro Crab hit. The major difference is that it looks relatively naff and is thickly garnished with microtransactions.
</p>
<p>
I can understand Aggro Crab's ire, though I do enjoy the vague deference of naming the clone for a geological formation you'd expect to find lower down the mountainside. I mean, they could have called it Summit. I also have a guilty affection for the uncanny aesthetics of such cash-grab knock-offs. I always drink plenty of... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovfM7dvFto0">malk</a>?
</p>
<p>
Roblox teems with clones. If you have made a successful video game, its ruined double doubtless exists somewhere in the Roblands. For some developers this is a serious barrier to prosperity, and for others, it is an irritation. Peak has sold over <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/how-peak-sold-45m-copies-in-less">4.5 million copies</a> as of July - I can't imagine either Roblox clones or cathartic/vengeful piracy will make much difference to Aggro Crab's finances at this stage. If you're a Peak player, by the way, you might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players">these skeletons</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s warp pack sounded like great fun as soon as it was announced as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">last month's Control Group warbond</a>, and it's warped its way into many players' hearts. This is thanks in part to some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m9oto2/why_the_warp_pack_is_stier_and_plus_some_cool/">cool tricks</a> and glitches you can use it to pull off, with the game's latest patch having seen Arrowhead opt to outlaw the cheekiest of these.</p>
<p>You see, for the uninitiated, each mission in the shooter kicks off with you descending onto a planet and therefore ends with you being extracted via shuttle back up to your ship. It's the circle of Helldiver life and it moves us all. Well aside from folks who'd taken to using a well-timed warp to escape their ride home as it took off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, as you can see below, it's not as if this would leave perpetrators facing the consequences they should have. Instead of being marooned forever near the likes of Crimsican city Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch two (yes, that's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m6s4uq/if_you_thought_gun_was_a_silly_mega_city_name/">real location in Helldivers 2</a>, and yes, it's named after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxO0UdpoxM">infamous Welsh town</a>), the mission just ends as normal and you're magically beamed up, Scotty.</p>
<p>Enter patch 01.003.202, the full notes for which you canm find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516342955916658905?l=english">here</a>. "Disabled LIFT-182 warp pack fields around shuttles, preventing any Helldiver escapees," reads one of those notes. "You are done, it is time to go home." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi480s/well_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/">Awwwwwwwww</a>, say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi4b5t/this_has_got_to_be_the_best_thing_ah_has_added_to/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi50yw/patch_01003202/">players</a>, and I'd join in if pulling off the glitch didn't come with any potential to muck things up for other players.

</span></p><p>Outside of that, the patch is mostly minor bug fixes and tweaks, with a lot sticking to the theme of ensuring stuff from the Control Group warbond works as planned. For example, Arrowhead have decreased the Epoch plasma cannon's spread by 75% in an effort to improve its accuracy, made sure the laser sentry displays heat build up properly, and a couple of less flashy corrections to the warp pack on top of the extraction one.</p>
<p>There's also a fix for the manic laughter emote not triggering sound when done on a ship, because in space people apparently should be able to hear you creepily giggling.</p>
<p>That's it for now, but with players keen for a lot more fixes amid what's understandably been a relatively quiet summer for Arrowhead, studio CEO Shams Jorjani's suggested via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1402298082757971968">the game's Discord</a> that they're writing up a blog post that'll outline how they're prioritising which bugs get fixed first. The exec says there's "a very complex answer", so hopefully that rubric'll help the two sides of the coin be on the same page, especially since communication <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-arrowhead-addresses-escalation-of-freedom-update-backlash-60-day-plan">hasn't always been Arrowhead's strong suit</a> over the past year and a bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-patch-puts-a-stop-to-the-warp-packs-cheekiest-party-trick-because-you-are-done-it-is-time-to-go-home]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A brace of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> reporting has treated us to the first details of the game's combat system. Here are the headlines: counter attacks, weapon degradation and an energy bar that lets you perform power moves and dodge in slow motion. It's apparently reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> in that you have a stamina system and the dodge and counter timing can be tricky - a summary I would say also describes Punch-Out! from 1984, if I wanted to be a snarky little shitlord. There are no guns, just melee weapons that range from scavenged baseball bats to naginata polearms, looted from a spirit world of shrines and masked figures. </p><!--more-->
<p>Lob a naginata into an online gaming forum roundabouts now, and there's a one in six chance you'll seriously injure somebody who's miffed about all this. It's possible, mind, that they are miffed because some previewer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">innocently suggested that Soulslikes might be an influence</a> (the devs haven't spelled this out, as far as I know) and this fleeting observation has been internet-telephoned into the argument that Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> with schoolgirls. But also, they will be miffed because resenting Silent Hill's combat is integral to enjoying Silent Hill. It is the Silent Hillite's most treasured pastime.</p>
<p>I've held forth in the past about why the series absolutely doesn't need a combat system, and why any and all efforts to "improve" it with more complex mechanics are akin to putting wing mirrors on Pyramid Head. Lately, though, I've found peace in the idea that Silent Hill needing a combat system is Silent Hill's original curse. That need will always haunt the town's hospitals and schools - the ghost of a 'real' action game, tethered to this plane by the whims of commerce, trying to make sense of itself in a story about unschooled protagonists and squishy manifestations of self-loathing, doomed forever to be an uncertain mixture of pretty bad or fine but out-of-place.</p>
<p>It's not like Silent Hill f developers Neobards are breaking terrifying new ground for the series: Silent Hill 4 had weapon degradation already. The strangest aspect of the combat is a special move gauge that's tethered, Amnesia-style, to your character's mental wellbeing. The more spooked she is, the less slow-mo power attack juice she'll have at her disposal. This could be either a bruisingly artificial or clever way of raising the stakes during boss battles. Anyway, I remain more fascinated by the setting and story, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">read about here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine]]></content:encoded>
