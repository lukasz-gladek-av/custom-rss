            <p>
Despite having received a plethora of updates, bits of DLC, and expansion packs over the course of the past 11 years, there are still things that featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 3 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is yet to receive. Seriously, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has been supported for twice the length of time The Sims 3 was, and yet it's only this year that it's getting a pack that features fairies. They'll be coming in the just announced Enchanted by Nature pack, which includes a bit more than just a new supernatural designation for your Sims.

<p>
The biggest thing is the fairies though, so let's start with that. Thanks to literal Mother Nature, you'll be able to turn any of your Sims into fairies, with a couple of different paths laid out before them. You can either turn them into a Harmonious Fairy, a "benevolent winged helper who wants to aide other living things find health and balance," or a Discordant Fairy, a "flying mischief-maker that enjoys stirring up a little chaos and making everyday life harder for the Sims around them."

Fairies also come with some unique abilities like being able to nurture plants or change other Sims' moods. Sounds a bit manipulative if you ask me, but The Sims is all about the drama really isn't it? You can customise the fairy version of your Sims too, from wings, to ears, to glowing tattoos and beyond. I'd also like to point out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/maxis">Maxis</a> shared fairies can "even use their Fairy charm to deliver a special WooHoo!" They somewhat know their audience, at least.
</p>
<p>
There's a new area coming with this expansion too, Innisgreen, which looks like something out of the dreams of a 2020-era cottagecore TikToker. This one's made up of three neighbourhoods, a seaside village, a towny sort of area with shops and houses to live in, and a magical forest. There's a bevy of whimsical looking items to build up new homes with too.
</p>
<p>
It seems that your Sims can also get imbalanced when they lose control of their life a bit, which can make them learn skills a bit slower than normal. This can lead to ailments, which actually have both pros and cons, but you can fix these by making cures and elixirs on the new apothecary table. You can read all of this in more detail over in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/enchanted-by-nature-expansion-pack">blog post from EA</a>.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and you've not got long to wait for this one either, as it's currently due out next month, July 10th.
