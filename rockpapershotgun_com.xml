I found the opening 15 minutes of EvoCreo’s demo to be a laugh riot, mostly because I accidentally named my character “Help”, not “Helen”. This lent a certain urgency to all the routine scene-setting and tutorial dialogue. Help, Farmer Whatshisname is looking for you! Help, I’m adding a map feature to your tablet! Help, there are over 170 Creos to discover! Given that RPGs can be sluggish at first, I think I’m going to adopt this as standard practice going forward. Nothing gets you over the opening hump like the impression that everybody you speak to has just escaped from a burning house.

Already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-pathologic-3-a-fresh-pokemon-rival-a-mind-bending-fps-and-some-crablike-base-building">fed to the Maw</a>, and available on Steam today, EvoCreo is a PC port of a popular creature collecting mobile game from 10 years ago. Based on the little time I’ve spent as a budding <del>Pokémon Trainer</del> Creo Evoker it feels like derivative but entertaining genre fare, transplanted to desktops with minimal ceremony.

According to developer rioneye, posting on the Steam forums, the new PC version won’t feature an in-game shop, and will include some of the mobile version’s separately sold DLC and premium items, though I’m not clear on final pricing. The demo’s 2D anime visuals and big-buttoned interface feel like a straight lift from the mobile game, but the presentation and controls have apparently been improved for the full Steam release. I think if you’re really into this kind of thing, the sense of playing an emulated version won’t bother you much, but this isn't exactly a posh remaster project.
</p><p>
It hits many of the beats you’re likely expecting. Taming monsters during open exploration. Arena fights. Evolutionary paths. Scraps with elite tamers. The devs seem especially proud of the combat system, which they say is about “more than matching types”, in a gentle jab at older instalments of Nintendo’s monster-taming series. “Manage move cooldowns, status effects, and powerful passive traits in deep, turn-based battles that reward smart team building and tactical thinking,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">the Steam page explains</a>. There's a longer primordial account of the differences on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1727119297/evocreotm-a-monster-collection-rpg/description">the original 2013 Kickstarter</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can expect online PvP at some point after release. Maybe give the demo a shot, while it’s live? And let me know if you think of any amusing character names. I guess “Argh” or “Achoo!” would kindle a similar mood.

            <p>Right, get ready for some chatter about where the contents of our collective wallets have gone over the past year. Valve's list of the highest-grossing games on Steam in 2025 has emerged from the great mists, and in a nice revelation, features a larger number of fresh releases than last year's ranking. That's alongside all of the moderately to quite old stuff which more folks keep hopping on the train of with every passing 12 month period. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">data</a>'s been dissected, shared, and otherwise <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18eg0P-P-swZ8v6kWyA4XkJpIEhr7UZospSWqJMEmDK4/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadsheeted</a> by <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">GameDiscoverCo</a> in their latest newsletter. The big news is that of the top 100 highest grossers, 31 were new games - that meaning games released in 2025 or 2024 in this case. Fresh games made up 24 of the 100 spots in last year's version of this ranking, so things have trended marginally newer.</p>
<p>"It’s possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games," GameDiscoverCo boffin Simon Carless wrote of potential explanations for this shift. "It’s also possible that with more and more ‘catalog games’ being sold cheaply on discount, sorting by revenue will favour $60 newcomers &amp; viral hits (vs. games at 25-50% of the price that still do good ‘long tail’.) It’s probably...a combo of these things?"</p>
<p>As for the new games which made the cut, Valve split these rankings into four tiers of moneyness - platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Platinum's the top ranking, with seven of its 12 this year meeting the new game requirements. Those were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>, plus viral hits Schedule 1 and REPO. There's also Call of Duty, which technically counts as new thanks to Activision's switch to dishing out its latest shootering via an app. The remaining four platinumers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, all of which have shot their way to defending the honour of the non-brand new games.</p><p>Moving down to gold tier, you find newbies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>. They're hanging out with a number of other well-established big hitters - your Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> are also in that club, proving their staying power. The tier below that, silver is home to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, while Hades 2's nestled in bronze. Taking a glance at the list of most played Steam Deck games, both Silksong and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> have vaulted straight into the platinum section this year.</p>
<p>As Carless eludes to, pinning down exactly what's caused this year's shifts is complicated, but the wider trend at least appears to suggest the continued strangulation of folks' ability to spend on new games without worrying they might suddenly need that money because they've been laid off isn't pushing things even more starkly away from newer games which're usually more pricey than their older brethren.</p>
<p>Then again, the fact Steam's free of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - two perennial stalwarts of lists like these for other platforms - is probably helping make that sunny assessment easier to reach.</p>
