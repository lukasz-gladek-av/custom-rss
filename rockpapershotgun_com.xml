            <p>
The next major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> update will make some fairly sizeable tweaks to Firaxis' latest and not, so far, greatest 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim. It'll rearrange the workings of age transitions, with a view to providing a bit more continuity between epochs and helping you finish your to-do list before crossing the threshold. We can expect a new commander, too - Trưng Nhị, sister to existing Vietnamese leader Trưng Trắc. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most significantly, the feature will re-introduce auto-explore mechanics for scouts. This piques my interest, inasmuch as I haven't ever thought critically about auto-explore mechanics, and now that I do, I realise I regard them with a mixture of enthusiasm and spite.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In theory, auto-explore is a boon for any 4X, because 4Xs have big maps and it's a faff to blow away all that fog of war yourself. When playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, especially, I consider my reconnaissance vessels the pick of the flock. In practice, however, I sometimes actually lose more time and attention to auto-explore mechanics, because when I said "explore at random", I did not mean over <em>there</em>, you wally. Obviously you wouldn't begin by heading east: the terrain tiles are far more abundant in POIs over thisaway. Also, don't move too far away because you're a military unit, and I might you need to bonk a bandit camp or escort a settler or something. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a>, in which Civs don't have as many units to play with, I am always triggering auto-explore for a couple of turns, then taking my hero's wrist in vexation when they mope off towards the least promising coastline. I am that terrible faux-delegator who complains of too much work but also won't trust anybody else with the details.
</p>
<p>
I imagine 4X unit designers have spent a lot of time working out how to guesstimate the player's intentions and ensure that the auto-exploration feels sensible. Be ye dev or little people, I welcome your own thoughts on the subject. Introducing some more heavy-handed context-sensitivity helps, in my experience: in Civ 7, auto-exploring scouts will "[prioritize] tile reveals while automatically stopping in range of Discoveries and enemy zones of control".
</p>
<p>
As for the ever-vexatious question of Ages, you'll now get a 10-turn countdown before each Age transition, so you can polish off your objectives. There's also a continuity setting that preserves unit positions, and you can expect leadership relationships to "evolve more smoothly" between ages. The full patch notes will land alongside the update itself, sometime next week.
</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">troubled launch showing</a>, Civilization 7 is... still getting is arse kicked on Steam, with a mostly negative user review consensus ranging from people who played 0.4 hours before noticing the invasive kernel-based anti-cheat, to people who've played 2000 hours and come to the conclusion that they should not have. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">The last big update</a> brought some very big maps, together with Steam Workshop support.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You already knew hectic 1v1 bullet sprayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> was going to add 2v2 matches and a four-player free-for-all mode. You knew because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutalist-shooter-straftat-teases-a-four-player-free-for-all-mode">I told you months ago</a>. Don't pretend you forgot. Please, it's insulting. Anyway, the update that adds these modes arrived yesterday and it also adds - surprise! - a ton of new maps. Which brings the game's total number of killing arenas to over 300. Straft THAT, other shooters. </p>

<p>"We're happy to launch today the official 4 Players Straftat update FOR FREE," yell developers Lemaitre Bros in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/497201025048904106?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>, probably in an effort to be heard over the sound of gunfire. "It includes both 2v2 and Free For All (1v1v1v1). Team matches can be 1v2 and 1v3 as well. This was by far the most requested feature for the game since release back in October. We hope these new gamemodes will meet your expectations."</p>
<p>I just played a bunch of matches and I left smiling as widely as ever. Having a rando teammate to carry my carpal tunnelled corpse through each burst of low-stakes, quickfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> murder certainly helped. The free-for-all matches were just as snappy, and there is a familiar glee in avoiding a straight fight and stealing that last kill with a snipey shot from across the map to win the game. God, it's wild that video games can just be good, you know? YOU CAN PLAY THIS FOR FREE.</p>
<p>The update also adds a heap of new maps, a practice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">the developers continue</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">a frequency</a> that would drive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-map-makers-map-more-maps-into-straftat">a man to madness</a>. There are ten new free maps, plus an extra 28 maps for DLC owners. Although note that even matching up with someone else who owns the DLC will let you play the maps you don't have. There are some new weapons too, the devs say, including a "Curved Knife" which boosts jumping, and a couple of fast-firing but low-damage machine guns.</p>
<p>I've only devoted a few hours to this shooter, yet I can't help but recommend it. It is pure, old-school adrenaline administration software. You bumslide and wall run and miss nine out of ten shots in a wild panic when your foe appears around the corner. You can lose and lose and lose, and never care, because a round lasts about 30-60 seconds and how can you get annoyed about ragdolling across the map when you're already shooting rockets again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-shooter-straftat-gets-a-2v2-update-and-if-my-maths-are-correct-this-makes-it-twice-as-intense-1v1]]></content:encoded>
