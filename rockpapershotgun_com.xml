            <p>The last patch is never the last patch. CD Projekt have been teaching us that lesson for about a year with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is the latest game to have its devs go 'no, wait, one more'. To be fair to Supergiant, they did specify that the roguelike's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld">previous update would "likely" be the last one</a> before full release.</p>
<p>It wasn't. An eleventh early access patch has hit the underworld, but the devs swear it'll be the last one for realsies this time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512964244473382774?l=english">notes for patch 11</a>, there's still no release date for Hades 2's full launch, but Supergiant are clearly full steam ahead in their dungeon run towards that goal. The headline note in the patch is some direct prep, with the devs reminding folks that when the game's "True Ending" is deployed, any crafting materials like zodiac sand or void lenses you've collected will be converted to prestige automatically when you first load up your save in 1.0.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch more changes to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms' abilities and aspects, with the Umbral Flames, Moonstone Axe, and Black Coat all receiving nice buffs. As usual, those tweaks are accompanied by a bunch of fiddling with boons, blessings, and Daedalus hammer upgrades.</p>
<p>Hexes'll now be quicker to cast and I'm glad to report that Supgiant have buffed a cat. Well, Toula the wildcat, whom MelinoÃ« can recruit as a familiar in Erebus, but same difference. They're all furry, purry, and wouldn't really care that much if you died, yeah?</p>
<p>The devs have also dialled down the amount of enemies you'll face in any single wave while battling through Olympus, on the summit, or when running into Icarus. The former'll also have more places for you to take cover. There are tweaks to a bunch of common enemies, and Supergiant look to have done more tuning down than tuning up.</p>
<p>You can also no longer die in the time it takes Athena to rock up after she says she's on her way, which sounds handy in avoiding instances of goddesses saying 'Oh nuts, you alright there kiddo?'</p>
<p>Here's hoping we do get that full release date soon, since this (fingers crossed) does look to be the final Hades 2 patch before 1.0. Or maybe it'll just shadow-drop at 3AM on a random Tuesday. As Greek lad Socrates once said, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Say what you like about Valve, they make the trains run on time. Eventually. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> got a small surprise update yesterday which changed the speed of a train in the 2004 shooter's driving sequence (the level called "Highway 17"). This change will let you once again beat said train in a game of chicken that it has been winning against most players for nearly two decades.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Restored speed of the train near the end of Highway 17 to better match the original shipped difficulty," the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/220/announcements/detail/507335122931941415?snr=2___">somewhat belated patch notes read</a>, alongside a couple of other fixes. 

</p><p>The train in question approaches the player head-on during a tense moment in the dune buggy level, and you hear its whistle through the fog before you even see it coming. In the original release, you could easily boost on towards the train, and nip out of its way just in time, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pXGl-exT8o">you can see here</a>. </p>
<p>But when the driving physics were updated alongside the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-episode-two">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a> back in 2007, that feat became <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/220/discussions/0/4629232489537269257/">much, much harder</a> (though not impossible). The strategy then became <a href="https://youtu.be/HU6duSquajs?feature=shared&amp;t=3998">reversing and waiting until the train passed</a>. It's likely if you've only played the shooter since then, you'll think of this as the only way to progress. But now we know: you were always meant to beat that train. </p>

<p>There were a couple of other corrections to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. "Fixed missing collision that was allowing NPCs to shoot through some walls in Entanglement," the patch notes continue. "Fixed issue where Alyx could obstruct the player's path when boarding the teleporter near the end of Entanglement."</p>
<p>I don't know about wallhacking Combine soldiers, but the latter bug regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYlHX9-IxVY">a stubbornly unmoving Alyx</a> is not a long-standing bug, but a trickling hangover from Half-Life 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">big 20th anniversary re-jig</a> last year. While I like to imagine there is a lone caretaker employed solely to give the venerable manshoot laughably nitpicky tweaks and bugfixes long after its debut, it's more likely that these are just the last few tidy-up jobs following the anniversary update.</p>
<p>After all, it isn't the first time we've seen the game get re-tweaked because of its birthday makeover. We previously reported how one invisible wall in a sewer pipe was removed because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-added-an-invisible-wall-to-this-sewer-pipe-in-half-life-2-in-their-anniversary-update-but-it-only-annoyed-speedrunners">it annoyed speed runners</a>. I wonder how these latest fixes help or hinder such sprinters.</p>
<p>Still, it is fun to imagine that one dedicated person at Valve, whether they exist or not, who goes to work every day frustrated and disgusted at the missing collision walls of the tenth level in a shooter from 20 years ago, who daily boots up the Radiant level editor to fiddle with its Windows XP-era interface just to fix a problem few other souls care about. Godspeed the invisible Half-Life 2 caretaker.</p>
