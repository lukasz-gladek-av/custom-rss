            <p>
It took them long enough, but Sony and Guerilla have finally announced that other online Horizon game (the one that isn't an MMO), and it's called Horizon Hunters Gathering. On the offset it sort of looks like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter</a> clone gameplay wise, especially being a co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game, though there are some definite differences between the two.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty of differences with the main series too, the most obvious being that radical art style change. I'm certainly for it, the Horizon games admittedly have quite nice colours but ultimately have a forgettable art direction, whereas this one is clearly following in the 3D animation pseudo revolution that was Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. There's a hero shooter-esque quality to it, as you can only choose from pre-set characters as opposed to making your own a la Monster Hunter, all of which have a couple of classes to choose from themselves.

<p>
There's a guy with a big ole warhammer, another who's speedy as hell with a bow and arrow, a woman with a fancy looking spear, a fair amount of variety on display (those three will also be the only characters available to choose from in the game's first closed playtest, which you can only access through the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">PlayStation Beta Program</a>). The combat itself looks flashy and crunchy enough, and like in the original games you still have to find weak points on the robo dinos.
</p><p>
This first playtest will have a couple of mission types to try out, the first one being Machine Excursion, where you have to fight off a bunch of the machines and defend your home, collecting random power-ups along the way, so a touch roguelikey. There's also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-esque ring that closes in more and more to keep you on your toes. The other mission type is called Cauldron Descent, which sort of looks like a dungeon crawly, puzzley take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>, as you choose different rooms to go through as you progress.
</p>
<p>
There's also a Monster Hunter style hub area where you can upgrade equipment, or just hangout in a campsite that you can customise yourself. Overall it feels like a real mish mash of different games, and looks cohesive enough in its first trailer, though I do wonder if it's able to find its own identity amongst it all. In any case, no release date or even window in this one, so if you're interested, just have patience.

            <p>Get in cover and 10/4 your sit reps, soldier! Battalion developers Bulkhead have revealed a new military sandbox shooter set to arrive in early access at some point this year. It's called Wardogs and it'll see matches featuring up to 100 mercenaries mercilessly murder each other in teams, with the reward being a stack of money to spend on upping the ante with their next loadout.</p>

<p>Our first thought upon seeing the player count per session was that the thing seems quite Battlefieldy, but Bulkhead say that - at least in terms of the game's main mode - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-3">Arma 3</a> mod <a href="https://armakoth.com/">King of the Hill</a> was the main inspiration. For clarity that's a mod with three team sector control missions featuring lots of walkie-talkie enthusiasts rogering each other, not the TV show about a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA6EdFZD8s8">man with a very small bottom</a> and his son who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy3qk4ohwFA">doesn't know you, but knows that's his purse</a>.</p>
<p>So, each match'll see you flown out to Eastern Europe's famous derelict industrial mountains, assigned to one of three teams fighting for control of a randomised 2x2KM central control zone within a 256KM² map, and told to keep your bottom in the control zone until your squad rack up the 100 points needed to win.</p><p>Destructible environments designed to be shaped in fortified defence points, makeshift bases, or vicious deathtraps feed into the territorial struggles, and Bulkhead say tactical nous will be rewarded. In line with that, throughout each battle you earn cash through actions like "reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective", encouraging folks to work together.</p>
<p>The contents of your cute camo wallet persist between matches, and are what you use to buy different bits of the loadout you take into each fight. Which weapons, gear, utility bobbins and vehicles you pick will influence how the action plays out, with stuff like whipping out your big tank or chopper at the exact right time having the potential to turn the tide drastically.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like something the bit of my brain that quietly loves a bit of multiplayer shootering could dig, even if I'll spend 90% of the time being told off by teammates for being too much of a coward to poke my head out of cover and heal them.</p>
<p>Wardogs is set to release in early access at some point in 2026, with Bulkhead planning to have this last "around 12 to 18 months" while they work on "expanding content, improving systems, refining balance, and responding to player feedback". Until then, you can wishlist the shooter on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>
