            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I had totally forgotten that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> was in development alongside a new Resident Evil multiplayer game, which (at the risk of yet again inflating my own importance) is perhaps why Capcom have just shut the latter down. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evils-multiplayer-spin-off-reverse-is-shutting-down-later-this-year">promised earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-reverse">Resident Evil RE:Verse</a> is no more. Capcom have burned down the game’s storefront listing, taken a shovel to its DLC pages, and now put a pitchfork through the servers. Run tell the peasantfolk that the beast is finally dead.</p><!--more-->
<p>When they confirmed the suspension of support, Capcom said that they released Re:Verse back in 2022 to celebrate the original game's 25th anniversary. The game peaked at 2080 concurrent players on Steam, which is not exactly Counter-Strike numbers, but Capcom feel nonetheless that "Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably". Ah, this reminds me of me telling my mother that I had an intimidating persona when nobody showed up for my 16th birthday party.</p>
<p>RE:Verse was a six player third-person shooter featuring a cross-section of nods to older Resident Evils, including the ability to chug a potion and transform into a celebrity baddy such as Resident Evil 7’s chainshear-wielding scruffer Jack Baker. It was the latest in Capcom’s quixotic efforts to make a multiplayer Resi, a quest that has given us such wibbly fare as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city">Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</a>, which Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city">summarised</a> as “not so much bad as grindingly unenthusiastic”. </p>
<p>I’m not aware of an all-timer multiplayer Resident Evil game but they were getting there with the co-op features for games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a>, and Resident Evil Outbreak – a multiplayer survival game set in Raccoon City – should have been a doozie. In Capcom’s defence, they released that back in primordial 2003, when online was a novelty, and online Japanese games especially had you communicating with the servers by means of a specially trained seagull. I’ve still got my seagull from the dial-up days. He’s running a major publisher now. I won’t tell you which one, but let’s just say that the guano rolls downhill at Ubisoft Inc.</p>
<p>While RE:Verse is most assuredly dead - the fate of <a hef="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games that have online requirements</a>, according to one study - Capcom continue to chase the tipsy T-viral daydream of Resident Evil multiplayer. According to the most recent round of Resident Evil Requiem developer interviews, they <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/capcom-ditches-online-plans-for-resident-evil-requiem/ar-AA1HyiP1">toyed with</a> another online-focussed Resident Evil before moving ahead with Requiem’s premise of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">stuck in a hotel with a stampeding hag</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-finally-put-a-bullet-in-resident-evil-reverse-but-havent-entirely-given-up-on-resident-evil-online]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's happened. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">modding</a> is one step closer to 100% completion.</p>
<p>The 2025 game about a 2006 game that's undergone some serious plastic surgery has gotten its first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">mod</a> that adds in Star Wars' iconic fighty sticks, so you can pretend to be Suke Lkywalker, Yo Da, or the other ones.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder who's stepped up the plate and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4702?tab=description">added lightsabers</a> to Oblivin' on a prayer Remastered is CosmicBoogaloo. They've delivered five different colours of light-up sword, all with authentic 'vzzzzhhhh' and 'vwwwummm' sound effects.</p>
<p>There's red, green, blue, purple, and yellow. All I'll say is, if you join the Dark Brotherhood and use a red one, even Lucien Lachance might think you're a bit too edgy. You'll have to console command them into your inventory once you've downloaded the mod, which requires <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331">Runtime EditorIDs (Console)</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>. Think of it as just another force power that involves typing midichlorian-infused item IDs into your brain code.</p>

<p>CosmicBoogaloo's a modder whose stuff I've seen pretty regularly in my regular trips to Oblivion Remastered's Nexus Mods page. They've also recently added <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681">a gun</a> into the game, in case you'd prefer to roleplay as John McClane while you save Cyrodiil. I'll be honest, their mods which add <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4232">a literal tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4076">a brick</a> to OR as melee weapons are probably more up my alley.</p>
<p>I also feel like I have to mention that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3453?tab=description">one of their mods</a> saw them attempt to make the heads of every Oblivion Remastered character type invisible, and they apparently accidentally ended up rendering "pretty much EVERY normal NPC" in Cyrodiil headless. Happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's to take nothing away from their lightsaber achievement. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42462?tab=description">Every</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/26200">Elder</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92440">Scrolls</a> game needs a bunch of lightsaber mods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-inevitable-lightsaber-mod-made-by-someone-who-once-accidentally-decapitated-the-entire-population-of-cyrodiil]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Well, that was quick. Following rumours last week and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure">our own report just today</a>, 11 Bit Studios have confirmed that they made use of generative AI tools in sci-fi management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> for the translation and localisation of what they say is a very small amount of text. They've also revealed that they used AI-generated assets as placeholders during development, but "in a very limited manner".</p>
<p>11 Bit argue that all of this represents "a limited impact on your gaming experience", but concede that they should have fessed up about it regardless. For context, the game launched on PC with no mention of any AI-generated material, including on Steam, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">Valve requires developers to disclose such things</a>.
</p>

<p>
All this comes in the form of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i?ref_src=embed">a Bluesky post</a>. "AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner," it reads. "Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.
</p>
<p>
"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder," the post continues. "This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game."
</p>
<p>
You can find a screenshot of the asset in question below. 11 Bit say they have carried out a review of the game and "confirmed that this was an isolated case". The asset is now being updated.

<p>
The developers also confirm that The Alters has made use of AI translation or localisation. The game features parody licensed movies you can watch with your clones to boost their morale. These were externally produced, 11 Bit say, and required "last-minute" translations.</p>
<p>"Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch", the post goes on, while insisting that 11 Bit had always intended to have the relevant materials properly translated by agencies in the course of a localisation hotfix after release. The hotfix in question is now in development.
</p>
<p>
The developers conclude by noting that the external movies are "approx. 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text". The alternative to using genAI to create them, 11 Bit argue, was to release the dialogue exclusively in English. They didn't want to do this, but now "acknowledge this was the wrong call" and that "no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know". 
</p>
<p>I think the defence that the vast majority of The Alters was made the Old-Fashioned Way by tangible beings of flesh is fair enough. That said, I feel inclined to pass on <a href="https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle">Dordle</a> developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zaratustra.bsky.social/post/3lstkkc62ns26">Zaratustra</a>'s response to 11 Bit's statement: "If you feel 0.3% of the game's text is not a big deal to have generated with AI, which percentage would you draw the line at[?]"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner]]></content:encoded>
