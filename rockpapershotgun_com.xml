            <p>The development of 2020 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </a>cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a> (paywalled) in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a> creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.</p><!--more-->
<p>These are 2015’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">Black Ops 3</a> (“over $450 million”), 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Modern Warfare</a> (“over $640 million”), and the aforementioned Cold War. The filing also contained sales figures: Black Ops 3 has sold 43 million copies, Modern Warfare 41 million, and Cold War 30 million. These are specified by Kelly to be "development costs", so presumably don't include marketing, though there's no full breakdown.</p>
<p>There have been higher external estimates for ongoing development of a video game, notably <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/its-taken-4-years-and-roughly-dollar900-million-but-genshin-impact-is-a-better-open-world-rpg-than-ever-after-update-50/">Genshin Impact</a>, but this is by far the highest figure from an internal source. For comparison, Totilo points to court documents from 2023 which revealed $212 and $220 million budgets for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon: Forbidden West</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last Of Us Part 2</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The information, says Game File, is based on a declaration from Kelly filed to a court in California on 23rd December, and is part of Activision’s response to a lawsuit filed against the company last May regarding a 2022 school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The lawsuit against Activision also blames Facebook owner Meta, alleging that the two companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8449dxw23do">“knowingly exposed”</a> the shooter to the weapon he used.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ps5-xbox-series-switch-slump?open=false#%C2%A7item-uvalde-families-sue-activision-saying-call-of-duty-inspired-killer">reported by</a> Game File, Activision last year denied any connection between games and gun violence, while also expressing sympathy for the victims. In October of 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-gun-giant-remington-used-call-of-duty-to-promote-weapons-to-younger-players">previously undisclosed product placement</a> deal between Call Of Duty and rifle manufacturer Remington.</p>
<p>To return to the figures themselves: they’re absurd, yes. It's a shame we don't have a proper breakdown of the costs by development discipline. Is most of the money going toward tuning up the art and graphics? If so, it's worth noting that players nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-66-titles-saw-80-percent-of-all-playtime-in-2023-most-older-games-like-fortnite-or-gta-5">increasingly seem to favour reliable older titles with outdated visuals</a> over expensive spectacle. In any case, budgets this big have worrying implications for individual developers within the Microsoft/Activision empire, who are more likely to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">face layoffs</a> when costs increase and fail to be recouped.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a> speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. </p>

<p>Barbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player "GrayGooGlitch". It's only 11 seconds short of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/UFO_50/runs/yj9wdgnz">the fastest existing run</a>. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.</p>
<p>But the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.</p><p>Finally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ufo-50-review">UFO 50 review</a>, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner "SpootyBiscuit" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world-downpour">Rain World: Downpour</a>, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-this-years-big-speedrunning-fest-elden-ring-bosses-will-be-defeated-with-the-power-of-saxophone">beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone</a> and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider <em>slightly</em> hypocritical, given the character's visual design.</p>
<p>Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.</p><!--more-->

<p>I know about the Jimbo's Big Naturals mod because Graham, ever the mercurial wayfinder, posted it in our Slack yesterday. It's the work of artist, fanfic writer and "shitpost artisan" <a href="https://linktr.ee/prettypinkpansy">prettypinkpansy</a>, who came up with the idea while "trapped in bed with a migraine". Presumably delirious and raving, they rose from the sweat-soaked sheets, fired up Aseprite, and went to work. There were some mighty hurdles to overcome. "i cannot give titties to to-do list", <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leysd5upls2o">reads</a> one despairing Bluesky update. Some hours <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leyve36eyk2h">later</a>: "let it not be said i am unwilling to admit when i am wrong". The results can now be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/prettypinkpansy/jimbos-big-naturals">Github</a>. Here's some blurb from the creator:</p>
<blockquote>"Jimbo's Big Naturals is a simple edit of Balatro's existing assets to give the jokers boobs. It is not intended to be a "gender swap" mod, though you may view it as making the jokers ladies if that pleases you. It is just the existing jokers, but now they have boobs. I made it myself using Aseprite. It covers 122 of the 150 Jokers in Balatro. Other places where Joker imagery appears (such as wax seals, booster packs, and the Wraith spectral card) are also affected."</blockquote>
<p>To be absolutely clear, this ain't some pendulous waifu mod for the gamerz: it's, dare I say, tasteful, whatever that means, and very much safe for work, assuming you have the kind of workplace where people don't frown upon the spectacle of a busty walkie talkie.</p><p>"No nipples are onscreen," prettypinkpansy explains. "The closest thing to anything scandalous is that Half Joker has a bare chest, but it's torn too badly so that it obscures anything of note." If you don't want to install, you can always view the whole modded sprite sheet <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8b993577e5ede9ff3a9ccc99609bc64c2e36aa601d98850f636dca77f6248e71/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f666336386934432e706e67">here</a>. Given that prettypinkpansy doesn't specify exactly which cards have undergone Big Naturalisation, there's some innocent amusement to be had scrutinising seemingly boobless cards for subtle modifications.</p>
<p>I like Jimbo's Big Naturals. It's that magic kind of mod that is both very silly and surprisingly crafty. It's also a testament to the variety and imagination of Balatro's pixelart card designs: applying the same bodily adjustments to all of them has required a certain amount of imagination in turn. Yes, <em>that's</em> why I'm writing this up. Not because I'm almost 40 and still giggle at the idea of a banana with boobs. Some closing trivia: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34ffhn6s23">this</a> is the developer's favourite Big Naturals card, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34o2p5uc23">this</a> is the one that was hardest to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don’t want to talk to a game. I assume I’m not alone in this, because the tech’s been around for donkey’s and barely anyone tries to use it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> tried voice commands. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCOM_U.S._Navy_SEALs">Socom U.S Navy Seals </a>shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/jpbkhj/socom_us_navy_seals_voice_commands_for_ai/">wrote a Redditor</a> on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/">Steam page</a>. Here’s a trailer.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed by now, there’s a caveat to this seemingly boundless NPC reactivity - Meaning Machine are using what they call their ‘Game Conscious (tee-em) AI system’. "The advent of generative AI has the potential to kickstart a golden age of creative experimentation and innovation," they say. "But only if creative people remain at the helm."</p><p>Here is my drive-by reaction to this: if you don’t value the written word enough to have a writer create unique, intentional dialogue, then why make a game based around conversation? Same for actors - there’s an undeniable choppy tinge to the character’s voices you don’t get with a real human reading a whole line like they mean it. But then again, I’d be lying if I said Dead Meat felt devoid of personality. Its characters are certainly a far cry from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia AI NPC James</a> spoke to last year, and the dialogue they’ve shown off doesn’t give me any overt slop vibes (edit: actually, kinda.)</p>
<p>On the one hand, co-founder and tech lead Ben Ackland says he’s been working on AI for games for over six years "before it was cool", which you’d think might insulate them from some of the rabid gold-rush evangelism we’ve seen recently. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.meaningmachine.games/game-conscious-ai">their website</a> shows off a separate system called ‘battle banter’ by having it add AI battle barks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, which feels about as close to missing the point as you can get. Sparing dialogue and deliberately lonely encounters? I barely know ‘ers.</p>
<p>All I can really say is this: Dead Meat looks interesting enough (perhaps even interesting enough for me to actually talk to it) and I’m still learning. I’m off to go have a re-read of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">four parter Michael Cook did on generative AI for us</a>. Don’t do any murders while I’m gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
