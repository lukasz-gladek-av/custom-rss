            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has been listed for PC, bringing closer the moment in which you and I can learn why exactly Troy Baker is a glam rocker, why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> director George Miller (it's not actually him) has a cat demon, and why Turkish-German screenwriter Fatih Akin has become a living doll. Sony have yet to announce the PC version of Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> courier fantasy or give it a release date, but the Entertainment Software Rating Board have <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">a page up now</a>. Go on, Sony - call them liar liar, pants on fire.
</p>
<p>Which leads us neatly into the detail of said ESRB ratings page - it warns that you will encounter "a man set on fire in a fantastical manner" in Death Stranding 2. Possibly the man was being deceitful? A social stealth game featuring self-combustion would be neat, actually, and is absolutely the kind of brilliant garbage Kojima would develop. The ESRB further caution that "the word 'f**k' is heard in the game." Well, that's me out. I was already iffy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">the flagrant Snake bait</a>. I don't want to hear not-George Miller swear.
</p>
<p>I found the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a mixture of unbearable and fascinating, with the balance shifting towards fascinating as I revisited the game after review and made connections between its portering and path-beating mechanics and my own experiences of getting horribly lost in the vicinity of Kettlewell. It was also one of RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-games-of-2020">favourite games of 2020</a>, with Katharine (RPS in peace) calling it "a walking simulator in the very best sense of the word".
</p>
<p>The sequel remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. There's still time for a surprise end-of-year release. Come to think of it, isn't there some big industry awards show round the corner in December? In other news, Hideo Kojima has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people">learned so many ways to kill people</a> and we really should hurry up and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">send him to outer space</a>.</p>
