            <p>Take-Two Interactive have sold their publishing label Private Division to an unnamed party, along with five of Private Division's "live and unreleased titles". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher have also finally confirmed that they have shut down OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome devs Roll7 together with Kerbal Space Program 2 creators Intercept Games, months after performing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">mass</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">layoffs</a> at both studios.</p>
<p>"[W]e recently made the strategic decision to sell our Private Division label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," company president Karl Slatoff said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">an investor call last night</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." Take-Two are holding onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulslikers-are-going-to-love-ori-studios-new-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">Soulsy early access ARPG</a> from the makers of Ori And The Blind Forest. </p>
<p>"We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home," Slatoff added.</p>
<p>There's a bit more on the reasoning here in this <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">GamesIndustry.biz interview</a> with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick. The short version is that cool dystopian rollerskating games and sprawling engineer sandboxes do not make enough cash.  </p>
<p>"We're really best at these big AAA experiences," he said. "We have the biggest intellectual properties in the interactive entertainment business, some of the biggest intellectual properties in the overall entertainment business and to make sequels to existing beloved franchises as well as to create new hit intellectual properties is our mission.</p><p>"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick went on. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p>
<p>Take-Two have had "strong second quarter results" for their fiscal year 2025, something Zelnick largely attributes in this week's investor call to "the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises" (Borderlands, you might recall, recently had a movie adaptation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"benefited" Borderlands game sales</a> despite being a load of old rope). Zelnick anticipates "record" performance in 2026 and 2027, driven by the release of GTA 6, which Take-Two still have pegged for console launch in 2025 despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">rumours it might slip to 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Private Division was Take-Two's attempt to build an audience for more economical and adventurous "triple-I" games that combine the gloss of a GTA with relatively eccentric mechanics or stories. Take-Two aren't the only company to cut back on smaller experiments of late. Last month, Ubisoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-have-moved-to-other-projects-ubisoft-confirm-following-report-about-rejected-sequel-pitch">broken up the team responsible for the well-regarded Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (there were no layoffs).</p>
<p>In the wake of stagnating growth brought on by over-ambitious expansion during the Covid lockdown years, the investor-facing mindset appears currently to be: if it's not Assassin's Creed or GTA-scale, what's the point?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Along with basically every sci-fi universe of note</p>

            <p>
The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pilestedt pitched the Trench Crusade crossover last week in a Xitter reply. The debonair vultures of <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-cco-wants-crossover-sickest-thing-imaginable/">Videogamer</a> subsequently swooped in and did an article about it, which Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932">has also replied to</a>. "Yeah, but these are just musings," he qualified, noting that stirring too many or the wrong kind of third-party license into the Helldivers world might "dilute the IP". 
</p>
<p>
While this might read like an attempt to stave off further reporting, Piletstedt simply couldn't help sharing "an extended list of IPs that I really would love to do a take on", which the jolly jackals of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-creative-boss-doesnt-want-to-dilute-it-with-crossovers-but-his-list-of-dream-choices-has-some-real-deep-cuts/">PCGamer</a> have seized in their slavering jaws. And now, we're writing it up too. What kind of creature is Rock Paper Shotgun in this particular Attenborough scenario? We are <em>bugs</em>, of course. We are a horde of alien insects, emerging triumphantly from our burrows to chew upon the carcass of this story. Without further ado, here's Pilestedt's list.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Aliens
</p>
<p>
- Starship Troopers
</p>
<p>
- Terminator
</p>
<p>
- Predator
</p>
<p>
- Star Wars
</p>
<p>
- Fifth Element
</p>
<p>
- Blade Runner
</p>
<p>
- Warhammer 40k
</p>
<p>
- Trench Crusade
</p>
<p>
- Mutant Chronicles
</p>
<p>
- Dropzone Commander
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You could argue that there are already bits and pieces of those in Helldivers 2 as it stands. Starship Troopers is, of course, the book-and-movie franchise Helldivers takes inspiration from. The game's satirical forever-war fiction is basically 40K but without the crenelations and waxen seals. The Terminator, Alien and Predator loom large in the design of Helldivers enemy factions. Still, I see a few untapped possibilities here that might take Helldivers in fascinating directions. Here's a brief list.
</p>
<p>
- Do a Terminator expansion where one of your team-mates could be a Terminator in a skinsuit. Most of my team-mates are trying to kill me anyway.
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to add xenomorphs, make it so they can abduct Helldivers and cocoon them, giving colleagues a window of time in which to rescue them before they're facehugged
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to do Warhammer 40K, don't just add Space Marines. Give us the option of turning ourselves into Dreadnoughts when we die. Also, endow each map with an ambient level of warp activity, with demons emerging if you commit too much heresy (e.g. by drop-podding your comrades)
</p>
<p>
- As for Starship Troopers, let us talk to the bugs using telepathy. It's what Edge would want, and it actually happens at the end of the  Verhoeven film. Spoilers, I guess!!!!!
