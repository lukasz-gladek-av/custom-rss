            <p>If you missed its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/were-finally-getting-our-big-budget-kevin-costners-waterworld-game-in-tides-of-tomorrow">appearance last year</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides Of Tomorrow</a> is a choice-driven adventure game set in a brighter version of Waterworld, and is being made by the team behind road trip adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/road-96">Road 96</a>. Last night it was shown off again during the PlayStation State of Play, and this time the studio has stuck their post-apocalyptic harpoons into a release date. </p>

<p>It's coming out February 24th next year. The ocean-exploring game is set on a flooded earth on which "deadly plastification threatens to kill all living things". It mostly looks like an adventure of gathering resources, meeting strange new folk, and possibly killing them. </p>
<p>The catch is that you're always following in the wake of another player, whose own choices colour how people will react to you. In the trailer above we see Souls-esque phantoms of other adventurers affecting the player's world. They might have taken some loot you wanted, or maybe they threw a dude into the toxic water and now you've got to deal with the poor sick fella afterwards. It's basically a "choices matter" game, but someone else is doing the choosing. That said, other players may also be following you.</p>
<p>"Each person who plays is recorded, their choices are saved, and you can follow them along your journey! A friend? A streamer? The choice is yours!" say developers Digixart. "You will feel the impact from the consequences of the one you follow and must deal with them! It’s up to you to cooperate... or to make some waves!"</p>
<p>Okay, calm down please, marketing copy. No need for all those exclams. Anyway, there were a lot of choices to make in Road 96 too, the previous singleplayer game by Digixart. It was well-liked by Alice B (RPS in peace). "This political road trip is rendered an exciting and entertaining time by its cast and the deliberately piecemeal nature of its storytelling, rather than the story itself," she said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/road-96-review">her review</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Dice Legends is a fair bit more interesting than that name suggests</p>

            <p>I haven't yet decided whether the loot tortoise in roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dice-legends">Dice Legends</a> looks satisfied or exhausted. Both make sense to me. "He's grown used to this, but still isn't thrilled about it," offered my sister. I would not be thrilled either. Imagine being aware of Pratchett's world turtle and knowing you're a glorified ATM by comparison.</p>
<p>"A roguelike deckbuilder, Nic?", you exclaim with mock interest. "Well, kick me down a well and break out the Vimto we've had mouldering in the cellar since the nineties, the last decade in which anyone consumed or thought about Vimto. Haven't had one of those since the time I went to collect the post forty five seconds ago. Also, the post was two flyers, each advertising a roguelike deckbuilder". I will not argue with your sage industry analysis, friend, although this one does have a couple of notables that may make the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112170/Dice_Legends/">Steam demo</a> an intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>It's got lovely pixel art, for one, although thoughtful art direction isn't too surprising. Dice Legends is the latest project from CD Project alum Rafał Jaki, co-creator of The Witcher 3's Gwent minigame and showrunner on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>It's also got a tabletop twist on traditional card flinging. Each of the three playable heroes uses a different type of dice (D6, D8, or the haughty D12 - also known in some circles as 'the shape bastard'), and you'll use these to roll a dice pool to activate cards. Some cards need a number within a certain range but will still have the same effect. Others scale up with your dice results. Otherwise, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at its very core. Attack, build up shield to defend against telegraphed damage, apply debuffs, and conquer nodes on an overworld map.</p>
<p>Additionally, the soundtrack is pure Bardcore. It is certified <em>jaunty</em> up in here. Is Dice Legends a 'fifth page on the Nintendo Eshop sale'-ass name for a game? Yes. But I think it's good time nonetheless. This one's out in the third quarter of the year, to use the language of my most hated enemies, the year quarterers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
