            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed Palfarm, a new farming spin-off whose cheeky compound title implies the possibility of countless other Palspin-offs, from Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/train-simulator">train Simulator</a> to Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">netenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be a Palworld version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, with players alternating between tending crops, mining the caves, battling wildlife, and bonding with the local NPCs. As in vanilla Palworld, you can capture Pals with different abilities and set them to work on tasks like sowing and watering. Here's a trailer.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmurGwwjvGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-farming-spin-off-revealed-just-11-days-after-nintendo-announced-pokemon-equivalent-pokopia">Eurogamer</a> note, all this follows swiftly after the reveal of Nintendo's new Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, which also involves farming. Nintendo are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">suing Pocket Pair for alleged patent infringement regarding the Pokémon series</a>, which makes the announcement of Palfarm a bit like playfully tweaking the genitals of an enraged Pyroar while it's trying to bite your head off.
</p><p>
You can read more about Palfarm on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It appears to be retaining Palworld's viral blend of whimsy and parodic cruelty. "On this island with its changing seasons, a relaxing farm life with Pals awaits!" chirrups the description. "Of course, eating your own Pals is absolutely out of the question!" 
</p>
<p>
Later, there is mention of killing off Pals in the wilderness, because "after all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way" and "sometimes what you reap might be red". Congratulations, Pocketpair, you have triangulated the secret callousness of the videogame concept of "farming".
</p>
<p>
There's multiplayer, and a town with a commercial area and a hidden black market. The black market appears to be run by a pipe-smoking blaggard with a very large revolver. You can play Russian roulette with him, seemingly. You can also push snowballs to make them bigger, and get married. No release date yet.

            <p>Bound by Duty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>’s first big update in months, has just gone live. On top of expanding the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-darktides-nightmares-and-visions-update-adds-in-a-sprinkle-of-left-4-dead-and-you-can-try-it-out-now">Mortis Trials arena mode</a> and adding a selection of new heretic mincing tools, it makes significant skill tree changes to three of Darktide’s five playable classes – the Veteran, Psyker, and Zealot – aimed at "increased flexibility and player agency". Including, it seems, the flexibility to blow up your own head more effectively.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here be <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/bound-by-duty-free-update-out-now/112661">patch notes</a>, and a more general (i.e. less stat-soaked) <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update">overview</a>. I’ve just had a quick look at the new trees in-game and they do appear to be structured more openly, at least at the lower levels, so you may not need to commit to a playstyle – tanky berserker versus swift dagger stabbist on Zealot, for example – quite so early on.</p>
<p>As for specific skill buffs, I can’t judge yet who the big winners and losers of this patch are, but by far the <em>funniest</em> talent rework has to go to the Psyker’s Crystalline Will. It still prevents you from downing yourself if you overload on psychic sauce, but a massive buff to the accompanying warp eruption sounds like it could make for a serious offensive tool. Expect mic’d up Psykers to change their tune from "Oh no, I’m exploding" to "Oh <em>yes</em>, I’m exploding".</p>
<p>Less fortunate are the space rozzers of the Adeptus Arbites, who’ve been made squishier following their arrival (accompanied by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">packs of EMP dogbombs</a>) earlier this year. They and the three reworked classes have all had full skill point refunds, so make sure to reinvest them before deploying.</p><p>Mortis Trials, meanwhile, gets a frigid new arena, plus a handful of new perks to unlock as you survive successive waves of Nurgle’s lads. Veterans, those lucky devils, also get a class-exclusive Power Falchion sword, and those who spec as ranged specialists should get even more of a kick out of the new Boltgun and Bolt Pistol variants. These, the Bolt Pistol Mk VI Godwyn‑Branx and Boltgun Mk III Locke, are tuned to make their exploding bullets more explodey – evidently, between these, that tweaked Psyker skill, and the Arbites’ remote-detonated pets, someone at Fatshark just really likes seeing things go boom.</p>
<p>As a piece of Imperium cannon fodder who typically prefers the flow of conventional missions to the more static defence play of Mortis Trials, I’m slightly saddened that Bound by Duty doesn’t offer a fresh taste of the former. Not least because almost all of the post-launch missions have been excellent, with more ambitious set-pieces and more intriguing, lore-massaging vox banter. But then, I barely played anyone besides Ogryn after his own rework in March, so maybe another round of skill touch-ups can have a similarly rejuvenating effect. I’ll be playing this week to find out.</p>

            <p>
Dear Hideo Kojima, you'd better give us a proper update on your new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-creator-hideo-kojima-is-working-on-a-brand-new-action-espionage-game-that-is-also-a-movie">action-espionage game-movie</a> wotsit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> soon, because for every hour that passes, I think of another unbearable title pun. </p>
<p>I'm not very Physinterested in Physint right now, a game defined by what it Physisn't. Perhaps I'd be more Physinto it if Kojima Productions would share a proper outline and explore the Physintricacies. But this is Hideo Kojima, a man of *grunts, strains* Sphysint-like enigma. Still, at least we now know that Don Lee from Train To Busan is in the stealthy film-o-game, together with Charlee Fraser from Furiosa and Minami Hamabe from Godzilla Minus One.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a livestream last night, Kojima discussed working with 3Lateral to model each performer's face. He shared some early renders of Hamabe in-engine. Yep, sure looks like a face.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Push Square / Kojima Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
He also shared some concept art from Physint, which certainly underlines the Metal Gear connections. There is a man in a flapping coat with a high collar. Or half a flapping coat, anyway. I can't work out where the coat ends and his utility belt ends. He's got a lot of weird harness wrapped around his right shoulder. Doubtless, this is Tactical.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kojima Productions</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Also, a rifle with a scope and a stock and a silencer. We can expect a mix of sneaky and open firefights, I expect. Behind the man there are tall forbidding buildings with a lonely bird visible against slate clouds. Hang on, the lonely bird is just a stray coffee grain on my laptop screen. Let me wipe it away. Ah, now I feel sad about the missing bird.
</p>
<p>
Is this sadness the Feeling referred to by the caption "Here Comes the Feeling"? Probably not. When will the Feeling actually arrive? Maybe in "another five or six years", Kojima <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet">commented in May</a>.</p>
<p>Physint is actually "in development", now, following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> on console. Kojima decided to make a new game in the vein of Metal Gear following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-metal-gear-fans-after-illness-in-2020">recent illness</a>. Here's hoping the next trailer or livestream at least features more legible Tactical apparel. Physint, reveal thyself!
