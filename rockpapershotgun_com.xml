Why is everything rolling sideways on my desk all of a sudden? What’s this mysterious force, dragging my chair towards the wall? Why are all the cars in the vicinity tumbling and rolling in the direction of *checks press release* ...North Carolina, USA? It can only be gravitational disturbance caused by the impending 1.0 release of a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> project. This time it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heart-of-the-machine">Heart of the Machine</a>, a “4X-style”, “dimension-busting” sci-fi game developed by Arcen Games and published by Hooded Horse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I’m always up for a new Hooded Horse gig, but I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-strategy-game-terra-invicta-is-an-alien-invasion-sim-so-vast-and-slow-the-aliens-seem-lost-within-it">still trying to figure out spacewar in Terra Invictus</a>. And now, ladies and gentlebots, you would have me contend with a game in which I play a super-advanced AI trying to conquer a grim future civilisation from the inside. A game that will last an estimated 90-175 hours. A game that boasts of “a mind-boggling array of goals, story-threads, and opportunities for players to pursue as they seek to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving from itself.”
</p>
<p>
Still, at least this is the <em>fun</em> kind of AI, the homely 80s action movie breed of AI that simply wishes to weaponise bees, build android armies and hack fortified skyscrapers. Not the actually existing, present-day kind of AI that consists of a billion typewriter monkeys who want to summarise your emails so your boss can make your labour 1.2% more profitable, at least till the world runs out of silicon, water and fossil fuels. I exaggerate! I hope I’m exaggerating. Besides, there probably are typewriter monkeys in Heart of the Machine, which also promises “parkour bears”, velociraptors and cat palaces.
</p>
<p>
“The 1.0 update will usher in a whole new ending, with four potential variants that involve everything from wormholes to last-minute betrayals, to players winning control over the entire city,” explains the press release. The developer has a longer account of the changes (and post-1.0 plans) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001070/view/742666698308452997?l=english">Steam</a>, which is quite interesting. I wasn’t expecting a Fire Emblem: Three Houses comparison. You can also find the game on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heart_of_the_machine">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/heart-of-the-machine-84306f">Epic Games Store</a>.
