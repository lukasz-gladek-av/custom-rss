The bar for getting me to write up a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> has never been higher. I don't care how many twists you throw into the formula, developers. I don't care how imaginatively you have reinvented the wheel of permadeath and unlocks. I am tired of this genre/wantonly adhesive cultural phenomenon. I wish for it to die in shame and ignominy.</p>
<p>You've made a roguelike in which attacks are performed by assembling a manga page, you say? Well... go on then. Here's a trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>.

"Each turn, you receive new panels," developers Mono Entertainment <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187880/_Manga_Build_Roguelike/">explain on Steam</a>. "Placing them on the page creates your action sequence. Place panels according to the situation, build the ultimate page, and defeat your enemies!"</p>
<p>Taking damage tears holes in the paper, and you can't plug manga scenes into holes, so you'll ideally nobble all your enemies in a single turn, before they strike back. It would be lovely if the pages you assemble made sense and flowed properly as in an actual manga - it looks like there's some repetition, going by the trailer.
</p><p>
How do you unlock new varieties of panel for combat? By means of, amongst other things, "surreal little mini-game events", such as barbecuing fish and confronting bears, possibly because the bears are trying to eat your fish. There are three characters who together form a Streets Of Ragey ensemble. Akira is a hitman who likes guns and punching. Yoko is good at mobile attacks - behold her teleporting in the trailer. And Suzuki is some other kind of assassin who can lay traps.
</p>
<p>
There's a puzzle mode which gives you a limited selection of panels with which to complete an encounter, and a bonus mode in which Yoko and some "playboy" called Yuki have a drinking competition. I cannot read the Japanese dialogue in the gifs, so I can't currently give you any sense of whether Yuki is a massive creep, but odds seem fair.
</p>
<p>Some additional background: Mono Entertainment were founded by a New York University design graduate, and are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393890/IGNISTONE/">Ignistone</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812120/Clock_Rogue/">Clock Rogue</a>. "The Fable" is an actual manga series published by Kodansha, with millions of readers: it's about a super-assassin capable of killing anybody in six seconds, who is trying to live a normal life at his boss's instruction.</p>
<p>
I've just realised that this is one of those dang deckbuilders as well - the manga panels are effectively cards, innit. Those fiends! They snuck that one right by me. Anyway, this one's launching on 5th November, and there's a demo on the way.

Look, we all know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is a weird little series. You can torture your Sims, meet fairies and werewolves and vampires, have half alien babies. So I feel like I shouldn't be all that surprised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion pack, Adventure Awaits, seeing the return of imaginary friends. And yet here I am, taken aback and slightly horrified by the game's interpretation of imaginary friends in its first gameplay trailer.
</p>
<p>
I truly find them existentially uncomfortable. Imaginary friends come in the shape of four different dolls that can morph into humanoid creatures that will keep your Sim child company if no one else will. You can choose between four different personalities for them too, which includes Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and funniest of all, straight up Evil.

<p>
Worst of all, if your Sim child bonds with the imaginary friend enough, they can Pinocchio-style turn into a real human. A lot of ethical questions being raised here I'm not confident the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game will answer, and quite honestly I don't know if I'd want them around my own kids (NB: I don't have any, but let's imagine I do for this joke to land).
</p><p>
That's not what the expansion pack is solely about, though, in fact it's mostly not about getting your children to create human life. Adventure Awaits also introduces three new neighbourhoods for your Sims to explore, with activities like fishing in mountain streams, sharing campfire stories, or just having a romantic retreat. This comes with a new feature, Scheduling Getaway, which allows your Sims to plan weekend trips or summer holidays. Alternatively, with the game's new Custom Venues and Getaway System, you can make your own getaway spots for your Sims to hang out in.
</p>
<p>
At least those retreats sound like a nice reprieve from the horrors presented by the imaginary friends. In any case, Adventure Awaits is out October 2nd, so you don't have to wait very long.

            <p>Have you brought batteries for your torch? Good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s Deep of the Night update's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">primed to arrive in the wee hours of tomorrow, September 11th</a>, and there's a pretty hefty balancing patch to dissect before it arrives.</p>
<p>I've cracked <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">the notes</a> open already and I'll be honest, I'm a bit surprised. Well, maybe concerned is the best way to put it. You see, the word increased is used an awful lot in relation to stuff you can do hurt an enemy. That seems fishy. Just what have you got planned to make lives miserable again once Deep of the Night drops at 2:30AM BST, FromSoft?</p>

<p>Let's start with version 1.02.2's batch of changes to each of the Nightfarer classes aside from Ironeye, who's presumably been left out because he must already be perfect. Wylder's gained more poise while casting claw shot, which now dishes out more stamina damage to blocking foes. The strength and dexterity gains Guardian earns on levelling up have been boosted, as has the range of their steel guard passive.</p><p>Duchess' dexterity gain on level up has also risen, some of her dagger attacks are more powerful, and her finale ultimate art has had its duration lengthened. The trade-off is a decrease in her two-handed dagger’s second heavy attack damage. Raider's greataxe and great hammer-induced stagger, Recluse's Magic Cocktail spells, and Executor's cursed sword attacks have all gotten more effective. Oh, and you can now walk straight through Revenant’s spirits, Helen and Frederick. I'm not sure whether that last one counts as a buff or nerf - let's call it a quirk.</p>
<p>On top of that, the stagger damage inflicted by dual-wielded jump attacks has been boosted across the board for small and medium arms, while it's been dialled down for larger weapons.</p>
<p>Flipping across to the everdark sovereigns, the famously tough Equilibrious Beast has gotten the most adjustments. "We have confirmed an issue where condemned Nightfarers summoned during this fight may not be rendered under specific conditions," Fromsoft also note in relation to that boss, promising to address that problem down the line. Aside from that, Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight look to have gotten slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>The Night’s Tide will also now dish out more damage after you beat the second night boss. A PC-specific tweak worth noting is that FromSoft reckon they've improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s stability "in some environments", so hopefully you'll find things run more smoothly in the Deep of the Night.</p>
<p>Right, there we go. Best of luck rolling in the deep. Assuming you've not jumped in early thanks to mods.</p>
