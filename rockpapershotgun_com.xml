            <p>You know when you're friends with three people, then one of them suddenly pulls a Robbie Rotten and morphs into a real villain who terrorises your existence? No? Just me then, and also the protagonist of Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, whose main foe you'll get to dictate the identity of through your actions in the game.</p>
<p>It happens via a villainy system, which Levine and the crew at Ghost Story Games discuss in the first ever Judas dev log they've just put out. We've only seen this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-was-basically-a-corridor-says-ken-levine-judas-wont-be-and-characters-will-have-long-memories">non-corridory</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a>-like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-has-reactive-difficulty-evil-dentist-chairs-and-a-giant-robot-dog-for-fast-travel">evil dentist chairs</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-latest-gameplay-still-looks-a-lot-like-a-sci-fi-bioshock-now-with-evil-brum-and-a-robot-chef">evil Brum</a> in spits and spurts since the announcement in 2022. This looks to the first sign of more regular updates in the offing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'd already heard a bit about the 'big three', a trio of key characters who'll be key to your adventures aboard the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. In this <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">dev log</a>, Levine and co reveal that they've got some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> nemesis system-inspired stuff going on.</p>
<p>Basically, rather than having a traditional baddie who's nailed on as being your foil from the get go - Ã  la BioShock's Frank Fontaine - you'll start off as mates with the big three. How you play the game and the choices you make'll influence how much they like you, leading to one eventually deciding they're no longer your mate and becoming the game's villain. Or, as Levine puts it:</p>
<blockquote>In Judas, you're going to get to know these characters intimately. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't.</blockquote>
<p>He also adds that the trio will judge you as you play, including "how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting". No, please, don't hate me just because I'm shite at resource management and keep running away from fights like a coward, Judasers! Whichever of them ends up being en-baddieised gets "a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals", with the example given being a character called Tom turning previously recruitable sheriff bots against you.</p><p>It sounds like it could be cool, but I worry players who've tried their best to keep all three happy will find it incongruent when one of them turns bad, because the game's reached the point when it's decided it needs a baddie in place. Or, conversely, be railroaded into setting off a villain arc in a manner that might feel forced. There's also the matter of whether a baddie whose very baddieness relies on responding to player actions will be able to muster motivations and personality traits as in-depth as a character who's built to be a baddie from the ground up. To me, there's potentially a danger of blunting the story a bit in favour of making it more reactive, something that can be to a game's detriment.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see how Judas tackles all of that. As of this dev log, it's still got no release date, with Levine explaining the team don't want to reveal one just to have to change it later. There's at least some key art by American movie poster artist Drew Struzan to stare at while we wait.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> is still trying to fix up those gosh-danged Age transitions. For those just joining us, when you move between Ages in Firaxis's latest historical map-painter, it's sort of like starting over. You're asked to pick a new Civilisation, appropriate to the Age, and your units will be reshuffled, downgraded and, in some cases, deleted like rabid dogs. The game also runs a broom over the geography, rearranging all the resources. </p>
<p>It's supposed to be a pace-changer, and as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play">a notorious earlygame drop-out</a>, I can certainly see the logic behind that, but the feature has riled a lot of antique Civvers up. Firaxis have tweaked the Age system extensively post-launch, but many recent Steam reviews still list it as a downside. This week, they rolled out yet another patch, while detailing plans for a new approach to Age transitions that is actually "harsher" than the original. It's a bold (4X) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> (game), Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for them.
</p>
<p>A quick recap: Firaxis have previously introduced an Age transition impact setting, letting players choose between having the game gather up your units between transitions, as in the original design, and a new "continuity" option that retains their map locations. 
</p>
<p>"Continuity Mode is a nice way to allow players less disruption to their military campaigns if they like to be fighting continuously from one Age to the next," explains Ed Beach, creative director. "I don't use that setting often in my games, but I did enjoy it recently when I played a full campaign with Genghis Khan as my leader." I do love the concept of Genghis Khan's quest for world domination getting repeatedly reset by a bunch of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2024.2373542#abstract">bullshit periodisation</a>. Naughty rampaging warlords! We'll stop-start the WAAAAGH right out of you.
</p><p>Much as Beach enjoys the new setting, he feels Firaxis erred in making it the new default while hiding the previous "Regroup" option in the advanced settings. This made it easy to forget which kind of transition you have enabled. As such, the latest patch on Steam and the Epic Games Store makes your choice of Age transition setting "sticky" between campaigns, together with game speed and difficulty. 
</p>
<p>Even as they soften the workings, however, Firaxis are devising another, "harsher" version of Regroup, "a setting we are tentatively calling Collapse". There are no details as to why this is "harsher", but "Collapse" implies further unit loss and degradation, I guess. Perhaps it'll be a kind of "Dark Age" mechanic. "It's still early in testing, and we'll need time to see if it feels fun and fits well into the game," Beach says. "If it does, we'll look into when it might make sense to include it in a future update."
</p>
<p>That's not all they wrote. The <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">full patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.2.4</a> also mention a few bug fixes, but none of these seem as momentous to my eye as the on-going Age discourse. Are you still playing? Have your feelings changed much since launch?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">second round of jobs cuts</a> this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods.</p>
<p>The news comes not too long after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July</a>. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-we-made-the-very-difficult-decision-activity-7366524687985594369-VkBI">LinkedIn post</a>, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go.</p>
<p>"Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition."</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">set to be published by Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Among the former Crystal Dynamics staff who've shared that they're among those laid off are senior animator Jaron Gittleman and senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366546777795162112/">Matthew Angus</a>. "Well it finally happened," Gittleman <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaron-gittleman_opentowork-activity-7366573142506426369-n2Fo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. "After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth. I learned so much and worked with some of the best. I'll miss them dearly."</p>
<p>Best of luck to all affected.</p>

            <p>What a strange reality we live in, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-loves-combat-so-much-it-feels-like-its-fighting-itself">Silent Hill is becoming worryingly actionised</a> and Resident "No thanks bro" Evil is perceived as being too scary. Horror developers: that is the <em>wrong way around</em>. Regardless, the latter point has been raised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi himself, who told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/resident-evil/resident-evil-7-was-possibly-too-scary-and-some-people-couldnt-handle-it-says-director-koshi-nakanishi-and-thats-why-resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-mode-to-make-it-slightly-easier-to-deal-with/">GamesRadar+</a> that part of the reasoning for giving the upcoming sequel a choice of first and third person modes was that the solely FPP <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7</a> â which Nakanishi also directed â maybe worked a little too well at enabling scares.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Looking back at Resident Evil 7's first person perspective, I implemented that as a way to make it more immersive and more scary than ever before," he said. "Which I think most, you know, media and players agreed it was an incredibly scary game, but it was possibly too scary."</p> <figure>

<p>Requiem doesnât strictly intend to induce fewer gasps and squeaks â itâs previously been pitched as offering "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-core-concept-behind-resident-evil-requiem-is-addictive-fear-which-isnt-entirely-as-silly-as-it-sounds">addictive fear</a>" â but its third-person option will at least attempt to ease up on the intensity, for those who donât want the beasties getting quite so up in their faces.</p>
<p>"I think some people couldn't handle it, and either couldn't finish or didn't even start [Resi 7]," Nakanishi continues. "And that's something that I look back on thinking that, you know, I want to make sure that people can enjoy this game. So if you started the game off in first person perspective, and you're finding it's too much, then third person is almost a way to step slightly back from that level of horror and make it slightly easier to deal with by having the character on screen as a kind of avatar of yourself."</p><p>I doubt this has been a recent revelation in Capcomâs minds, as the intervening <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> returned to third person for its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-now-try-a-demo-of-resident-evil-villages-new-third-person-mode">Shadow of Rose expansion</a>, including the added option to â hey, this sounds familiar â play the entire main game in either FPP or TPP. And Iâd say Requiem having this choice from the start would let Nakanishi direct its scripted scares with the possibility of multiple perspectives in mind, but then what weâve seen of the new game suggests it takes the same approach to cutscenes as Villageâs third person mode: simply cutting back to first-person until you regain control.</p>
<p>As such, swinging out to an over-the-shoulder camera still wonât spare you from <em>every</em> in-yer-face jump scare, or lingering closeup of a monsterâs gob. Iâd also add that, having played the same Requiem demo that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">Edwin did back in June</a>, Iâd agree with him that it generally seems crafted with a preference for seeing straight through the eyes of new protagonist Grace Ashcroft. Hearing through her ears, too. I, uh, completely forgot to try third person mode at the time, but itâs hard to imagine Graceâs panicked breaths and the dreadful heaviness of nearby footsteps having the same nerve-rustling impact with several feet of extra in-game distance. Still, apparently thatâs the point.</p>
