            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is out now, and while it's a lot prettier or at least, more Unreal than the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3, it's got its fair share of technical problems. Curiously, two of the major crashing issues involve crocodiles. If you want a smooth opening bout of Snake Eater, I would avoid either pretending to be a crocodile or having lunch in the presence of a hungry one. Did a crocodile work on this game? There seems to be some underlying reptilian resentment at work, which I guess is to be expected from a game called Snake Eater.

<p>Konami, of course, are well aware of these issues, and are working on a patch. They'll roll the fixes out in stages, with exact release timing to follow. Here's their shortlist of the known issues, plucked from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Who amongst us has not rolled into a crawl and ended up drifting across the scenery? I think it's got something to do with eating parsnips after their sell-by-date. Konami are mum as to what might happen if you roll into a crawl while wearing a crocodile hat. Presumably, your keyboard will grow teeth and clamp shut around your hands.</p>
<p>Sulky swamp lizards aside, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is notable for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-platinum-game-hidden-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-thats-actually-a-remake-of-a-rework-of-a-zone-of-the-enders-3-prototype">a whole Platinum game inside it that is secretly a cancelled Zone Of The Enders 3 prototype</a>. </p>
