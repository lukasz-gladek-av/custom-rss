            <p>The folks behind the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a> aiming to push lawmakers into taking action to stop publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">shutting down the servers of online games</a> in a fashion that leaves them unplayable have hosted a livestream from the EU Parliament building itself following their latest meeting with the European Commission. The group say that meeting went "fine", and used the stream to emphasise the bipartisan support their cause has amassed among MEPs so far.</p>

<p>"The meeting went fine," Stop Killing Games organiser Moritz Katzner said towards the end of the hour-long stream, "They've been open pretty much the same back when we met with them [in October] on the Digital Fairness Act. Half of them being completely in support, the other half saying, 'No, on law we don't think your position is correct.' So, we'll have to see. I'm going to be honest, the commission has factually no interest to bring us in and we're anticipating that, because guess what - the European Union is made up of far more than just the European Commission."</p>
<p>Eventually, the group hope the action they're proposing be made law to combat game shutdowns will be debated in a trilogue meeting, which brings together representatives from the European Commission, EU Council, and the European Parliament for one big chat.</p><p>Katzner emphasised that the campaign has support from members of the European parliament belonging to groups at various points on the left/right political spectrum. On the left, he mentioned German MEP Tiemo Wölken of the European Parliament's Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) political group, to which 135 MEPs out of the 720 currently serving belong. On the right, he mentioned Polish MEP Piotr Müller of the European Conservatives and Reformists group, to which 79 MEPs currently belong. Finally, there's some support from the Greens/European Free Alliance group, which currently has 53 MEPs. Those are three of the eight <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/organisation-and-rules/organisation/political-groups">political groups</a> which MEPs can belong to, with these being alliances of like-minded politicians who retain the final say on how they individually vote on issues.</p>
<p>One of the MEPs supporting the campaign, Greens/European Free Alliance member <a href="https://gregorova.eu/">Markéta Gregorová</a> - a politician from the centre/centre-left <a href="https://www.pirati.cz/lide/">Czech Pirate Party</a> - appeared on the livestream. She began by referencing the effect campaigns like Stop Killing Games have had on recent EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-online-child-sexual-abuse-material-csam-privacy/">debates over proposed laws</a> which would allow the scanning of private messages by authorities in an attempt to detect online child abuse contentin 2021 it, something <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/the-disguised-return-of-the-eus-private-message-scanning-plot">digital rights campaigners</a> argue would constitute an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>"In 2021, it seemed like in the parliament everybody just voted for [chat control] because it's protection of children, right? But then massively people like you send out emails and messages to MEPs here, to everyone, and suddenly everybody switched both in the governments and in the parliament," she said. "So really if you send an email [in support of Stop Killing Games] and feel [you might not have done enough]...it really matters, because if they receive enough of it, they consider it important enough for then me and of course others who are a little bit more knowledgeable about the topic to persuade them about the data, about the arguments - otherwise they just go with the flow of their group." </p>
<p>As for the progress of Stop Killing Games' EU proposals, she continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Now, we are of course at the beginning. So there will be a lot of harassment towards the commission that we will need to do. But also another positive/optimistic point, we don't necessarily need [to propose] new legislation [and] wait for the commission. There is the upcoming <a href="https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/">Digital Fairness Act</a>. You probably heard about it, the commission already presented it to us and now we will be able in the parliament to give out amendments, Maybe change it a lot, maybe implement some of these things that would also ensure that in terms of gaming and protection of your games [and] your data, what you bought is not being stolen away from you by the companies that just don't want to continue keeping the servers up or something. I will definitely focus on such amendments and please write to your representatives so that they focus on this.</blockquote>
<p>While the campaign's proposals work their way through the European political process, Stop Killing Games' organisers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-campaign-hope-to-signal-that-were-not-just-going-away-by-setting-up-online-game-preservation-ngos">recently announced plans to start up NGOs</a> dedicated to promoting the issue in Europe and the US.</p>

Let me slash the tendons of that strutting headline with some immediate caveats. Most obviously, you will not like Cicamadata” if you have an overpowering hatred of feisty punctuation in game titles. You will not like it if you're averse to abstract and ostentatiously computerised, 'product design' art direction that is somehow both bright and foggy, crisp and distorted.</p>
<p>You won’t like it if you really dislike artisanal glitches and general HUD palaver – cockroach text scuttling across the view; boxy white velocity lines; an oversized Doomguy-style character model to indicate health; damage and state changes that cause the screen to blink and reset, as though you’d jolted a cable.
</p>

<p>
You may be especially unkeen on Cicamadata” if you try to play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4257090/CICADAMATA_Demo_Disc/?curator_clanid=45851876">Steam demo</a> on a Latitude 5320 Dell i5-1145G7 with 16 GB of RAM and integrated graphics, like my work laptop. The demo crashed my laptop three times before I grudgingly shuffled over to my review PC, though it ran comfortably enough during the tutorials.
</p>
<p>
Now that the rhetorical ankle-slicing is over, let us bask in the glow of what is not only my favourite FPS demo of recent times but also, one of the few demos I’ve played that conjures the same urge to replay and squeeze out every last drop of blood that I once felt for magazine cover disc demos in the 1990s. 
</p>

<p>
Inasmuch as the writing spells anything out for sure, Cicamadata” casts you as a wayward soul stuffed into the carapace of a super-mobile bunny bot, equipped with what may be either a three-pellet, flip-to-reload shotgun or some kind of grieving, triumphant demigod – as the Steam page puts it, “i am joyeuse. i am not the weapon that failed. i have given everything to masters who forgot my name." 
</p><p>
You’re dropshipped into a bunch of maps that look like enormous, ethereal circuit boards, some floating in the sky, others half-underwater, some encased in ice, others covered in plastic vegetation. Your job is to gather a bunch of CORES and get to the EXIT. Red things are bad things that need to be shot, jumped on, or slammed into. You’ve got a triple-jump and a forward dash you can perform in the air - a dash that will carry you clean past the platform you’re aiming at, until you develop your rhythm. 
</p>
<p>
Save for one corridor affair that teaches you to attack certain foes in certain ways, the demo levels are airy, open-ended creations with secrets above and below. But when you are in full flight, picking off enemy crabs and gun turrets in a jumble of cybernetic squeals and chirping cooldowns, even the largest of these volumes shrinks to a snowglobe, yours to roll about as you please.</p>
<p>It’s good to be fast: Cicamadata” is a speedrunner’s game with omnipresent leaderboards, though you’re free to bounce and roar around the demo levels for as long as you wish. I had great fun discovering each demo map’s terrain conditions – the ice level is slippy, as you’d expect, and the underwater areas slow your shotgun blasts to shoals, obliging you to lead targets.
</p>
<p>
When I first covered Cicamadata” I compared it to the PS1’s Jumping Flash!, another game with exasperating title punctuation that represents a road not entirely taken for first-person platformers, made up of stratospheric playgrounds navigated by means of a big-footed robot shadow. I’m shocked to discover how much Cicamadata” pays homage to that game, even more so than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1187870/FORZA_POLPO/">Forza Polpo</a> (which I also love). 
</p><p>
There’s the same basic language of waypoints, the same sense that each level is a compact paradise of things to find and jump on and burst into flecks. But Cicamadata” blends the PS1 game’s rabbity whimsy with a queer and insectile savagery. “Obligations no longer bind you,” promises your handler. “Tear flesh from bone.”
</p>
<p>
The demo is live on Steam from now until March 5th. Go on, hop in. See if you can beat my seventh place leaderboard finish in the ice level. The full game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817250/CICADAMATA/">out later this year</a>.
