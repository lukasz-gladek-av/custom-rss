A little over three years since it was announced, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreamsettler">Dreamsettler</a>, the spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, has been cancelled. Yesterday, lead developer Jay Tholen shared a video simply titled "Dreamsettler is canceled", where he explained some of his reasoning behind the decision. "This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of the video.
</p>

<p>
After noting that he "didn't want to make a video like this," the developer went on to explain that Dreamsettler is cancelled, going on to say that this means "it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."

<p>
He also noted how it was bad timing given that a Patreon to help keep the project going was only launched earlier this year. There are also plans to try to release the part of the game that do exist, including the soundtrack from returning composer The Chowder Man, in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
In a short version of events, Tholan explained that with Dreamsettler, they had a budget this time, so "we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time." In turn, there was a specific schedule to follow, and Tholen noted he has "never successfully made a game based on a design document."
</p>
<p>
He later said that he thinks he's a "hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."
</p>
<p>
In the years since announcing Dreamsettlers, Tholen did also work on Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, a boomer shooter spin-off made by the in-world Hypnospace Outlaw character Zane - former RPS staffer Liam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slayers-x-terminal-aftermath-vengance-of-the-slayer-review-a-boisterous-hypnospace-spin-off-thats-an-obnoxious-gem">reviewed it</a> and had some positive but mixed feelings on it. Co-founder John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypnospace-outlaw-review">reviewed</a> Hypnospace Outlaw back in the day too, coming away from it quite enamoured.

            <p>
Ever since Gravity Rush 2 came out eight years ago (let's not focus too hard on how much time that actually is for my mental health), I have, unfortunately, not been able to stop thinking about it. It is a game with a world full of whimsy, video game ass mechanics, and, most interestingly of all, a plot that quite directly deals with topics like class. What more can you want! And yet a sequel has never materialised. Lucky for me, just yesterday a new gravity shifting game entered the scene: Metro Gravity.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Metro Gravity isn't just a clone of Gravity Rush. Where the PlayStation game lets you control gravity at will, Metro Gravity lets you walk on almost any surface, with the option to lock in the gravity of wherever you're standing. There are abilities that let you shift gravity in particular directions, but what is essentially the power of flight isn't available to you in Metro Gravity (at least, in as much of the game as I have played).

There are more twists beyond that too. Its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> combat is rhythm-game adjacent in that enemies will attack you to the beat of whatever track is playing at any given moment (these vary from place to place, more on that in a second). A short while into the game you'll pick up the ability to parry a la Sekiro, and with that in hand the combat becomes an artful balance of dodging, blocking, and attacking at just the right moments. It's oh so delicious, if it's your kind of thing anyway.
</p>
<p>
The final spin, and perhaps the biggest, is that it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Most metroidvanias typically take the route of the second dimension rather than the third, and with the fact that Metro Gravity lets you walk on any wall, you might rightly have a fear that it becomes confusing to navigate. I haven't found that yet myself, as while it took me a moment to adjust in terms of my spatial reasoning, when you find a map of a particular area - these range in aesthetics and vibes, and consequently music, and thusly an array of music to time your attacks to - it becomes fairly simple to figure out where to go.
</p>
<p>
I quite like what I've played of Metro Gravity, I often think about how there aren't enough 3D metroidvanias in the world, and I feel quite excited to jump back into this one! The game just launched on Steam yesterday, and you can check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">here</a>.
