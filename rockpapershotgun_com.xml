            <p>Please excuse the eyeball jelly. I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindwave">Mindwave</a>'s minigame barrage. The current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741670/MINDWAVE_Demo/">Steam demo</a> is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy". It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:</p>

<p>It's set in a "cognitive reality game" tournament, and your role as Pandora is to play frenetic rounds of minigames - most last just a few seconds before jumping to the next - in between chatting to the other contestants. "MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP OF MINDSCAPE TOWER. DELVE INTO THE MINDS OF YOUR OPPONENTS. BE CONSUMED BY THE TRUTH THEY SPEAK TO YOU, IN THIS CEREBRAL BATTLE OF SIGHT AND SOUND HIDDEN WITHIN EACH OF US", reads the Steam page. I'd usually reformat the caps there but honestly, Mindwave earns it caps.</p>
<p>In the short time I've played, I have: won a pistol duel to the death, fed some Tamagotchi-like creatures, caught a cat, brushed some hair, popped bubblewrap, spammed some typing, and several other things that went by too fast for me to remember. It's all very twee but quietly insidious at the same time.</p><p>It looks to have taken off in a big way already. The game is currently raising funds for a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/holohammer/mindwave">full release on Kickstarter</a>, but development team HoloHammer's socials are already brimming <a href="https://x.com/holohammer_">with fanart</a>. Members of the team have previously worked on several smaller games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618580/Run_Doodleguy/">Run, Doodleguy!</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/P_s9pjiB7qY">INSOMNIARY</a>, but say this is their biggest project yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JwFiIUAa5Jg">Dorkus64's soundtrack</a> is a real highlight here, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> a pleasing word to say? <em>Straftat</em>. It almost demands an angry bark, an accusatory finger. <em><strong>Straftat!</strong></em> The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a>, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> appears among them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Included in the update you'll find 15 maps named some variation of "TheSamePlace". If you know your Counter-Strike history you will recognise the layout of fy_iceworld. A simple boxy set of corridors with a few waist-high cover spots, and a cramped central buy zone where you will certainly perish. The image above is Counter-Strike's Iceworld, I should clarify, not the one in Straftat. That, you can see in the pics below.</p>

<p>Iceworld was a love-or-hate arena that was beautiful, panicky, and funny in its abstract simplicity. If there's a game where this map belongs in 2025, it is undoubtedly Straftat. Yes, some existing arenas in the shooter already feel a lot like Iceworld. But this is a truly unfettered reproduction. And there are a bunch of other variations on the same layout.</p><p>There's at least one other fun homage too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>'s <a href="https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/DM-MorbiasII">DM_Morbias</a> also makes an appearance, with its panopticon-like lobby inviting all into the embrace of death (did you know you can now also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-unreal-and-unreal-tournament-are-now-free-and-preserved-on-the-internet-archive">get Unreal Tournament for free</a> too?). There might be other mappy tributes in the big expandopack, but my arena shooter history fails me at this point. </p>

<p>The update also adds nine new weapons, including a katana and the Hill H15, an unusual prototype submachine gun from the 1950s that had a transparent magazine on the top. You can now also play a tutorial level, and set all the "active" maps you want into a playlist for more customised multiplayer shenanigans. All these additions and more are detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/764023363746136681">an update post</a> by developers Lemaitre Bros.</p>
<p>Straftat launched with 70 maps - but you could buy a DLC pack that added 70 more. With this update an extra three DLC maps have been added to that buyable expansion pack. And another seven maps got quietly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/2386720/announcements/detail/4453592738017837305?snr=2___">added back in November</a>. All this brings the total number of murder playgrounds to a vertigo-inducing 180. Probably more if I've missed a few "alt maps". That is wonderful. A playlist of death zones on shuffle. Or as our reviewer Rick Lane put it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">"an anarchic first-person speed dater"</a>. </p><p>As for Iceworld specifically, level designer Robert Yang once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">wrote a piece for us about the fan-made map's legacy</a>, comparing it to "the last desperate fight in the final circle of a battle royale, over and over". He even went in search of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-made-fy_iceworld-a-forensic-investigation">the map's original author</a>. If you're at all into mapping or just want to indulge in some multiplayer nostalgia, it's a good read. <strong><em>STRAFTAT!</em></strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Superhero card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has been taken offline in the USA as part of the US government's ban-or-divest policy towards ByteDance, the Chinese company best known for owning and operating shortform video-streaming service TikTok.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347034/marvel-snap-banned-tiktok-bytedance">The Verge</a>, mobile players in the US lost access to the Marvel Snap app without warning last Saturday, 18th January. The game is still listed on Steam, but people are reporting that they can't log in. California-based developers Second Dinner have promised, however, that it'll be playable again in the States within 24 hours.</p>
<p>To briefly fill in the background, the US government have a bone to pick with ByteDance because they think the company's various online services are a national security risk. TikTok is, of course, a mammoth international hit, used by 170 million people in the USA alone. The US Senate and other lawmakers argue that the platform is a means for the Chinese state to harvest details about US citizens, while using TikTok's algorithms to influence their views. TikTok insist that they harbour no such agenda, arguing that they only store US user data outside China in Singapore.</p>
<p>In a bill passed by the US Congress back in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/house-passes-bill-that-could-lead-to-a-tiktok-ban-fight-shifts-to-the-senate.html">March 2024</a>, representatives finally ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US-based company this month, or lose access to the entire US market. ByteDance have refused, taken the US government to court, and suspended access to TikTok after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-upheld-users-lose-access-starting-sunday-22383788/">their appeal was denied by the Senate</a>. As part of that, Marvel Snap - whose publisher Nuverse is owned by ByteDance - has been given the cosh. This appears to be a fleeting interruption, however.</p>
<p>"In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th," reads <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821">a tweet from this Sunday</a>. </p>
<p>"We've been working around the clock to bring MARVEL SNAP back up in the U.S. and hope to have it back online within 24 hours," <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881154403333521795">reads another tweet from about eight hours ago</a>. "We'll update you once it's back up. In the meantime, global players should be able to continue to play with no issues."</p><p>Confusingly, other Nuverse games such as Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary and Earth: Revival - Deep Underground are still available on the US App Store, according to the Verge. I'm not sure whether Second Dinner or Nuverse will need to wrangle with the US government to resurrect Marvel Snap. Perhaps it's more of an accidental, administrative knock-on effect from the TikTok ban.</p>
<p>While the TikTok outage doesn't affect the games industry directly, it's obviously significant news for tech in general and a nasty blow for video game streamers. People have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/treyq.bsky.social/post/3lfwv2f5vus2s">sorrowfully uploading</a> their best TikTok clips to other platforms. Fortunately, a deal appears to have been struck with the incoming administration and TikTok is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">now in the process of coming back online</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping you Marvel Snappers can resume snapping marvellously very soon. We've never reviewed the Steam edition, but Matt Cox (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-snap-will-speed-up-card-progression-on-january-31st">is/was a fan</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As much as I'd like to dredge up an old RPS tradition and write "Severance is back!" repeatedly for 500 words, I'll resist the urge and instead just slide a nice free game over to your side of the table, hidden underneath an inconspicuous pile of photocopies. <a href="https://tydes.itch.io/lumon">Lumon by Mark Gomersall</a> is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. <em>More</em> importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The idea here is that you colour match floating numbers with your mouse cursor before exporting them. It's neither challenging or exciting, but it is mildly meditative in the way that all highly repetitive drudgery is, and I imagine that's the point. The show's own macrodata refinement is itself a play on gamified busywork, complete with addictive-looking animated flourishes like a magnifying glass cursor and a satisfying crate-opening action. It's the archetypal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit job</a>, but with a lingering mystery to whether the data is actually significant in some way.</p>
<p>Lumon is the only game I've found that's a direct tribute to Severance, although there are a few others either inspired by the show or that inspired it directly.<a href="https://unnamedgamecompany.itch.io/fractured"> Fractured</a>, for one, is a TTRPG with a very similar concept. Creator Dan Erickson has also <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/severance-apple-tv-plus-interview-dan-erickson-ben-stiller-adam-scott">spoken about</a> the direct influence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> on the show. There are also approximately a scary number's worth of games based on creepypasta-adjacent Severance influence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">The Backrooms</a>.</p>
<p>As for the show, I need to sit with the latest episode a bit more, but I did enjoy it. There's a fun echo of the idea of capitalism subsuming critique in Lumon making the team's uprising part of its own corporate legend. Also, the camera work was immaculate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What's interesting here though is the developer TeamKill Media's reasoning for keeping their game away from your desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavills-good-but-hes-got-nothing-on-these-five-celebrity-pc-builds?view=comments">thinking telly</a>. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/01/code-violet-takes-aim-at-dinosaur-horror-in-june-on-ps5">Pushsquare</a>, Here's their <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541">post in full</a>:</p>
<p>"For those asking us about a PC version of Code Violet… the reason we are not bringing it to PC is we do not want anyone modding vulgar versions of the main character as well as other characters in the game. We hold our voice actresses and actors with high regard, as well as our artistic vision for the game and story and reject any form of destroying that with sexual mods. Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make."</p><p>I…don't know what to make of it, honestly. As far as reasoning goes, it isn't unprecedented. The talent agency for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgement</a> star Takuya Kimura <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-judgment-series-is-ending-over-pc-version-disag-1847271300">got in a tangle with SEGA</a> over not wanting to have the series ported to PC for similar reasons. In 2021,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cdpr-shuts-down-cyberpunk-mod-that-let-players-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves/"> CD Projekt shut down</a> a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077 </a>mod that reskinned a boneable joytoy to look like Keanu Reeves ("It's always nice when it's nice" was Reeves' own response.)</p>
<p>So, the wording of the tweet focusing on the actors might suggest a similar case of talent agency reticence to that of Judgement. And, hey, if this is genuinely a case of a developer sticking to their guns about their vision for their work to the point where it excludes an entire massive market, then fair play. They <em>probably</em> could have worded in such a way that doesn't suggest the entire PC owning market is a bunch of slavering boob goblins. But then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-mod-jimbos-big-naturals-is-a-lot-funnier-and-safer-for-work-than-it-sounds">Jimbo's Big Naturals</a> suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Teamkill previously released dino FPS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200540/Son_and_Bone/">Son and Bone</a> to Steam. The only mod I could find was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/sonandbone?tab=latest">this one</a>, which removes the splash screen. Maybe they're just really, really proud of Code Violet's splash screen?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
