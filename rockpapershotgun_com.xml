            <p>You'd think Talha and Jack Co would have earned themselves a nice custard cream and a sit down after having just released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero </a>last September, but they're back already with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/mashina">crowdfunder for Mashina</a> - a robo-stuffed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> where you'll "Dig, build, discover and mend in a chill, stop-motion world." Now I think about, you could probably eat quite a lot of custard creams in five months, although less so if you were using your hands to build model robots. Have a trailer. It's got robots in it.</p>

<p>A very nice, digital press release with zero custard cream crumbs on it tells me that Mashina is based around "positive verbs" like 'build', 'nurture', 'discover', 'mend', and 'bomb'. It uses traditional stop motion capture with digital techniques, and the music is a tribute to Gamecube-era soundtracks, with the same synth used in Metroid Prime. "Warm and crunchy digital baths" is the phrased used, which I enjoy immensely. Track below. Jack's games always have such fantastic music.</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395930/Mashina/">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Dig to excavate rare minerals.</li>
<li>Build helpful machines to aid your excavations</li>
<li>Find robot pals, treasures, trinkets and more</li>
<li>Meet locals and get missions</li>
<li>Decorate your surroundings</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Kickstarter is very close to its £12,000 goal already, but still has around 3 weeks to go. If you've got a spare £500, you can even get yourself your own robot. They are very nice robots but I reckon I could probably draw a face on a dustbin lid and spend the rest on chips and Ric Flair action figures and a utility bill or two and be roughly as content. Again though, very nice robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it's a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It's a free splitscreen pixelart heist oddity in which two ninjas race to be the first to loot a daimyo's castle. While scouring the mansion in your half of the screen, you can lay traps and obstacles for the rival shinobi. If push comes to shove comes to roundhouse kick, you can also fight them directly.</p>
<p>It's kind of nifty. It looks like it's from the 80s. Here's a video.</p>

<p>I had a play just now and can (re)confirm that I suck at being a ninja. In my defence, I Narutoed straight into <a href="https://mausimus.itch.io/efcm">the Itch.io browser edition</a> without even glancing at the control scheme. Impetuosity is not one of the ninja virtues, I gather. There's probably an ancient ninja proverb about always reading the manual. Still, it was calming to watch my bot opponent gracefully case the joint while I loitered menacingly in a hallway, trying to find the smoke bomb button.</p><p>You may fare better. Perhaps you'd like to up the stakes and challenge a friend, even - there's online, LAN and same-computer multiplayer, according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490030/Escape_From_Castle_Matsumoto/">Steam page</a>. The developers are <a href="https://mausimus.net/">mausimus</a> and Chris "Joker" Femo. Good for them, I say. We can always do with more ninja games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-will-fall">All Will Fall</a> are pariahs, as far as I'm concerned. You should warn your children to avoid them. If you encounter them in the street, you should jerk away with a muttered oath, making a sign to avert evil spirits - for these are the scumbags who've decided to develop a city-building game in which all the buildings and building materials are subject to realworld physics. A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.</p><p>"Playing Jenga with human lives" is how they summarise it, the wastrels. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The premise is that the world is being swallowed by the ocean. You lead a small boatload of wild-eyed survivors, searching for the last few scraps of land to found a civilisation on. Having located a few sparse tiles of solid footing, you must wrestle with a physics-based building system that "challenges you to consider real-world construction aspects when building your intricate multi-level city in all three dimensions".</p><p>Everything you build may collapse, pancaking the civvies inside, unless it's delicately stacked and balanced. Do not construct your city like you're absent-mindedly filling a shopping trolley at Tescos, with soft fruits carefully placed in the bottom and 20 family-sized tins of bratwurst heaped on top. Exercise discretion. "There is a high-risk, high-reward aspect to it," the Steam page adds. "For example, you can find various ways to reach much-needed resource nodes by building elaborate bridges or ladders. Or - save some space for more production by stacking the housing quarters on top of each other."</p>
<p>All this, and you still have to tackle the traditional post-apocalytic mayoral dilemma of whether to be a kindly custodian who causes everybody to perish of malnutrition, or a ruthless tyrant who secures overall survival at the cost of being universally despised. There are three survivor factions, each with different skills - Engineers can operate cranes, Sailors can sail boats, and Workers handle anything that isn't a boat or a crane, I guess. Factions have wants and needs: you likely won't be able to satisfy them all, so it's a good thing you can impose martial law to shut up the moaners.</p>
<p>I'm not clear on how complex All Will Fall <em>really</em> is when you discount the risk of towns accidentally flattening themselves, but the social and story elements sound quite labyrinthine. "Each colony you build will deal with unique challenges, foundation layouts, circumstances and random events - like storms, mysterious structures emerging from the ocean, political coups, unexpected newcomers, food shortages, and more," the developers hint. "Learn from your mistakes, unlock new locations on the global map, and embark on the next dangerous adventure once the inevitable calamity comes to destroy the city."</p>
<p>All mock-outrage aside, this sounds brilliant. I'm absurdly bad at Jenga and look forward to making a very short-lived Tower of Babel out of driftwood. All Will Fall is out this year, and you can sign up to a public playtest on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2706020/ALL_WILL_FALL_PhysicsBased_Survival_City_Builder/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Celeste and Towerfall creators Extremely OK Games have announced the cancellation of their pixelart exploration platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, in what studio director Maddy Thorson calls a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.</p><!--more-->
<p>Extremely OK <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-developers-next-game-is-called-earthblade">announced Earthblade back in 2021</a> with Celeste composer Lena Raine handling the soundtrack. A proper reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">followed in 2022</a> with a smidgeon of plot information: the game would have seen you playing a "child of Fate", exploring a ruined planet. In March last year, Thorson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-creators-next-game-earthblade-wont-be-out-this-year-but-studio-assure-development-is-not-stagnant">blogged about development difficulties</a> but assured readers that the team were making progress. That brings us to today. It sounds like last year has been more complicated than she originally divulged.</p>
<p>Posting on Extremely OK's <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">website</a>, Thorson writes that a "fracture" formed last year between herself and Berry and co-founder Pedro Medeiros, who was Earthblade's art director and pixel/UI artist for Celeste and Towerfall.</p>
<p>"The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste, which we won't be detailing publicly - this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process," she explains. "We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">Neverway</a>, which you should check out - we've played it and it's very promising."</p><p>Pedro's departure prompted Berry and Thorson to think hard about the status of Earthblade as a whole. "The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process," Thorson continues. "I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p>
<p>"But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."</p>
<p>Thorson is careful to spell out that Medeiros is not to blame for all this - his leaving simply created "the clarity to see that we have lost our way". She adds that "if you were excited about Earthblade and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren't the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn't welcome in any EXOK community."</p>
<p>As part of the cancellation, Thorson and Berry have parted ways with the other members of the Earthblade team - that's <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@amora">Amora</a>, <a href="http://kylepulver.com/">Kyle Pulver</a>, <a href="http://ikenfell.com/">Chevy Ray</a>, <a href="https://lena.fyi/">Raine</a> and sound design company <a href="https://powerupaudio.com/">Power-Up Audio</a> - though they hope to collaborate with them again.</p><p>"Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned from Earthblade, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects," Thorson goes on. "We're prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception." </p>
<p>She concludes that "scaling the core team up post-Celeste has ultimately been a failure, and that's okay. We gave it all we've got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."</p>
<p>I confess, I still haven't found time to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-review">magnificent-sounding</a> Celeste, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-towerfall-ascension">same-screen archery frenzy</a> of Towerfall was an office lunchbreak favourite when I worked at Future London. We'd gather round a monitor and mostly fall victim to our own arrows while hooting like baby elephants. Clearly the people who made that game are geniuses. I wish Extremely OK and the departing Earthblade team members better luck with their future creations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
