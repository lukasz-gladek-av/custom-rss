            <p>Video game voice-actor union <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> are launching a legal case against the presence of generated AI voice-acting for Darth Vader in Epic's battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. They're accusing the company's subsidiary Llama Productions of using AI to "replace the work of human performers" - or at least, of replacing human performers without first haggling out terms with the union.</p><!--more-->
<p>The AI-voiced Vader character was added to Fortnite last week, in collaboration with the family of James Earl Jones, the original voice of Darth. Track down and recruit him and you'll be able to take turns generatively bantering with Fauxnakin. Needless to say, the addition has proven a hit among the furiously masticating hamsters of social media. Also needless to say, players have swiftly worked out how to bait DAIrth VAIder into <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">dropping F-bombs 
and slurs</a>, though at the time of publication, Epic appear to have addressed this in a patch.</p>
<p>Now, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have filed <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">an unfair labour practice charge</a> against SkAIwalker Senior with the US National Labor Relations Board.</p>
<p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles," the union wrote in a statement. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.</p>
<p>"Fortnite's signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with A.I. technology," it continues. "Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms. As such, we have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB against Llama Productions."</p>
<p>The court document itself claims that Llama Productions have "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite".</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA - who represent a spectrum of workers across the media and entertainment sphere - have often gone to bat with the video games industry over the usage of human voice-acting to "train" bots, and the potential replacing of voice-acting in games with genAI. Following a lengthy negotiation over AI protections with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher Take-Two and Call Of Duty household Activision, they called a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">strike last July</a> in the name of "fair compensation and the right of informed consent". The strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">continues</a>. Some video game voice and performance artists have, however, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">criticised</a> SAG-AFTRA for striking deals with individual genAI companies.</p>
<p>All this forms part of the wider, on-going debate about the ethics and legalities of generative AI - our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares</a> essay series remains a good primer. While voice actors contest the loss of work, other organisations are picking fights with the genAI biz over copyright infringement.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite?lang=en-US">an Epic Games blog post</a>, the Darth Vader chatbot in Fortnite makes use of two AI models - Google's Gemini and ElevenLabs' Flash. Gemini was recently hit by a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/business/google-hit-with-271m-fine-over-gemini-ai-tool-copyright-breach/">$271 million fine over copyright breach</a>, with France's competition watchdog accusing the search engine company of "training" the bot with material from publishers and news agencies without notifying them. Google have pledged not to contest these facts as part of settlement proceedings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After many months of dogged campaigning in the face of zealotry, atrocity and propaganda about fake WMDs, the heroic avatars of the Illuminate have finally invaded Super-Earth. In just a few short days, the humans and their fanatical and clownish "Helldiver" enforcers may be wiped from the face of the galaxy, ushering in a brave new era in which the surviving bots, bugs and squids link clamps, mandibles and tentacles and dance around singing. You ever hear an Illuminate sing? Literally mind-blowing.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Heart Of Democracy update is upon us, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-enemy-squids-are-headed-to-super-earth-so-now-you-can-tinker-with-your-guns-more">teasers earlier this month</a>. It lets the game's sordid playerbase of perfidious human stormtroopers blow the shit out of some ace nano-tech molluscs on the streets of planet Earth. The new Earth maps are also full of NPC human soldiers who can be left to fight for themselves or enlisted as cannon fodder. There are crowds of panicking civilians, too. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/20/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-live-brings-the-fight-to-the-streets-of-super-earth/">PlayStation blog post</a> announcing the update's release suggests that you'll be "punished" for accidentally shooting them, but that's not the impression given by the below orgiastic trailer.

"Last week, we released a powerful primary weapon customization system and expanded surplus options to fight against the Illuminate as they emerged from the singularity," adds the PlayStation blog. "Now that you have learned the tactics of these new squid troops - like the Crescent Overseer and the hulking Fleshmob - you must master these tools to continue the fight on Super Earth. Use every available resource, divers, and decimate their forces!"
</p>
<p>
Those newly customisable primary weapons aren't the beefiest bullet-throwers you'll find on Super Earth's streets. There are planetary defence cannons that must be woken from their slumber and turned against the majestic Illuminate fleets, lest they succeed in bringing about a future in which the brutality and idiocy of the human race is just a bedtime story for wide-eyed space plankton.</p>
<p>Let the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> enjoy turning their own cities into battlezones, I say. Let the strutting caped vermin relish the spectacle of their own ruination. As for us squid sympathisers in the shadows, let's all cross our tentacles and pray that the flag-fellating bipeds are unambiguously vanquished. Framing jokes aside, it would free Arrowhead up to work on their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-are-great-says-arrowheads-ceo-but-whatever-the-helldivers-2-devs-are-making-next-its-fully-self-funded">unannounced new game</a>.
