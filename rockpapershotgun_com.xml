            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sniper-at-work">Sniper At Work</a> is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179260/Kingdoms_Merge__Build/">"soothing merge-2 experiences"</a> featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only "twos" you shall be "merging" in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only "cherries" you shall be "picking" are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.</p>
<p>You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-29">the Maw</a> that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here". Right, that's enough quotation marks for one article. There won't be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here's the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3452800/Sniper_at_Work/">the Steam page</a>. Elevator pitch: this is a stealthy-sandboxy urban execution sim with changeable environments and a heavy emphasis on both planning and plans going awry. Why are you in an elevator? Because you are heading to the roof with your rifle, of course. Mind the CCTV. Here are some features.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tactical Planning: Scout your targets, choose your vantage points, and get creative with traps, distractions, and tools.</p>
<p>Precision Sniping: Feel the thrill of the perfect shot with realistic ballistics, wind physics, and breathing control.</p>
<p>Upgradable Arsenal: Unlock and customize sniper rifles, gadgets, and tools to handle any situation--or make them worse in the most entertaining way possible.</p>
<p>Dynamic Scenarios: Missions adapt to your decisions (and occasional missteps), keeping keeping every playthrough unpredictable.</p>
<p>Creative Freedom: Choose your approach--subtle, explosive, or delightfully ridiculous--and leave your mark in style.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not wholly convinced by the switches to elevated third-person in the trailer. I can't figure out how they fit into the rest of the game. Beyond that, yeah, more of this please. It's not as conceptually ambitious as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a>, and the developers have an uphill challenge crafting scenarios as ingenious as those of Hitman, let alone besting a direct rival like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sniper-elite-5-review">Sniper Elite</a>, but it feels like a game you shouldn't turn your back on. Especially given that it doesn't have a release date yet. They could strike at any moment.</p>
<p>Cherrypick Games are also working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949910/ANGST_A_TALE_OF_SURVIVAL/">Angst: A Tale Of Survival</a>, which is a low-poly trudge through an icy wilderness. The only cherries you shall pick here are chunks of frozen firewood.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are those ripples in your morning cappuccino? Must be the stomping feet of an ancient lizard messing up that nice whippy heart your barista made in the froth. And when I say "ancient" I mean from 1999. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> and Dino Crisis 2 have appeared on GOG, making the classic survival horror games easily (and legally) playable on the PC once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">a bundle with both games</a>, or you can get <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">the timid puzzles and exploration of the first game</a> separately from the more <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2">action-heavy shotgun blasting of the sequel</a>. Both are good times if you're a fan of digital fossils. Although if you're a console dabbler you may have already spotted these on the PlayStation store in October last year. </p>
<p>Both games have passed through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">GOG's "game preservation" process</a>, which is basically a set of performance tests and checks that GOG like to do to make sure the games are DRM-free, compatible with modern machinery, and straightforward to launch for modern players. They get a shiny sticker when they pass. The original Resident Evil trilogy appeared on GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">one</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc">one</a> (by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-3-is-now-available-via-gog-following-the-arrivals-of-its-predecessors">one</a>) via the same process.

</p><p>One side effect of remastering Dino Crisis 2 seems to be that the characters are very crisp, making its pre-rendered backgrounds look blurry by comparison. It's as if Regina here is in a zoom call with the background slightly blurred. </p>

</figure>
<p>But look, here's some of the things each game has to make sure they'll work well on your PC.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11</li>
<li>New rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more).</li>
<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock 4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series, etc.) with optimal button mapping for both wired and wireless modes, including hot plugging.</li>
<li>Added Cloud Saves support.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dino Crisis is the well-liked cousin of the Resident Evil games, but has long been neglected by Capcom in comparison to the zombie-blasting series. Capcom released a poll that showed the series has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">a lot of nostalgic fans</a>. But there has been no real sign of any remake happening in the style of the Resi games. Even Shinji Mikami has said that there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">"no room" for the series to get a reboot when Monster Hunter exists</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, GOG took this moment to remind people about their <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/">"Dreamlist"</a>, a list of user-voted games people would like to see appear on the store (they're touting this as a new feature but it is essentially a nice-looking revamp of their previous "wishlist" which saw users do the same thing). Currently, another Capcom game of yore is high on the list - Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/Peripeteia">Peripeteia </a>feels like what I'd get if I asked a wasp to describe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> to me. It has sharp, insectoid qualities. Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">immersive sim</a> offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone's car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was <em>writing on the sky</em> and I realised it was a roof. I'm still messed up about it, honestly.</p>

<p>The freakbot's dialogue is all casually hyper-detailed cyberpunk patois. Slick and bitty. This feels like a world with depth sinking into itself. Hell yeah I'm into it.</p>
<p>He gives me an augmentation that lets me dilate time. It is made of bones. This is the most amount of spine I've had in an inventory for ages, and it's even got a skull attached. Also, a silenced rifle. I'm off to the planetarium to do a task for the bot in exchange for info. The city feels almost oceanic in its blues and greens and silvers, and also because there's a lot of piss and garbage in it. There's also maybe a tiny sliver of piss in the code. It's all a bit choppy but I'm treating that as text for now. The city is vast. A necropolis no-one bothered to show up to after death that now just feels incredibly dejected and morose about the whole thing.</p><p>I never make it to the planetarium. The city goes too deep and I want to see the bottom of it. You will probably make more progress than me. I need to luxuriate with this thing. It's the kind of cyberpunk I like. Human thought and conciousness? I barely noosphere. There's a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1437760/Peripeteia/">on Steam here</a>.</p>
<p>Rick Lane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gaming-is-on-the-verge-of-an-immersive-sim-eruption">chatted to the devs</a> for RPS a while back:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I want to immerse the player in a world of propaganda and perspective," says Snake, one of the games two leads. "A place where belief, ideology, and demons of the past meet in a cyber future." But this is filtered through Poland's unique history. "The game will in places explore elements of Polish culture of the 19th and 20th Century," says the game's programming lead Shodanon, including "Polish messianism, the work of Polish modernists, the anti-communist movements".</p></blockquote>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peripeteia">Peripeteia</a> is out in early access on February 21, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
