            <p>The creator of frying pan simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, Sega Bass Fishing, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a>, says developer The Water Museum in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbkxvnpxmc2o">post on Bluesky</a>. It may have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1870901507857817795">a splash</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1880394328885063771">a strange man</a> might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1881521452324954221">turn completely red</a>. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That is the sum of what I learned from a cursory creep upon The Water Museum's social media feeds. Though it may be a deeper hole than I can account for. There are hints that you might be selling your fish or buying things <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1867366841602936854">at a stall</a> (or maybe just chatting to the lady who works there?). You might have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1868098692450066667">branching conversations</a> with some of the folks you encounter. It is, we are told, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1883567851661070599">"not a horror game"</a>. </p>
<p>As I've mentioned in other posts, I enjoy seeing devs share their ongoing progress, even if the stuff they're showing off will likely change in big and small ways. It also means you get to see the fun bugs. Like this attempt to implement <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbx56ugr7s22">"triple-A immersive wall-touching technology"</a>. </p>
<p>Again, this is early days. But I am taking note. A previous demo for another short game by the same developer, <a href="https://the-water-museum.itch.io/eating-nature-demo-playtest">Eating Nature</a>, sees you playing as a big-eyed fish yourself, swimming in a small pond and leaping haplessly onto the rocks in an attempt to catch and eat ants that come to slurp at the water's edge. It's a very small prototypey thing, but features the same crispy, low-resolution visual style of their previous game, Arctic Eggs.</p><p>Fish would appear from time to time in your frying pan in that game too, alongside eggs, bacon, cigarettes, cockroaches, and other delicacies. We didn't review the game at RPS, because we are a dwindling sack of mortals whose fingertips wear closer to the bone with every passing day. But I did play it and found it to be a fine example of strong NPC dialogue. Remember when you'd walk around an RPG town and everyone would have just one comically short line, entirely bespoke to them? It's like that. Except everyone lives in a concrete polar apartment complex and some of them are prisoners and also they yearn for cooked shards of glass. Don't overthink it. It's normal to enjoy a bit of glass. </p>
<p>No idea when the fishing game is coming out, or even what it will be called. This is okay. These are the regular stages of creation. Weep if you must, but your feelings are irrelevant. We may choose to tell you when we learn anything of actual importance. Or we may not. Goodbye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hidden away on NASA's <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/voyager-golden-record/">Golden Record</a>, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, <a href="https://fleursdumal.org/poem/102">Élévation</a>, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

I'm shamelessly piggybacking on my own academic research here. But look, it's on point. Three Verses is a grid-based first-person "typing RPG" in which you help poets finish their poems by asking various gods to supply the concluding line. "You" being a disembodied soul seeking elevation from a purgatory of royalty-free, PS1-style spaces - washed, pixel-scabbed streets tormented by metronomic trains, interiors made up of soiled slabs and motel doors. Not vast, but certainly sorrowful and vexing. Oh, and hovering synthwave mazes. And minigames featuring bubbled green cats and chunky dice. Your equipment consists of a pop-up organiser for note-taking, with phrases manually typed in. Typing is also how you'll cast spells during simple turn-based battles with creatures like door-blocking gargoyles.

<p>
The poems themselves - all awaiting recombination, with no apparent opportunity to improvise or deviate - aren't original to Three Verses. As detailed on <a href="https://d-mag.itch.io/three-verses">the Itch page</a>, which includes a free version of the game, they're lifted from Brion Gysin's Permuted Poems and Robert Ashley's TV performance Perfect Lives: an opera, among other texts. As such, the game is something of a restless archive that triangulates some interesting links between various literary traditions, a cousin of the Golden Record that, again, invites the recipient to resolve or toy with the gaps. I played about 30 minutes of the Itch demo yesterday and got stuck on a puzzle involving sewer valves. I'd like to play more, perhaps after it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139120/THREE_VERSES/">launches on Steam</a>. Now, what would be the most obvious and obnoxious way to finish this article. Ah, of cour
