            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was never a game that was going to win me over, as I generally only like single-player shooters if any, but it isn't helped by the fact that since its announcement there hasn't been a lick of actual marketing to help it prove itself. This, of course, has been the subject of much discourse, to which I will contribute slightly in the coming paragraphs, but the main point of all this is to say that actually, against all odds, Highguard is in fact sticking to its January 26th launch date, and will even show off some gameplay… on its release day.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a singular Dweet on the game's Dwitter account, explaining the following: "Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase. Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more." You'll note Devolver Digital being its usual cheeky self in the replies asking if the devs need a publisher; "There's still time."

Now, I don't care to be marketed to, excessively, moderately, or conservatively, the last of which is still generous in Highguard's case. It's just I can't tell if releasing a game after one trailer is an act of supreme hubris, well-placed confidence, or riding on the assumption that it being from the creators of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. I have to wonder if developer Wildlight Entertainment thought that such a pedigree was enough in this pre-established property-led world we live in.
</p>
<p>
Highguard might have some old guard talent, but we don't live in the same world as film, plastering names over trailers of other games doesn't suggest guaranteed quality, it invites comparison. Games have to prove themselves in the pudding, and so far on most counts Highguard hasn't done a very good job of that. The only benefit it currently has is all of this technically bad (absent) PR might make enough people curious enough to play it, and it is free so that's easy enough to do. Guess we'll find out in a week or so!
