            <p>If the surprising number of you brought scurrying out of the woodwork by the announcement of Redwall-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawthorne">Hawthorn</a> is anything to go by, the medieval rodent fanatic to RPS reader pipeline is a sturdy one, despite being constantly nibbled at. Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/mossflower-tw">Mossflower TW</a> is a campaign mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war">Medieval II: Total War</a> expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by. Here’s a video by YouTuber Tharshey so you can see it in action:</p>

<p>Modder <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/flesheatingbeans">FleshEatingBeans</a> describes Mossflower TW as “a campaign themed around the titular Redwall novel”. I’m not sure exactly how many different beasties you’ll be able to recruit, but at a glance, I count mice, hedgehogs, otters and…wait! That’s not an otter at all. It’s a weasel! Typical weasel behaviour. You’ll also get more beasts on your side as you liberate settlements. There are two factions to choose from: the pirates of Cluny the Scourge, or Redwall Abbey.</p>
<p>“We seek to follow the world presented in the books, audiobooks and an animated show as closely as reasonable,” says Mr. Beans, “while adding canon-friendly content of our own to fill out gaps and up the fun factor”. Alongside the units, there are custom structures, and also some custom banners.</p><p>The team were on hiatus, but seem to be back now. Such is the allure of several different types of battling mammal where only one type of less-interesting mammal - the lowly human - existed previously. There's a bird of some sort too, but who cares about that guy. You can find the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/mossflower-tw/downloads/mossflower-last-feb-build">latest build here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
