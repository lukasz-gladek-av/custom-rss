            <p>Copper golems and new types of copper equipment are coming in the next big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> update, which is available to test now in Minecraft Bedrock and available shortly as a Snapshot for the Java edition. The golems actually date back to Minecraft's 2021 Mob Vote - players cruelly snubbed them in favour of the musical, item-fetching Allay. Classic case of robophobia, if you ask me. What can some fairy jukebox junkie do that a golem can't. Luckily for you nay-sayers, Mojang have seen fit to add the oxidisable automatons to Minecraft anyway, in keeping with the idea that Mob Vote outcomes are more of a guide for development than a rigid prescription.</p><!--more-->
<p>As and when you get access to the update, you'll build golems by planting a jack-o-lantern or carved pumpkin atop a block of copper. This, to my understanding, is how the good Lord created Adam in the Garden of Eden, except that Adam did not immediately start going through the Good Lord's treasure chests within a set range and organising them by item.</p>
<p>A copper golem is, in other words, a housekeeper. It'll ensure that each goodie you craft is stored in the same place. I look forward to the complaints from players who've had to start over because all of their diamond equipment has been industriously shuffled into some random cellar. I also like the idea of these worlds outlasting their creators and becoming a ceaseless hive of Mary Poppinbots. As with other copper items in Mojang's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, the golems will corrode over time and develop a charming green patina, though this doesn't affect their operation.</p>
<p>Copper in general will be more useful as of this updating. It's now an equipment tier, whose "durability sits somewhere between stone and iron", according to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-new-friend-with-a-familiar-patina">the official Minecraft website</a>. Apparently, "a copper pickaxe will help you mine a bit faster and for a bit longer than a stone pickaxe but won't allow you to mine any additional materials - you'll still need to upgrade to iron for that." Being already abundant in Minecraft's generated worlds, it's "the perfect early-game material".</p>
<p>In case you have been skulking in a Creeper hole these past 10 years and missed the acquisition, Mojang and Minecraft are currently owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are about to announce another round of mass layoffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lstr3pbp3k2x">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. If this does come to pass, the irony of it accompanying the addition of a new robot workforce to Minecraft will be <em>just</em> pressing enough to retrospectively justify me mentioning it here. Fingers crossed that Schreier is wrong.</p><hr>
<p><em>Before joining RPS, our news editor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote a book about Minecraft's history in collaboration with Mojang and Microsoft. He's not receiving any royalties or similar on-going payments.</em>

        <p>Site founder says these changes would have come regardless of switch in ownership</p>

            <p>Nexus Mods is set to introduce age verification for folks in the UK and EU attempting to gander at NSFW add-ons, as part of incoming changes to how the site handles mods containing adult or "illegal" content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319?BH=6">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl outlined that these changes are being made in response to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">UK’s Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>, along with guidance being issued by UK regulator Ofcom. Site founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott has commented on the post in an effort to reassure users that these policy adjustments aren't a result of Nexus Mods' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-announce-ownership-change-but-the-folks-taking-over-remain-a-bit-mysterious">recent change in ownership</a>, and would have had to happen regardless.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>UK and EU users will need to verify their ages when accessing "the majority of adult content hosted on the site". "The specifics of this are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website," SlugGirl wrote.</p>
<p>This change won't affect users outside of the UK and EU, however, unless your country passes legislation that requires it.</p>
<p>Nexus say that this and the raft of other tweaks outlined in the post are the result of being given the choice of doing this and getting rid of adult content for UK and EU users entirely. As founder Scott, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-new-owner-is-a-company-whose-co-founder-has-already-had-to-reassure-folks-that-nfts-and-crypto-arent-incoming">recently passed Nexus Mods on to new owners Chosen</a>, put it in his comment: "the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</p>
<p>"For the people who think this is the fault of the new owners of Nexus Mods," he went on, "please either read the news post above properly or read up on the laws around child safety online that are coming to every major western country either this month, or in the coming year (including most states in the US).</p>
<p>"Whoever owned Nexus Mods, whether it was still me or the new ownership, would have had to have dealt with it this year no matter what. Frankly, I'm relieved that it is not me who has to deal with this or be responsible for the content on the site directly because I have some big misgivings about how it is being enforced. However, if it was me, I would still have followed the letter of the law, and I'd have been doing what is written above. Because I'd have to."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>sabbath7991/CD Projekt</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for what else is changing, while Nexus Mods makes clear that some the details are "still being worked out behind the scenes", they've outlined a raft of planned revisions for the site's approach to illegal content, categorisation and tags for adult content, together with changes to the block and mute systems.</p>
<p>As far as illegal stuff, the site's Terms of Service'll be updated with a "more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site". The site will also automatically take down material depicting child sexual abuse, as well as banning uploaders and reporting them to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nexus Mods are introducing revised tags for mods that contain legal adult content, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pornographic</li>
<li>Extreme Violence</li>
<li>Harmful substances</li>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Self-harm</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Body stigma</li>
<li>Eating disorders</li>
<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>
<li>Sexualised</li>
</ul>
<p>"These tags can be added by our moderators and staff and will be locked in place once added," Nexus Mods explained, "Of course, this does not change the ability mod authors have to tag their mods and users' ability to vote on tags." You'll be able to filter out mods according to these tags if you don't want to see them, just as you currently can with mods tagged adult.</p>
<p>While it's easy to see the logic behind most of these changes, the lack of detail regarding the form of the new age verification and what sorts of personal data it might ask for has left some Nexus Mods users with lingering questions. There's also the matter of the site not having yet outlined in-depth what sorts of mods its new tags will encompass.</p>
<p>The likes of suicide seem pretty self-explanatory, but extreme violence and depression are a bit more vague, as well as being things a lot of the base games you might mod include or depict in some form. Swearing and profanity could also be very complicated to police, given that different words fall under those categories depending on where you are in the world.</p>
<p>"Some of these changes are live already and will be detailed in the next monthly roundup, while others will roll out gradually over the coming weeks and months," SlugGirl wrote to round out the post. "We’ll do our best to make the transition as smooth as possible, but we understand this may cause some disruption."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What <em>is</em> an indie game? Is a self-published game an indie game? Is a game with a small team size an indie game? Is it an indie game if it makes you go "oooo, haven't seen that before"? I got a letter this morning that made me feel slightly wistful but with undertones of mercurial optimism. Is the concept of post, therefore, an indie game? Are you ok? You're looking a bit pixelated this morning. Are <em>you</em> an indie game?</p>

<p>Was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver</a> an indie game? The 2023 Geoffrey H. Video Game Awards seemed to think so when it nominated the happy management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> for its 'best independent game' category. "Fie and fuckleberries on that!" came the response. "That's funded by Nexon! They're massive! Also, Nexon's Vice President even said "it may look like an indie, but it’s not necessarily so" in <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">an interview</a>. Case closed, Geoffles!"</p>
<p>The case was not closed. Much online out-loud thinking occurred. Thinkpieces fluttered from the sky like Yuletide's first crisp yellow snow. Then forty five full minutes passed and everyone forgot about it and started arguing about Ebert again.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>), Mintrocket CEO and Dave The Diver director Jaeho Hwang addressed 2023's hottest much-ado with a firm nope.</p><p>

"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang says, via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dave-the-diver-director-says-theres-nothing-indie-about-hit-game">NintendoLife</a>. "It's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".

</p><p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team," he continued, "or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang went on to point out how The Game Awards' nomination system works. Namely, that it's chosen by over 100 international games media outlets (not us, afaik) - devs and publishers can't submit games themselves. These parties aren't made aware of nominated games in advance either, Automaton point out. "Independent is a broad term" host Geoff Keighley said at the time. "It can mean different things to different people". As can <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">$250k for a minute of airtime</a>, presumably.</p>
<p>Anyway, my main feeling from back then hasn't changed: Dave The Diver is a great time regardless, and using games as cudgels to police arbitrary categories does them a disservice. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-gets-godzilla-dlc">It's got Godzilla in it and everything</a>. Phwoar. There's a big lizard if I ever saw one, our Godzilla.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-director-finally-puts-2023s-silliest-debate-to-rest-no-its-not-an-indie]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Publishers Krafton have removed multiple senior staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds in a sudden shift that swaps the leadership team for a single head honcho from the studio who made sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. It's not clear why. At Unknown Worlds, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and technical director Max MacGuire have all been "replaced" by Steve Papoutsis, CEO at Striking Distance, the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-ish game. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Papoutsis replaces the previous leadership team—Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire—effective immediately," said Krafton in <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">a press release</a>. "While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors."</p>
<p>Well, that's ominous. Papoutsis, the man being installed by Krafton, was an executive producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-3">Dead Space 3</a>. He became a higher-up on Callisto Protocol, the would-be spiritual successor to those spacey horror games, and eventually CEO of the studio, replacing Glen Schofield. I say "would-be" because the game famously ran like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">a stuttering jelly on an old train</a> when it came out on PC. </p>
<p>"I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the Krafton family," said Papoutsis, "and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the Subnautica community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience."</p>
<p>The decision is unexpected to say the least. Subnautica 2 is due to release some time this year into early access, and the studio has been increasingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-teases-new-creatures-and-co-op-among-the-coral">showing off its subaquatic setting</a> in developer blogs and promising <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-will-have-a-bigger-map-and-a-silent-protagonist-say-devs">a bigger world of wetness</a> than in previous games. Given such proximity to launch, the choice to suddenly boot several senior members of staff, including a founder who has been at the company for 24 years, shortly before the game is set to launch, is pretty wild. </p>
<p>It's not yet clear if other developers have also been laid off, or if this is a limited shake-up resulting from a long-term problem between developer and publisher. But none of it looks reassuring. I've reached out to contacts at Unknown Worlds for comment.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If there's one thing I love doing first thing in the morning, it's launching myself into a festively atrocious trench network, where gasmasks glare from the offal like toppled gargoyles, and sea mines dangle overhead like enormous germ cells. Here be monsters. Here be dropped diary pages. Here be a tormenting combo of "handcrafted" characters and permadeath. Here be, er, minigames.</p>
<p>"A grimdark machine for martyrdom, fed by flesh and devotion," is how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-hope-voiden">In Hope Voiden</a> describes itself. In this first-person survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, you are 12 people in succession, each laden with baggage of one kind or another, each trying to make sense of a rusty hellmouth that marries the grot of World War 1 to the grain of PS1. It's the work of German team Stilbruch Games. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The retro aesthetics might sound tedious on paper. There are a lot of PS1-style horror games. But this one grabs me both for the density and peculiarity of its setting - is that a stained glass window, deep in the catacombs? - and for the ensemble format. "Each individual has a personal mission, unique traits, and only one life," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/">the Steam page</a> goes on. "Every action matters. Every failure lingers. When one life ends, another takes its place. The world remembers. The horror deepens."</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the pasts and motivations of the character in hand, you will also "discover the truth of a place where war broke reality". The blurb writing is perhaps a bit over-the-top in the non-World-War sense, though I absolutely don't have the right to complain about this after penning that line about the germ cells. Hopefully the in-game lore is sparser and subtler. Let those gnashing textures speak for themselves, I say.</p>
<p>You might expect the minigames to be a refreshing distraction from all the misery, a touch of match-3 to cheer you up when you're, I don't know, picking ghost shrapnel from your thighs. Fool! The minigames are all part of the plan! They are the grimdarkest bits of all!</p>
<p>"Lighting a flare. Bandaging a wound. Forcing a door. Enemies don't wait. Your mistakes cost you time. And time costs lives," summarises the Steam page. There also appears to be combat, or at least, there is a brief glimpse in the trailer of somebody firing a gun at something ghastly, but I'm not expecting this to be any kind of shooter. That gun is probably going to fill you with undeserved confidence and get you gnawed and despoiled by mutant trench rats.</p>
<p>Parallel-wise, I guess this is the lumbering, corner-peeking lovechild of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. It has no release date, only the ominous prediction that it is "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-torrid-trench-dimension-as-12-perma-killable-lost-souls-in-this-amnesia-style-horror-shooter]]></content:encoded>
