            <p>The new MMO from the Elder Scrolls Online developers would reportedly have been a sci-fi noir affair in which players swing around tall buildings on grappling lines, and do aerial dashes while shooting and looting. Call it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> Spider-Man. Call it Destiny 2077. Call it whatever you like, frankly, because it has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">abandoned</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at parent company Microsoft</a>, the outfit that made tens of billions of dollars in profit this past financial quarter, yet has decided to jettison thousands of staff in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">"discipline" and "continued success"</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">Bloomberg</a>, where Jason Schreier offers a brief account of the Blackbird project's final hours. Previously codenamed Kestrel, it had apparently been in development since 2018, and was a third-person shooter with looting elements and a heavy emphasis on vertical movement - grapples, double-jumps, aerial dashes, and wall-climbing. According to Bloomberg, ZeniMax Online Studios envisaged the game as the beginning of a "new franchise", running alongside Elder Scrolls Online, which has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-f2p">a wobbly endeavour at times</a> but is currently quite the success story, earning a reported $2 billion in total revenue by 2024.</p>
<p>By March this year, the development team had reportedly expanded to 300 people, and Xbox executives Phil Spencer and Matt Booty are said to have been impressed by a demo they sampled in March 2025. But the positivity was not to last. According to Bloomberg's sources, staff were shocked to learn this week that ZeniMax Online Studios head Matt Firor had left the company, and that project Blackbird had been "indefinitely shelved".</p>
<p>Many of those employees now face redundancy, pending the outcome of a haggle over things like severance packages between Microsoft and their union. A Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed this much to Bloomberg, commenting "represented employees are awaiting information regarding these proposed impacts and next steps, which are subject to negotiations with the union".</p>
<p>The scale of Microsoft's recent earnings make this week's layoffs feel like an enormous practical joke. Still, I can guess at elements of the executive reasoning here. Live service games are both costly and increasingly risky, because there is so much competition. Schreier also claims that ZeniMax Online Studios were developing the game's engine technology alongside the game itself, which in my experience covering such things is a hard act to pull off.</p>
<p>Still, assuming Bloomberg's reporting is legit, the fact remains that the C-suits liked it and Microsoft seem to have doubloons to spare right now. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Campaign to stop online games becoming unplayable still wants more eligible signatures</p>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's petition to the European Commission has hit a major milestone, surpassing a million signatures. However, the YouTuber behind this effort to stop companies from rendering games unplayable by shutting down their servers is still asking for more folks to get their pens out and sign, due to concerns about fakery.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ross Scott originally launched <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">back in 2024</a>, after Ubisoft pulled racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline. Cue a lot of debates about terms of service which tell folks that when you buy a game, you're not buying permanent access to it, but rather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">a license to play it</a> for as long as it exists.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">European Citizens' Initiative</a> has crossed 1 million signatures. Except it hasn't," Scott announced in a video update uploaded to his channel Accursed Farms yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody's mistakes."</p>
<p>"That could be a lot," he continued, "I've heard 10% minimum, 20% is better, 40% should be really safe." The second issue is that Scott says he's "received several reports of people claiming to [have spoofed] signatures on the initiative site."</p>

<p>"First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition. This is a government process," Scott continues. "Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this."</p>
<p>It's unclear at this point whether any folks spoofing signatures on the EU petition might end up being prosecuted for doing so, but it won't invalidate the campaign as a whole. However, the fact Scott's even heard talk of such a thing has left him unsure of exactly how many real signatures he's got. He reckons there are "at least 600â€“700k" at current.</p>
<p>Hence him <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">asking for EU citizens</a> to keep on signing legitimately. As of writing, the EU petition is at 1,091,165 signatures, with a million having been the goal that would lead the European Commission to at least look into the issue.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games also has a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/">UK petition</a>, which currently has just over 150k signatures, and looks set to receive a date when it'll be debated in parliament soon. That said, the UK Government have already issued a response to that petition back in February, which reads: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games. Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue."</p>
<p>"I would bet money on the EU initiative delivering something good if it passes, but the UK has been more about exhausting all options," Scott says in the video. He adds regarding that previous response from UK politicians: "A member of Parliament could sneeze on the petition, and that would not be a worse answer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake]]></content:encoded>
