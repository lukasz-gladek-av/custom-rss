<p>I adore the premise of DoubleWe: you’re given a randomised appearance, dumped in a cramped sci-fi shithole full of dodgy-looking NPCs, and forced to find kill your identical clone before he can emerge from the crowd and shank you first. There’s a demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>, and it’s provoked in me some of the most pulse-quickening paranoia since the days of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>ID’ing the clone is, despite the ruffian density, usually the easy part. You have a mirror on you at all times, and the Evil You typically prefers to bide their time and blend in instead of rushing straight for the kill, so you have a few moments to memorise your doppelganger. Still, that window is better spent scrounging up a flimsy knife or one-shot pistol from weapon stashes. Rather than wrapping you in a comfort blanket of justifiable self-defence violence, however, arming yourself only serves to up the tension further.</p>
<p>Opening the stashes is agonisingly slow – my very first death came when the clone took advantage of my apparent difficulties with operating a briefcase – and the weapons themselves force you into close-range, all-or-nothing confrontations with an opponent who’s far less likely to miss their swing. Add in the general unease of how readily the clustered NPCs will stop to stare at you, plus the knowledge that DoubleWe’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> structure means failure will send you back to the start of a chapter, and each round becomes a deliciously mistrustful slice of shortform suspense. Even taking the time to stalk your own stalker at the beginning doesn’t help much, as stopping to grab a weapon is more than enough time for them to melt back into the throng, or to lurk behind the corners of a chokepoint. I ain’t walking though that doorway, man. The other me might be in there.</p>

<p>That’s just the earliest encounters, too. After a few successful slayings, any hopes of settling down into more relaxed clone deathmatches are dashed by devious raisings of the stakes. First, officers are introduced to baton you senseless if they see you gearing up an attack, forcing you to either strike more swiftly or coax your pursuer into a quieter corner. Then, an anonymous assassin is dispatched to actively hunt you from the start, laying on even more pressure (and, if you decide to fight back, depleting your weapon uses) while forcing you to scan every single one of these blockheaded creeps for a telltale blade. I remain both intrigued and perturbed by the more overtly horror-flavoured antagonist variants that the final game will feature, including clones that explode into raging, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4</a>-style meat yuccas, though such monstrosities would be in keeping with DoubleWe’s taste for escalating threats.</p>
<p>I only rarely enjoy being scared in games, but I do crave a more sustained, eerie flavour of tension – it’s what made creeping through Chernogorsk, praying its snipers were watching elsewhere, such an electric thrill. DoubleWe manages to recreate and intensify that feeling in compact, minute-and-a-half bursts, and I’d dearly like to string myself out on more of them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/">The demo</a> for Kaizen's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> throws a lot of ideas you, but at its heart, it's just a game about being a good boss.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stripped back, it's part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> driving game, part business management. You pull up in the cursed town of Kaso-Machi, a broke yakuza with a sentient severed digit hanging out in the back of your grimy pickup truck.</p>
<p>You're here to make scratch helping the locals, so you'll need to recruit mascot creatures to hire out for jobs. They're a hopeless bunch, possessing all the neurotic animism you'd expect from distinctly 21st century yōkai. You're soon negotiating salaries and benefits with a giant block of perpetually weeping tofu. Then, enlisting the help of a traffic safety superhero to help out when jobs go south.</p>
<p>The tofu gets stuck in a door on their first job. To help out on the next, I pack them a lunch comprising a wilted hamburger from a vending machine. The tutorial missions dry up, so I open the map. It takes a moment to realise what I'm looking at. Or, rather, what I'm not.</p>

<p>Not a nagging map marker in sight, despite a menu telling me there are several tasks available. Promise Mascot Agency will only mark the activities available on your map if you explicity tell it to. You ask Pinky for hint, and choose the type of activity you fancy, whether that's recruiting new mascots, finding new jobs, or hiring more heroes. Once you ask - and only then - the game adds a pin showing where to find that type of task.</p>
<p>This is - if I'm using my academic ludology terms correctly - the good shit. An adrenaline shot for decision paralysis. A Marie Kondolance for our era's inescapable hellscape of cluttered landscapes. I have stared deep into the skittish eyes of the chattering mind monkey and sealed his lips together with Gorilla Glue, but not before <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/1dlwkv3/til_heightmogging/">heightmogging</a> him with the gorilla on the label. Thank you, Promise Mascot Agency.</p>
<p>There's plenty more to love here. The town is run down and dusky, but the landscape flows in such a way that you can see the streetlights shoal together from a distance. Driving in from the outskirts feels like it does when you catch a taxi in from an airport; the rising swell of life and lights and noise despite a ghostly ambience. Dreamy, dark pop slows to a warped cassette crawl when you pause. I collect floating coins that each tell tiny stories with their confirmation pop ups. A wallet containing a shopping list with nothing crossed off. A thousand yen note used a bookmark. When I crash the car my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-use-a-ps5-dualsense-controller-on-pc">DualSense</a> speaker starts yelling a cartoonish, clattering racket at me.</p>

<p>A pack of ghostly foxes escape from a mechanic's garage while I'm chatting to him. I chase them for truck upgrades. The first gives me a cannon that lets me shoot Pinky at the remaining foxes. You can't leave your truck, which is tiny bit awkward in certain spots, but you can bunny hop and boost over difficult terrain. Your truck is invulnerable and I wholly believe the game wants you to drive like an idiot.</p>
<p>I think the tofu crying all the time is a reference to how irritating it is to drain tofu so you can grill it properly, although its mainly used here to humiliate the poor creature. Alongside the exploration, social, and management aspects, the other part of Promise Mascot Agency is card battles that take place when your mascots run into trouble on their jobs. They look like this:</p>

<p>The demo is unfortunately timed, and I didn't get much of a chance to see how much depth the card game has, but the basic idea is that you use the cards of the heroes you've recruited to damage whatever obstacle you're up against like a boss battle. Run out of actions before you win, and you lose. It's perhaps the game's weakest aspect but again, I barely scratched the surface. Still, what's here is just as beautifully odd and oddly beautiful as you'd expect from Kaizen. It's due out this year, and I will make that tofu smile if it kills me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
