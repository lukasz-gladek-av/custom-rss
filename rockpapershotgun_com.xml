            <p>As Graham pointed out earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-difficult-game-about-climbing">A Difficult Game About Climbing</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-difficult-game-about-climbing-is-a-difficult-game-about-climbing">difficult game about climbing</a>. A Bennett Foddy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>-inspired limb-flailer, where hoisting yourself up a mountain as a bald man is painfully moreish. Well, let me introduce you to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-difficult-game-about-driving">A Difficult Game About Driving</a>, a difficult game about driving. Again, you play as a bald man (called Jeff) who sits in a 4x4 bathtub and must ascend a series of difficult roads. There's a demo out now and let me tell you, it's awfully good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jeff's Bathtub Defender reminds me a bit of the vehicles from the PlayStation 1 game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPjXU2uxQo4">Speed Freeks</a>, where the wheels were like, way bigger than the main chassis. <em>Anyway</em>, you're to drive upwards. You tickle the throttle, feather the break, press space to jump, and frantically tap WASD to avoid tumbling off gigantic gnarled tree branches and floating rocks. If you do? A parachute will engage, but the likelihood is you'll float right back to where you started.</p>

<p>Early on at least, it doesn't strike me as always twisty and turny for the sake of it. The game understands that in order to mess with drivers, it must tap into everyone's desire to go fast.</p>
<p>Occasionally it offers you a ramp with an enticing hole to launch yourself into, which in any other game might be the way forwards. Or you might transition from tree branches to a race track, with the game suddenly timing your effort. Take the bait and forget the premise of the game momentarily, and that's Jeff sailing back to the bottom. The game is dastardly, I have to give it that.</p><p>Another thing I like: it's fairly easy to control. Although overly heavy keyboard inputs can spell disaster, you're not forever wrestling with limbs and trajectories in your head. The straightforward movement gives things a nice flow while also providing a steady trickle of anxiety.</p>
<p>A Difficult Game About Driving is due out sometime in early 2025 and you can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3175860/A_Difficult_Game_About_Driving/">Steam demo here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youve-got-ten-days-to-pick-up-the-original-warcraft-i-ii-from-gog-before-blizzard-pull-them-but-gog-will-support-their-preservation-forever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In response to a decision from Blizzard to pull the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-2-tides-darkness">Warcraft I &amp; II</a> from GOG later this month, following the release of the remastered versions, GOG have updated their preservation policy. The real time<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc"> strategy</a> games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1863583943229833251">released a statement</a> committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle">currently on discount</a> as a bundle.</p>
<p>"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. "Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important. With that in mind, we’ve decided to update one aspect of the GOG Preservation Program’s policy." Here's the critical line in ceremonial blockquote attire:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Going forward, even if a game is no longer available for sale on GOG, as part of the GOG Preservation Program, it will continue to be maintained and updated by us, ensuring it remains compatible with modern and future systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>They go on to say that they’re incredibly proud of the work they’ve done on both games, and that anyone who’s purchased them before their removal will "still enjoy the most compatible, high-quality versions," including offline installers. They then go on to say the word ‘gamers’ a few more times, presumably pausing while they type to imagine rapturous applause. It’s a great initiative, GOG, but I’ve seen dairy farmers milk it less. Love you though!</p><p>GOG recently relaunched 100 games newly minted with the "Good Old Game status", which means they’ll be kept updated, preserved, and playable in perpetuity. As James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">deftly pointed out in his coverage</a>, "GOG ultimately exist to sell games, not immortalise them in museums, nor hand them out to people who owned an original CD-ROM copy back in yesteryear," though it’s "better that someone profits off a healthy game preservation pipeline than to not have one at all."</p>
<p>And that’s about where I land too: without some sort of profit incentive, this stuff just isn’t going to happen without a serious fight. "I don’t believe that we’ve found a commercial solution for your video game staying alive forever. No one is against the idea of video game preservation, but companies and their shareholders are against the idea of not making a profit," Frank Cifaldi of the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a> told me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">earlier this year</a> . "It's a technical black hole; It costs a lot of money to port a video game, and if the margins are just not there, then there's not a business rationale to keep things alive."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
