How do teens in IT classes waste their time these days? When I was a young whippersnapper, when my teacher wasn't looking I'd head to sites like Miniclip, Nitrome, wherever I could get my hands on some Flash games, to play all sorts of little oddities, particularly system heavy ones that were fun to mess around with for 10 minutes once in a while. Games like that feel rare now with the death of Flash, but I think Tower Lab, a physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> tower defence deckbuilder where you attempt to blast enemies off a ledge into an infinite void to their demise, feels pretty close.
</p>
<p>
Tower Lab works thusly: there are two portals, one where variously coloured upright beans are emitted, another where they enter. You are presented with a selection of cards, all of which cost a certain amount of points, points which you are in limited supply of, that allow you to plant different bits of machinery to try and shove these enemy beans off a ledge.

These machines come in a range of flavours. For example, one is quite simply a fan, turning on every so often to attempt to push the beans off. Some beans are too heavy, however, so you might place a shrink ray earlier along the tower so that they're easier to blow off. A gif on the game's Steam page shows how you can take this even further by shrinking them down, making them weightless, blowing them away, before making them even larger than before so that they fall to their deaths. Systems! They're quite neat, and from what I can tell your technical know-how will be put to the test more and more over the course of the game's various levels.
</p><p>
This is exactly the kind of game I would have loved messing about with as a distracted teen. IT class is a waste of time! But a game like Tower Lab isn't. It's quite satisfying in small doses, and levels don't waste your time either. I quite like the foundations that have been laid here, and look forward to recreating scenes from my youth when it launches later this year. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3084810/Tower_Lab/">here</a>.

            <p>
Sometimes, the world you live in sucks. It is a place filled with despair, and misery, and blood, guts, and death. This is much the case with the world of Mörk Borg, an apocalyptic fantasy TTRPG where you have no sense of hope, only dread, that is now also a video game. This video game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mork-borg-heresy-supreme">Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme</a>, is more of an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, though its tabletop routes are still to be found, and it is as mean as it is darkly enchanting.
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it very much takes after its original book form, using only black, white, yellow and red for its colour scheme (you can guess what the red is used for). In the demo version of the game there is only one class to choose from, whose stats and starting weapon are randomly generated. Though, you can just re-roll infinitely until you get something you've happy with, an ability I hope is limited in the full release.

<p>
To start, you are tasked with finding a troll finger. You set out into the world, this miserable little world, on a 2D plane, your only directional options being left or right. When you finally meet enemies, you can slash at them with your weapon, be it a femur, a knife, or a scimitar you pick up after slicing a skeleton in half. There's a dodging mechanic, you both consume items for health or lob them at your opponents for damage, this starting class can also kick or block with a shield. It is laborious in a way that teeters on the edge of being insufferable, though I expect it'll fall right off for some.
</p><p>
Everything is slow, some of it perhaps a bit too much so, yet there's a method to the madness. You don't have much health, so timing a block or a dodge and a slash at just the right time is important. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> comparisons are all but guaranteed to be made in future reviews. I died quite quickly, of course, this game is tough and cares not for your happiness. Dying almost seems like it's the point, especially with its lightly procedurally generated world.
</p>
<p>
The RPGness of it all comes in the occasional dice roll, a digital D20 randomly deciding your fate, your character's attributes assisting or impeding said rolls. Levelling up comes at set points apparently, with some skills improving, others worsening. It is a player hostile game, one that begs for you to challenge it, and that'll be a boon for many, and a curse for many more.
</p>
<p>
It's too early for me to say whether I like the thing or not, but I can say I'll be curious to give it another look whenever it does come out. In the meantime, you can check out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216800/MRK_BORG_Heresy_Supreme/">here</a>.
