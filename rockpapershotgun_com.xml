            <p>
There just doesn't seem to be a good time to release a game right now, does there? We all saw the way that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> scared away plenty of games, even games with completely different genres. And sometimes it's just a case of a particular month being stacked - just this month alone there's Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6, Pokemon Legends Z-A, Ninja Gaiden 4, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, Dispatch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the list truly goes on. So, I really can't blame developer Digital Sun, who've announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a> has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
The developer shared word of said delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/525355229451912554?l=english">Steam news post</a> earlier today, as the game was originally slated for release October 23rd, later this month. But, as they note, "the month has filled up with so many other great releases that we feel it has become too crowded for us. And as every wise shopkeeper knows, even the most precious gem can be overlooked in an overstuffed showcase." So now, you can expect the game to launch on November 19th, a little more than a month later.
</p>
<p>
As a little bonus to make up for the delay, Digital Sun will also be running some closed playtests to let you try the game out, in particular to get a feel for some of the changes made based on community feedback. More details on that are coming soon, apparently.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2 looks like it's picking up where the original game left things off, gameplay wise at least, having now been transported to the realm of 3D. Based on an interview between the devs and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-preview-inteview-hades-inspired/">TheGamer</a> earlier this year, you can also expect it to fully lean into being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, which admittedly is a bit of an oversaturated genre right now. Fingers crossed the still fun concept of having to plunge into dungeons to stock your own shop is strong enough to find success this time around too!

            <p>
When you review a game, if you don't know anyone else that's also reviewing it, it can be a bit difficult to guess how it might be received overall. There's normally some assumptions you can make, but with a series like Silent Hill, a series where the general consensus is all over the place from game to game, it's certainly not easy to predict. I myself ended up being quite fascinated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">review of it</a>, but in a recent interview series producer Motoi Okamoto said that despite an overall positive reception, you shouldn't expect every consequent game to be just like it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g">IGN Japan</a> at TGS last month (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/future-silent-hill-games-wont-necessarily-follow-silent-hill-f-formula-producer-says-we-want-to-keep-experimenting-with-each-new-title/">Automaton</a>), Okamoto said how he expected responses to the game much more divided than they ended up being due to its "challenging" elements. This is where the but comes in. But! As he notes, "that doesn’t mean every future Silent Hill will be like Silent Hill f. Each one will have its own distinct flavor. We want to keep experimenting and be ambitious, both in terms of gameplay design and storytelling, so please look forward to the next Silent Hill as well."
</p>
<p>
The producer doubled down on this sentiment on <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537">Bitter</a>, the nothing app, saying he wants to be bold with the series and make it so that each subsequent game offers fresh gameplay. Though he doesn't want to abandon a key point about the series either - "I believe psychological stories are essential to what makes Silent Hill feel like ‘Silent Hill,’ and we’ll continue to place great importance on that in future works as well."
</p>
<p>
Part of the process I took with reviewing Silent Hill f was working out my own feelings on how necessary the series is now, and if there's anything it can offer any more. The answer, as it turns out, was yes, actually, so despite my curmudgeonly attitude towards it, I am curious to see where it goes next.
