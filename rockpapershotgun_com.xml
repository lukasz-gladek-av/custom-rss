            <p>The lead designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> has announced that he's making something like Left 4 Dead again - a four-player co-op shooter that "expands on the co-op-formula in ways I've wanted to explore for a long time".
</p>
<p>Whatever they end up calling it, the game is in development at Bad Robot Games, a studio founded by the film and TV outfit behind Lost, Cloverfield and Westworld. So the project has both expertise and funding to spare, in theory. There is little else to tell, right now, but you can sign up for a playtest if all this has you combing the rooftops for Smokers and scrabbling around for your shotgun.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Former Turtle Rock creative director Mike Booth announced the project in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/">a Reddit post this week</a>. "If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead aside, Booth has credits on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-condition-zero">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>. He worked for Valve after they acquired Turtle Rock in 2008, then left in 2012 to join Blizzard and work on something unannounced. Then he went to Facebook to work on multiplayer virtual reality mcGuffins for the Oculus Rift. Most recently, he joined the board of directors for Resolution, creators of tabletop RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>. Here's hoping the new Left 4 Deadlike isn't some kind of VR exclusive, or otherwise tainted by exposure to Mark Zuckerberg's skullfucking metaverse meanderings.
</p><p>"We're still in the early stages of development, but we're opening up playtests to a limited number of players," Booth added in the Reddit post. "If you're interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we'd love to have you involved." You can sign up for a playtest <a href="https://www.badrobotgames.com/invite">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm always keen to play anything Left 4 Deadlike, but I have been burned before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> was not the unofficial Left 4 Dead 3 its title format implied, partly because it tried to make Left 4 Dead's spontaneously 'AI-directed', playable B-movie gambit work within a clunky latter-day progression system.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">had fun with Back 4 Blood</a>, admittedly, calling it "peak early-00s cheese". And there have been other, recent quatrofoil co-operational bangalongs that pull off something like the old L4D vibe, such as Fatshark's various first-person Warhammer games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a> from 10 Chambers, and dwarven asteroid miner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.
</p>
<p>(Side note to Rock Paper Shotgun's automatic keyword linking system: why do you link some game titles, and not others? Why do you vex and torment me so? I will never unravel your heathen wiles and mocking parlor tricks.)</p>
<p>As for the possibility of an actual Left 4 Dead 3 - those magic words <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files">appear in relatively recent Valve documentation</a>, but I've seen little evidence that such a project is in active development. Right now, the Steam company appear focussed on perennial chart topper Counter-Strike 2 and the upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock. As for Booth's old joint Turtle Rock, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-2-appears-to-be-a-thing-which-is-a-shame-because-id-rather-play-a-new-evolve">appear to be making Back 4 Blood 2</a>, which displeases me inasmuch as I'd rather they make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been a little while since we got another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> tease that makes folks wonder whether CD Projekt are about to u-turn on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">adding more stuff to it</a> yet again. Here one is, though, and it invites us 2025 dwellers to help out a president who isn't elected in-universe until 2065.</p>
<p>Is it evidence that the NUSA have invented time travel tech that also allows Cyberpunk characters to migrate into our own reality? Is it just a way to spice up some promo for something like a livestream or minor reveal? I mean, almost definitely the latter, but the former's a lot more fun to consider.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, the tease. NUSA president Rosalind Myers, the one from Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty expansion, needs "brave netrunners" to help her nation overcome a "mounting cybersecurity threat". The plea's dated September 4th, 2025, which is in the future, but not quite far enough into the future to match up with Myers' in-game presidential term. That kicks off in 2065, which is why she's still in power by the time V meets her in 2077.</p>
<p>What's president Roz doing teasing things dated about 40 years before she takes office, that're also happening in a different universe? Are Arasaka about to take over the official Witcher socials to post their own messages to us, inciting a seven hundredth corporate Twitter war? Are Kang Tao about to reveal they're behind the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">mysterious Project Hadar</a>? As I say, probably not. If this is anything, the netrunner "recruitment test" aspect seems to hint at an ARG of some sort being in the offing.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Naturally, some fans have immediately gone off the deep end with extra expansion theories. If that's you, it's maybe worth bearing in mind that CD Projekt senior community manager Amelia Korzycka has responded to one user on the tweeter asking what the tease is with <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965">the following message</a>: "All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch."
 </p>
<p>"'The' DLC? Instead of 'a' DLC?Y ou're gonna dive people crazy, you know that right? Me included," another user replied to Korzycka. "Is there an expansion DLC in the works?" The community manager, I assume after a deep sigh, has simply <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962759935608938808">responded to this query</a> with a "No."</p>
<p>Given that, I'd very much temper your expectations. It'd be foolish to totally rule out CD Projekt adding yet more stuff to Cyberpunk given the past few years, though. Here's hoping they at least explain Myers' ability to move through time and space.</p>
<p>Has it required her to fork over a bit of her brain space to Neo from The Matrix doing his best dickhead rock singer impression? Will Cyberpunk 2 be about stopping Roz and/or Idris Elba's Solomon Reed from going back in time to kill one of V's ancestors while dressed in leather and speaking like the most Austrian cyborg you've ever met? We need answers.</p>
