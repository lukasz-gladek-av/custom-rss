            <p>Well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> developers Blizzard have decided to have a bit of extra fun with all the junk that'll fill up the new player houses rolling out in full with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-releases-in-march-bringing-voidstorm-plague-on-all-the-new-houses">March's Midnight expansion</a>. The MMO's getting a prop hunt mode dubbed Decor Duel, designed to act as a "small diversion" from the whole Xal’atath-led void invasion business.</p>

<p>Decor Duel was one of the many incoming WOW things outlined during yesterday's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250385/catch-up-on-the-state-of-azeroth-in-our-recap">State of Azeroth showcase</a>, which saw Blizzard detail all of their 2026 plans beyond the launch of Midnight. It's prop hunt as you'd likely expect prop hunt if you're a veteran of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> or more recently the likes of Call of Duty. Two teams of five on a map in a city or neighbourhood, one with the ability to turn into random items via illusion magic, and the other tasked with hunting down their hiding spots amid the area's regular fixtures.</p>
<p>"You might not defeat the Void and save Azeroth by taking part in this event, but it’s a great way to find a bit of fun in the face of the ever present and growing threat the Void presents," Blizzard admit. Prop hunt will be coming with patch 12.0.5, which is set to arrive not long after Midnight's launch on March 2nd. That same patch will also bring void assaults, which are a chance to fight back against the whole Xal’atath thing by slapping up some enemies invading random spots throughout the world.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first major update arriving after Midnight will be 12.1 in the summer, which Blizzard wouldn't get into specifics on in terms of name or setting, but they did reveal that it'll come with "a new zone with maximum level content, new raid, and a new season with an updated Mythic+ dungeon Pool, new PvP and Delves rewards", plus an overhaul of the Friends system. After Blizzcon in September, another update called 12.1.5 will be bringing "Labyrinths" to the MMO, these being new mega-dungeon-esque adventures designed to play like the shorter Delves added as part of The War Within. Blizzard describe them as follows: "large sprawling experiences you can tackle all at once or a bit at a time depending on your own schedule. They will have a different form and reward structure than are currently available in Delves but retain the core elements of exploring and besting foes alongside your Delve companion."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the publisher's 2026 plans also include a mysterious new mode from the team who've previously created pirate-themed battle royale mode Plunderstorm and Remix.</p>
<p>So, there are the things. If you've not kept abreast of all the hulabaloo that's been going on ahead of Midnight around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-devs-blizzard-will-offer-folks-a-free-wardrobe-change-just-before-midnight-following-fashion-fee-furore">WOW's transition between two types of gear transmog system</a>, you'll be glad to learn Blizzard have stepped to try and limit the gold costs involved in existing players making the switch.</p>

            <p>
If you’ve ever intrepidly looked up a Paradox game, seen a million DLC expansions on the Steam page, and fled screaming into the woods, rest assured that Paradox have you in their eye. It’s doubtful they’re going to change anything about their broad DLC strategy, mind, but they’re aware that some players may feel reluctant to purchase older Paradox games that have dozens of add-ons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
“We're well aware that if you go in and see a barrage of DLCs, it might be a bit off-putting to buy the game directly if you're a new gamer, but [like we] mentioned we do bundling to get different types of starter packs, to make it easier to get on board,” commented CEO Fred Wester in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHWAVZVRxW">the company’s latest financial earnings call</a> with investors. “We also work with pricing in different territories, but also deep discounting and publisher weekends and whatnot. We also have DLC subscriptions on – is it a majority of our games, or at least maybe half of our games? 
</p>
<p>
“So that's an option as well. You pay a smaller sum to try everything out, and you can do it on a monthly basis. So those are the strategies we've tried so far, and they're working really well. But we continue to to try to make our offerings more appealing to more gamers.”
</p>
<p>
Why exactly are people put off by DLC barrages? Wester doesn’t spell it out, but for me, the agonising introspective journey goes like this: I do not want to spend all that extra money, but I’m also worried that I’m missing out on something crucial if I stick with the base game – yes, even though Paradox are in the habit of chunky free updates. For all I know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron">Hearts of Iron</a> 4’s La Résistance expansion is the difference between Pétainist ignominie and Charles-de-Gaullic triomphe.</p><p>I could go read some reviews of La Résistance or one of the game’s 25 other add-ons, but that would take several extra minutes of research and this was supposed to be an impulse purchase. ARGH! I’m going to buy a Creative Assembly game instead. 
</p>
<p>
*opens <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 Steam page* 
</p>
<p>*soul is ejected from body*
</p>
<p>
I don’t think there’s a way out of this predicament, while Paradox are in the business of making fat stacks over several years by way of paid expansions alongside free updates and re-promotion. Part of it is that Paradox are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">renowned for ‘long tail’ post-release development</a>, so even a brand new Paradox grand strategy game with a modest handful of preorder cosmetics looks suspect - a submerged Great White waiting to explode from the waves and guzzle you down like some loathsome, cash-strapped, time-poor penguin. Swim penguin, swim! Lest you too accidentally take out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> subscription.

            <p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>' release on February 11th, devs RGG Studio have announced plans to put out a day one patch to fix visual issues spotted the remade beat-em-up's demo. Specifically, there's a section of the game's version of downtown Okinawa by a river which players have pointed out to be garishly oversaturated compared to the original Yakuza 3 and its previous remaster.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can certainly see it in posts folks have compiled which put the two games' riverside vistas alongside each other. I didn't find it too off-putting when playing through the demo myself, though I had opted to tone the brightness down to compensate, which made a couple of night scenes a bit harder to make out. So, it's good news RGG are planning to sort it out.</p>
<p>"Rest assured the graphical quality of the demo does not represent the final experience," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/RGGStudio/status/2017040175180796074">Tweeter post</a>. "We plan to have a v1.11 patch available at launch which will address the lighting issue and other quality concerns in the full game. One specific example is the visual and lighting issues around the Kubochi River area in the Downtown Ryukyu area, which many of you have already pointed out."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>RGG added that the patch will "include not just fixes for the issues identified above, but many other improvements" and that the timing of its release might vary by platform. Here's hoping its PC arrival isn't left until last.</p>
<p>While they have now publicly acknowledged these lighting issues, RGG Studio have so far opted not to issue a response to a Yakuza fan petition calling on them to re-cast one of the game's actor's, Teriyuki Kagawa. The backlash against Kagawa's casting stems from a 2022 report by Japanese magazine Shukan Shincho that the actor sexually harassed a female employee at a club in Tokyo’s Ginza district in 2019.
