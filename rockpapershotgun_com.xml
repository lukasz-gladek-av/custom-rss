While there is a notable enough sentiment that old games are worse because they are old, so should therefore be either let to rot or to be remade so that they are "better," I think this argument goes out the window when you look at something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xi">Final Fantasy 11</a>. That thing came out in 2022! And it launched on PS2 first! Yet here it is more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-23-years-on-final-fantasy-11-is-still-getting-updates-with-one-coming-thatll-let-you-change-how-your-character-looks">still getting updates</a>, and now, potentially, an entire new zone.
</p>
<p>
This week saw a new Freshly Picked Vana'diel, a semi-regularly held livestream from the Final Fantasy 11 team similar in nature to Final Fantasy 14's Letter from the Producer streams that details upcoming additions or changes, that sort of thing. It was held in Japanese, which I don't speak, but luckily some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/1oqvpee/freshly_picked_future_plans/">Redditors</a> who do explained that the team is seemingly preparing for the ability to make new areas.

As mentioned, this was originally a PS2 game, the PC release came a short while after, and that fact also appears to be a problem for the FF11 team. Everything is still made using the original PS2 dev kits, which obviously will be massively outdated by this point. Judging from some of the comments, on-stream the team discussed that they're working on plans in the event that these dev kits don't work anymore so that they can make new equipment still, and in particular start making new areas again.
</p><p>
I may not have spent any time with Final Fantasy 11 myself, but it really can't be understated how valuable it is that this 23 year old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is still going, let alone the fact it's still getting new content. These spaces become second homes (or even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/second-life">Second Life</a>) for some people, and sure, we should strive to not be too beholden to our computers, but they are still realms of virtual existence that deserve to be maintained. A new area would be pretty significant as there hasn't been a big new one since its 2015 expansion Seekers of Adoulin. Fingers crossed for those of you still playing!

I know, I know, change is difficult isn't it? It upset me just the other day that YouTube has changed videos so that they have rounded corners instead of being perfectly rectangular. It's sacrilegious! A feeling I will continue to have until I ultimately forget about it because life moves on to the next grievance. Still, subtle changes like that can often set some kind of internal alarm bells off, something you might have been experiencing with store pages on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> looking a bit… wider.
</p>
<p>
That is because they are, in fact, wider! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> have said as such somewhere along the line, and the update arrived in the digital storefront yesterday, with a nifty little <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/506217467911081528">blog post</a> explaining and showing what the changes actually are. Essentially, store pages for games and the few bits that aren't games have been widened from 940 pixels to 1200 pixels. Doesn't sound like much, but seeing it side by side, there's a surprising amount of space that's been added.
</p>
<p>
That's not the only difference, though. Images that show up in the carousel now have a higher resolution, and there's a couple new viewing modes to go along with that too; theater mode plasters images and videos across most of the screen, and full-screen mode is exactly what it sounds like. Devs will also have more control over the about sections of their games, again with bigger and higher-quality images, and more flexible formatting. You might also notice that store pages' background images pop a bit more too, as more colour and texture will come through.
</p>
<p>
This widening of Steam applies to other aspects of the store too, like search results and recommendation pages, with some general size adjustments for individual tags, charts, and the news hub. Apparently the homepage will be subject to a widening in the "near future too." Also, you shouldn't need to worry about pages being too wide if you're using a narrow browser or client, because Valve even tested it on some old iPod a team member "had laying around." Classic Valve.
