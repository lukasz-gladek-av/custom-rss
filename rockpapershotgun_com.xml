The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> series will live on, but Elden Ring 2? That's slightly more in doubt. So says Hidetaka Miyazaki, the original Elden Lord, in a new interview about From Software's current projects, which apparently span a variety of genres.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The interview in question is a roundtable chat from this month's PS Awards, as passed on by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html">Game Watch</a>. It's also in Japanese. Not being much of a Japanese reader, I'm wary of quoting from it directly, but Miyazaki does say that right now, Elden Ring 2 is not in development, though From naturally has plans for Elden Ring in general. Miyazaki has previously suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">From Software's future game projects might be smaller in terms of development resources than Elden Ring</a>, commenting in the wake of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC that he'd have serious "concerns" about going bigger.
</p>
<p>
Chalk the hesitancy about Elden Ring 2 up as a minor tactical victory for everybody's favourite high school club, the Elden Ring Isn't That Amazing Brigade, current president: me. I have wittered on here before about my apathy for From's first "proper" open world game, so I won't bend your ear about the superiority of branching world design again. But I will say that I'd much rather play, for example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">a Bloodborne PC port</a> or a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a>, From's magnificently mouldy reprise of Tenchu.
</p>
<p>
In the interview above, Miyazaki also says that From Software have a variety of projects on the go, spanning a range of genres - this in response to a question about whether their next game will be science-fiction or fantasy. Miyazaki himself appears to be game director for at least one of these projects.</p><p>This isn't exactly mind-blowing news - From Software have been working on parallel projects that straddle the realms of fantasy and SF for years. But I'm happy to think aloud about what kind of fiction the next From Software project might inhabit, assuming it isn't a sequel.
</p>
<p>
In particular, I was talking to Brendy the other day about the possibility of a From Software Soulslike that isn't broadly the tale of an outcast chosen one overthrowing a corrupted divine ruler. While the details vary, that particular thematic arc is arguably the heart of every Souls game. Given the extent to which the politics and metaphysics of From's worlds inform the detail of character progression and combat, I'm not sure it's even possible to make a Soulslike that isn't about a cosmic cycle of usurpation. I guess the obvious source of inspiration would be the Armored Core series, which tell a different kind of story. Then again, I've never found Armored Core plots very exciting.
</p>
<p>
I might end up writing a fusty longread on the subject. As and when I ever get to interview Miyazaki, I'll ask him about it too. Although in the shorter term, I would probably ask him whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-is-in-talks-to-buy-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-parent-company-kadokawa">Sony are really going to buy From Software's parent company Kadokawa</a>, and if so, how that might impact his job.

            <p>We don't know yet if the AI revolution of our reality will go full Skynet or simply end with the robots unceremoniously dumping us like a sad Joaquin Phoenix. But at least video games can help us speculate. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heart-of-the-machine">Heart Of The Machine</a> is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a "turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG", which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo. </p>

<p>It's due out January 31st, say the devs, and will be an early access release. The game takes place in a grim future civilisation where "despite its technological advances and dreams of a bright future, centuries of rot have taken hold". Sounds familiar. From the video, it does look very 4X-ish, with a lot of detailed menus and building sidebars. The city will feature "genetics labs, factories, nuclear silos, military complexes, and much more", we're told. You can build robot manufacturing plants to make android fighters, and tap into the city's electricity grid to power your processor-heavy scheming. Although it all depends what sort of AI big boss you want to be, say the creators.</p>
<p>"Raise an army of robots to rule by force, become a benevolent machine overlord, or explore a constellation of alternative paths as you strive to find your place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving (from itself)."</p>
<p>To that end, it looks like there'll be some classic moralistic decision-making. One prompt in the above trailer shows a robot meeting a bunch of slum cats. You get the choice to befriend the cats (correct choice) or liquidate them for "samples" (evil, bad, unforgivable choice - do not pick, do not harm the cats, I am warning you). There will also be different factions who can serve as allies or rivals, like the "corrupt corporate executives that run the city" who you might tap for cash or vow to destroy. </p><p>There are military options to achieve your goals too, including "a varied array of combat androids for when things get violent". You can catch a quick glimpse of the phrase "slurry spiders" in the trailer, for example (as someone who grew up near a farm with a slurry pit, this is a truly terrifying concept). But there'll also be more hacky and manipulative ways to go about getting what you want, say the devs. </p>
<p>But why am I even repeating all this stuff? You can just go play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/">the demo on Steam</a> if you're interested. It has been playable since an earlier Steam Next Fest. But it's now been updated to include a rewritten prologue, rejigged combat, and some new quests and events, including one in which you can "adopt a pet". Please do not liquidate it for samples.</p>
<p>Also, don't confuse this game with the other robo-led urban sprawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-a-blissful-art-deco-sci-fi-city-as-an-ai-mayor-in-technotopia-out-this-october">Technotopia</a>, a city-building card game in which you also play as the AI "mayor" of a big art deco futuropolis. They are different robots. Please don't upset the machines.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
