There are two shooters that I imagine will never die, because they just seem to hang on despite being incredibly old and plenty of other games coming out in the mean-time: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> (both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> games, funnily enough - they've clearly got the Source (sorry)). <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which came out back in 2023, is the most played shooter of all time on Steam in fact, but even now the original game is still pretty popular. There's literally more than 16,000 people playing it right now. And though it might not be official, a group of modders have come together to remake the 1.6 version of the game.
</p>

<p>
Titled CS: Legacy, the team behind it want you to know that this isn't just a fancy mod of the classic shooter, but a "from the ground up" remaking made with completely custom code and original assets. It should still have that same Valve feel to it, though, as the entire thing is being made in the developer's official 2013 Source Engine SDK, albeit with some tinkering with its renderer, shaders, and a few other systems.

According to the trailer (which you can have a gander at above), it'll be coming to Steam in early access some time this year. It being a standalone thing certainly might suggest that it has the all-clear from Valve, which wouldn't be that surprising given how chill the studio is with this kind of thing - I'll remind you of that OG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> that came outâ€¦ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-is-fully-launched-for-real">half a decade ago apparently</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a shooty person, nor have I ever even played Counter-Strike, but I do love a good fan project like this, and judging from the comments on the trailer, fans of the original shooter seem pretty pumped about this one.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is just not having a very good time on PC. The game only launched on Steam just last week, where it was quickly discovered that, oh dear, there are a lot of issues. Just a quick look at the game's reviews will let you in on its myriad of problems, but one of the biggest ones that's cropped up is an issue where <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1340990/discussions/0/828204828240984227/">save files are being completely wiped</a>, obviously quite an annoying bug especially if you've put a lot of time into the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, developer Koei Tecmo shared an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1340990/announcements/detail/616535451664123019">update post on Steam</a> noting that they are aware of the reported save data bug, and that they're "looking into" what's causing the problem. That's all well and good, but they did at least offer a couple of potential temporary solutions to the problem. In one part it could be down to your computer's documents folder being set to file sharing. Turning it off might help, but Koei doesn't guarantee anything. There's also a support page that has more specific details on this particular fix you can check out <a href="https://support.koeitecmo.info/hc/en-us/articles/23580170503193--Steam-Cannot-save-load">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Steam post also includes a way to retrieve your save data by heading to a specific folder on your computer, where you can rename the BACKUP.BIN file to SAVEDATA.BIN to hopefully get it back, but I'll let you read the post rather than explain here and have you complaining at me in the comments that I broke your computer somehow.
</p>
<p>
Steam's Cloud save function might also be able to restore your save, but Koei Tecmo notes that if you're asked which save file to keep, you should rename your local save data and store it somewhere else before using the Cloud data.
</p>
<p>
A proper patch for all of Rise of the Ronin's issues <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/507322442554803882">was promised when it launched on PC last week</a>, which is supposedly coming "soon", though it might still be worth holding off on jumping back in until that update arrives.
