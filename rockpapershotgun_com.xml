            <p>A little pigeon, huh? <a href="https://x.com/rosaslutzemburg/status/1655706412977209344">And she's your pal!</a> Well, isn't that great. <a href="https://x.com/tenstackstudios">Tenstack</a> are a tiny Swedish studio on a mission to make "digestible games so people won't choke playing them". They're currently making a new small game every 3 months, the latest of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-wings-deliveries">Little Wings Deliveries</a>. It's under a fiver, under an hour, and is maybe the third or fourth game at this point to have a skateboarding pigeon in. I do not mind. I have a headache. The soothing coos and soothing faceplants of a skateboarding pigeon are just what I need right now.</p>

<p>You play as Skye, a purple pigeon that's decided to stand out from her scavenging brethren by getting a bloody job, bless her. On her way to the Royal Postal Academy, you'll visit floating islands, grind, fly, meet weirdo inhabitants, and collect various objects of note. "Embark on a short, playful adventure in your cozy flying boat and sail through fluffy clouds," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457390/Little_Wings_Deliveries/">Steam</a>. "Discover floating islands and befriend their quirky citizens. Jump, roll, climb, and skate through Cloudburg."</p>
<p>Featuring:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Around 30 minutes to 1 hour of playtime!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sail through the clouds with your flying boat!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explore 5 different tiny flying islands!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meet a small cast of quirky characters!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Collect cool items like a skateboard, selfie stick, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I could berate this pigeon for building a wooden sky raft instead of using her perfectly good wings, but this is the kind of avian innovation we should be praising. The more calories the pigeons save, the less disastrous chippy assaults. Nicely done, Skye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2020, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> developer Robin Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-half-life-alyx-interview">told Katharine</a> (RPS in peace) that one of the hardest things in first-person shooter development is persuading people to look up. "One of the problems you always run into in an FPS is that players are really good at looking horizontally with their mouse, but they don't look up and down nearly as much," said Walker. "You've really got to work to make a player look up in FPS games."</p>
<p>You will definitely need to look up in Orbifold, a forthcoming shooter project from Hi-Rez programmer Chris Cullen. In this Unreal Engine 5 creation, firefights take place inside a giant, verdant ball akin to a miniature Dyson Sphere, but with no captive star. Players are gravitationally rooted to the exterior of the ball, meaning you can run all the way around the inside. There are also Halo-style launchers that punt you directly through the middle. Here's a slice of very WIP footage featuring some airborne android nuisances.</p><!--more-->

Cullen has been working on Orbifold in his spare time for a few years. The game doesn't have a store page or presskit just yet, though Cullen did show it off at <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/indie-game-showcase-2024">an event in Auckland, New Zealand last year</a>. I've scraped together a few more details from the project's <a href="https://x.com/OrbifoldGame/">Xitter feed</a>, with the stern caveat that all of this is, again, in a state of evolution, and that certain features might be abandoned.
</p><p>Cullen mentions rivers that flow around the inside of the sphere, tunnels and elevators beneath the surface, an upgrades system, various enemy android classes, co-op multiplayer, and a level editor that could be released alongside the game. Among the recent reveals is a Saturn Blast ability that lets you palm strike yourself skyward - this reminds me of Pharah's Concussive Blast in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Catch a video of it below.</p>

<p>Most tempting of all, for my money, are Cullen's ideas for grenades. He envisages slapstick varieties that launch attackers right across the sphere. You can imagine a co-op scenario where players punt groups of foes back and forth as though playing robot tennis.</p>
<p>You can imagine all kinds of things. Come, let us bask in the glow of hypotheticals. I'd love to see a Halo Warthog driver attempt to make sense of these conditions. I'd love to see players, enemies and pieces of debris getting stuck in a Lagrangian point at the sphere's centre. Ah, Lawbreakers, you died too young. A little less explosively, the playspace also recalls the ringworld from the amazing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> DLC expansion Echoes Of The Eye.</p>
<p> Hopefully Cullen will treat us to a proper announcement in the not-too-distant future. I'm not sure what exactly he does at Hi-Rez Studios, but it's obviously worth noting that, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a> aside, Hi-Rez are the creators of the momentous, gravity-snubbing FPS Tribes: Ascend. They sold the rights to that series to a spin-off subsidiary, Prophecy Games, in 2019. Prophecy released Tribes 3: Rivals in 2023, but it didn't set the internet alight and the developers have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-already-in-trouble-as-developers-shift-focus-elsewhere">shifted their attention elsewhere</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I fondly cherish my many memories of claustrophobia, confusion and terror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>. I can't get enough of the experience of being lodged behind the furniture like some teenager's hurriedly hidden copy of Loaded (or whatever the kids are reading now), rifle pivoting wildly between barricaded doors and windows, as enemy players bustle around the roof like awful, C4-toting pigeons.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I do feel the urge for some kind of proper, real-time tactical overview. Don't we have drones for that, Mr Clancy? As such, I'm moderately pleased to hear that Ubisoft are working on a top-down turn-based game set in the Rainbow Six universe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The rumour in question comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, who appear to have access to a whole wardrobe full of Ubisoft's dirty laundry, and are now skulking inside that wardrobe with a shotgun. The project is allegedly one or two years from release. As it stands, it's said to play a lot like XCOM, but with fixtures and a "loop" borrowed from Siege: you'll pick operators based on their skills to raid buildings and save hostages, all the Clancy favourites. It's said to last approximately 25-30 hours. The report has been corroborated by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, who adds in <a href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/the-switch-2-is-having-an-xbox-moment">the latest Dead Game newsletter</a> that the project is codenamed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slice-and-dice">Slice &amp; Dice</a> and is led by Elie Benhamou, the game director for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
The estimable Rock Paper Shotgun verdict on Breakpoint was that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-ghost-recon-breakpoint">broadly sucked arse</a>, despite a meticulously-woven open world. The rumoured "Slice &amp; Dice" concept seems promising, however, particularly if it can incorporate all the tricky things Siege players do with destructible surfaces. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the reports are legit, I imagine the major worry for the project's developers right now is the potential impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's carving out of a new Tencent-backed subsidiary for their most profitable games</a> - that's Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for a proper, top-down tactical overview of how this subsidiary will be run: the deal covers studios in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, but the number of individual developers involved remains to be determined. It's also not clear how developers might move back and forth between the new subsidiary and the rest of Ubisoft: Siege's development is led by Ubisoft Montreal, but features contributions from teams based in Toronto, Kyiv, Shanghai and Chengdu.

            <p>
Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani has criticised other games industry executives for letting rank-and-file developers take the fall for what he styles "very unsound business decisions" over the past two years.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
An extremely compressed recap: tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs across companies like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">Embracer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-announce-900-layoffs-across-naughty-dog-guerilla-insomniac-and-playstation-studios-worldwide">PlayStation</a> in the past year alone, as the industry's beefiest operators <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">struggle to meet the expectations of investors and repay debts</a> following a period of expansion kindled by a gaming boom during the worldwide Covid pandemic lockdowns. Much-hyped, functionally bogus new technologies such as NFTs, cryptocurrency and generative AI have yet to fill the hole, so costs are being cut instead.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is one of last year's big success stories, despite not having much buzz around it before launch. For all that, and despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-helldivers-2-was-at-its-lowest-arrowhead-looked-to-hello-games-and-no-mans-sky-to-keep-their-chin-up">very public difficulty keeping up with an unexpectedly large audience</a>, Jorjani says he's not interested in significant studio expansion. "I want us to be a role model for how to do sustainable growth, because the industry today is not in a good place," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a> (HELLO DRINGO) in an interview last week. 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of companies are shedding a lot of jobs. And it's not the people at the top that are losing their jobs, it's people who have moved half across the world to take jobs. And that's because of bad growth decisions made by business leaders who have taken stupid risks."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had more vitriol to share elsewhere in the chat.  "I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost... 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," he said. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?
</p>
<p>
"What's happening is that regular developers, are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry. Just because you can hire and triple in size in six months, doesn't mean you should. Or that it's the best thing for the studio's long term business health.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not saying don't grow, but do it in a way where you don't have to then let go of one third of the company because you made stupid decisions. I'm not going to hire a hundred people., I would like to do that and help people in the industry, but my first priority is to make sure that people have jobs for many years." 
</p>
<p>I've written up a bunch of stories about industry layoffs, rich with rhetoric about not taking decisions "lightly" and "aligning" for success. It's rare that the executives quoted in those announcements fall on their swords, or even lightly graze themselves with their swords in the form of some reduced annual compensation. The only caveat I will offer is that executive pay structures can be rather byzantine: many are paid partly in stock. As XenoFear points out below, this also means that their incomes are tethered to the overall financial performance of the company rather than whether they can keep individual developers employed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
