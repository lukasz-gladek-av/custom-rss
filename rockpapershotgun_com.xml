            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> arrives in full today, October 29th. Ahead of the gates to Arcadia finally being flung open to those who didn't fancy paying extra for early access, Obsidian have taken a stab at fixing some key issues and pesky bugs which've reared their heads so far. Good news, unless your roleplaying was set to be contingent upon being swallowed up by the ground or having to try and beat up an angry cupboard at some point in the space adventure.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a look through the notes of <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-hotfix-1040">hotfix 1.0.4.0</a>, I've spotted a couple of minor hiccups I ran into during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review playthrough</a>, these being Aza the culty companion regularly indicating a need to chat when there was no fresh convo to be had and Golden Ridge's Monastery sometimes being a bit confusing to navigate despite the objective markers' best efforts.</p>
<p>Some more critical bugs swatted include a "permanent fade to black" which could seemingly see the game unintentionally declare 'that's all folks' when you returned to a certain landing pad, the acidic body dematerializer stopping you from equipping weapons if you saved while using it, and companion Inez sometimes being tough to find after her first encounter. Obsidian say they've also "improved the accuracy of information displayed during the end-of-game slides".</p>
<p>Beyond those, there are plenty of more generic bugs you might get early in a game's lifespan, such as certain actions leading the player to fall through the world, quests not progressing, placeholder text popping up, and some collision misbehaviour. Amusingly, the studio add that "the game will no longer crash when interrupting certain NPC bark dialogue lines by interacting with or killing one of the participating speakers" and that you'll no longer run into in issue which would lead you to be be stuck in perma-combat because an enemy was trapped in a closet.</p><p>Finally, I've reached out to Obsidian for clarification regarding the very first bug the post lists. You see, it says PS5 players have run into issues with premium edition gear not being handed out properly, and underneath there's a note which reads as follows: "Unfortunately, the Consumerism Flaw being rewarded is not fixed in this patch and will be addressed in a future hotfix". Since I'm not 100% sure at a glance whether that's PS5 specific like the gear issues, I've opted to double check in case my running into that flaw when I did on PC was related to some bugginess, rather than the gag myself and others have since assumed it to be.</p>
<p>If word comes through that it's just a bug after all, I'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/so-it-turns-out-the-outer-worlds-2-spent-95-of-its-runtime-mocking-me-for-a-purchase-i-didnt-make">update this piece</a> and don the Moon Man helmet of shame.</p>
