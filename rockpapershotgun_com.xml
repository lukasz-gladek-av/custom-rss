            <p>"Worthless,’ they'd declared. Most NFTs were ‘worthless.’ The greatest artistic movement since The Big BSoD, the greatest proof of the power of the blockchain, the very future of the whole funging Infobahn, and the hedgie soybean-counters say it's all ‘worthless’," once wrote the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-nfts-are-worthless-how-come-i-have-written-a-third-novel-about-nfts-saving-the-future">greatest living prophet of our era</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/">once again </a>asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">Ian Games</a> for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which I won’t link because I respect the colour green too much, is “the ultimate Web3 competitive Turn-Based RPG”. You can only play the game via its own website, which I won’t link to because I respect the colour green too much. There’s also a trailer floating around. Not going to link to that either. Got a lot of respect for ‘things in motion’, I have, and this represents a terrible use of them.</p>
<p>As IGN point out, Ubisoft first announced it’d be sticking its head in the NFToilet bowl and daintily sampling the yellowing side-cruft about three years back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">in an earnings call</a>. Words like ‘revolution’ were used. The phrase ‘pay-to-earn’ was latched on to with glee. "[Blockchain] will imply more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot," chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>Contrast this to statements made by Ubisoft’s Philippe Tremblay to<a href="http://gi.biz/"> GI.biz earlier this year</a>, where the director of subscriptions said that a consumer shift "needs to happen" re: "Gamers are used to owning their games". Sure, blockchain and subscription-based access are different kettles of fish, but this does feel inconsistent. It’s almost like they’ll just say anything! Why even use words anymore! Why not just chortle and snort! You know you want to!</p>
<p>If you slept through or somehow mercifully forgot about the crypto craze of the last few years, you might be wondering why a game that lets you buy items as NFTs is a problem. First up, there’s the obvious pay-to-win element attendant on letting people cough up to forge more powerful characters - something that irks me less because of the holy sanctity of competitive game balance (although that’s enough to put me off playing), and more because these things are designed to play off the same vulnerabilities as gambling.</p>
<p>IGN report that the highest priced figurines - the characters you use to battle - are up on the marketplace at $63k. That doesn’t mean people are necessarily paying this much, mind, and those are outliers - most bits are a mere $300. Either way, it seems antithetical to anything actually interesting or valuable about game design. Why inspire organic investment when you can just invite players to join in a ghoulish sunk-cost spiral?</p>
<p>Secondly, the web3 industry have thus far failed to make a convincing case that this stuff isn’t a complete emissions disaster. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">According to one study</a>, Bitcoin alone uses the same amount of electricity each year as Argentina. For balance, I should point out that blockchain advocates argue that the technology can aid sustainability via “more accurate load monitoring, generation, and distribution in the grid through efficient use of data,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/">via Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>It's also hard to see the release of Champions Tactics right now as anything but an act of desperation from a Ubisoft evidently feeling financial pressure, or at least trying to get those numbers up before a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">potential buyout</a>.</p>
<p>I leave you with more words of wisdom from RPS’s dearly departed scryer of crud:</p>
<p>"A crack revealing strata of vape pens, LaserDiscs, and bags for life. All of it, trash. The melted bumper of the weed-green Tesla Model X once owned by... she couldn't even say his name. Everything, trash. Two empty bottles of Irn-Bru Kombucha rising like the legs of Ozymandias. 5arah snorted. <em>Look on my apes, ye Mighty, and despair!</em>"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">can be thin</a>, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc88_ZEfxg">Lionel Hutz</a> that quote: "Nazis? I hate <em>these</em> guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.</p>
<p>I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.</p><!--more-->
<p>I saw this on the start-up screen during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">my hands-on with the game</a> a few weeks ago. I meant to email for a copy of the text and write it up, but I forgot, and then those chancers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/">Gamespot</a> did an article, so here I am playing Journo Come Lately. Here's the disclaimer in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a fictional story, inspired by historical events and characters. Names, characters, organizations, locations, and events are either imaginary or depicted in a fictionalized manner, not intended to disrespect any historical or cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's likely just the usual legal arse-covering, of course. The game itself might be bruisingly frank about the fash, but there's nothing to stop an opportunistic far-right chowderhead cherry-picking a screenshot or video for the sake of a meme, or modding the game to let you play as the goose-steppers.</p><p>It's also possible the disclaimer is designed to ensure compliance with Germany's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/germany-lifted-its-ban-on-nazi-imagery-in-video-games-thats-great.html">qualified lifting of prohibitions on depictions of Nazis in video games back in 2018</a>, following which "symbols of unconstitutional organisations can be used in games in individual cases, as long as those symbols serve an artistic or scientific purpose, or depict current or historical events."</p>
<p>Still, it does look a bit ridiculous. This is Indiana Jones! I'm curious about whether the developers have any internal guidance about how to avoid counter-intuitively glorifying Nazis while teaching you to beat them to death. I guess you could argue that Indiana Jones And The Great Circle might inadvertently build a little sympathy given that it is basically a Third Reich Bullying Simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony have shut down Firewalk Studios, the developers behind ill-fated multiplayer hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, and confirmed that the game will not be returning to stores. In doing so, they are effectively striking a line through a big, red $200 million in their books - a number that some report is only part of the loss. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Certain] aspects of Concord were exceptional," said Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony's Studio Business Group in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">a press release</a> yesterday, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p>
<p>"After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."</p>
<p>In another example of a businessman using "sunset" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">poetically obfuscate</a> a painful closure (when you open a studio, you do not "dawn" it), Hulst suggests that the shooter scene is crowded and it was difficult for the game to draw a crowd. </p>
<p>"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving," he said, "and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title."</p>
<p>That's putting it lightly. Concord launched to little fanfare and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">taken offline just three weeks afterwards</a> - a painfully quick hobbling by Sony. The game was removed from storefronts and players who paid for the game at launch were offered refunds. Back in 2023, our Katharine (RPS in peace) wrote about all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">the doomed multiplayer shooters</a> lining up at the PlayStation showcase. She predicted that most would not survive six months. Concord did not even make it one. </p>
<p>"We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area," said Hulst.</p>
<p>"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing [Sony Interactive Entertainment]."</p>
<p>The game saw an initial investment of $200 million, according to sources who <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">spoke to Kotaku</a>. But that outlet also notes that this figure doesn't cover the entirety of development, or the cost of Sony buying the studio along with the rights to Concord as a piece of intellectual property. Just how much Sony lost on this game, they're unlikely to state plainly. </p>
<p>Alongside the closure of Firewalk, another studio has been given a bullet in the back of head at sunset. Neon Koi, a studio who have been working on an action game for mobile phones, was also closed. </p>
<p>"Both decisions were given serious thought," said Hulst, "and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PUBG Corporation and Krafton have just gone and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-arc">Project Arc</a>, a top-down 5v5 shooter "inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>". To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There's also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team's vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it's yet another 5vs5 shooter…</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As mentioned above, the attacking team's aim is to hack into a "hidden Crypt" on a map, all of which seem to be small buildings promoting close-quarters fights. To get to the crypt, they're to use grenade launchers and "explosive hammers" to break through walls or get the jump on baddies. Meanwhile, the defenders can barricade walls, chuck gas grenades, or pop mobile cover to counteract the raid.</p>

<p>Success seems to rely on getting sightlines on your enemies, or robbing them of theirs. That seems to be achieved through, say, chucking a stun grenade to suddenly reduce an enemy's cone of vision drastically. Or maybe, extending you and your allies' vision cones by lighting up a segment of the map over in the distance. It's a neat idea and one that could make for some Hotline Miami-esque duels between players in confined spots.</p><p>Weirdly, it reminds me a bit of League Of Legends. In the sense that a lot of League's map is permanently fog-of-warred, so good players and teams gain vision control by placing Wards (these light up the fog-of-war) in clever spots. A lot of fights (and matches) can be won or lost based on these Wards and who's spotted who first. I'd imagine the same philosophy rings true in Project Arc.</p>

            <p>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-3">Wasteland 3</a>, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games.

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/">Steam page</a> describes it as a “first-person, narrative-focused survival horror” (you’ve got a bad thing chasing you, one of those), but I also would have accepted “Grimdark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>”, which sound facetious but is actually one heck of a sell. Your very smart monke, Penn, is escaping from a lab with a bunch of other test animals, including a little rat mate named Trip who lives on your gravity gun and does a little jump whenever you fire it.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off a similar sort of grimy, unnerving tech to Brotherhood’s previous games. This is good. It also does that horror game trailer thing where it has a bunch of kids singing the Barney The Dinosaur theme really slowly. This is bad and stupid. It’s got a massive tortoise in it. It also contains potassium benzoate etc. Most bad-ly of all, it’s not actually out until 2026. So why am I writing about it now?!</p>
<p><em>Monke.</em></p>
<p>Or Chimp, I suppose, although if you were about to type a comment along those lines, I would first suggest you make sure you know your phylum and genus from your ligma. Feel free to ask about that last one. Here are some more deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 3D first-person, narrative-focused survival horror game, you play as Penn, a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility, where every corner hides new terror.
