            <p>
I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a majority of the data that various AI models train themselves on do so without getting any sort of permission to do so. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, as they say, though in the case of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, they probably shouldn't have taken that lesson to heart. That's because Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) has requested that the AI developer stops using Japanese media to train its text-to-video model Sora.
</p>
<p>
A touch of context: CODA is a Japanese trade association that represents some of the biggest media businesses in the country. It has a big focus on anti-piracy measures, particularly to do with anime and manga, but in general is about protecting the copyright of Japanese media. You'll be no stranger to some of the names on the list, as it includes the likes of Bandai Namco and Square Enix, as well as for anime companies like Toei Animation and Studio Ghibli.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that request! In a <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">post shared last week</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">Eurogamer</a>), CODA wrote that they have "confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images. CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data."
</p>
<p>
It goes on to note that Sora 2 operates on an opt-out system, meaning a company has to put in a request if it wants its intellectual property removed from the dataset. The issue is that Japan's copyright system doesn't work like that, as you need to get consent before you use any copyrighted works.
</p><p>
CODA's requests are twofold. First, "In the operation of Sora 2, CODA requests that its members’ content is not used for machine learning without their permission," and second, "OpenAI responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."
</p>
<p>
I feel it's important to note that this isn't saying CODA or any of the companies they represent are anti-AI, and that this is more a concern over the use of their respective bits of copyright. Even before AI, you've likely seen fan games and the like receive takedown notices because of their potential to misrepresent a particular work. But something like Sora 2 allows this to be done at scale, so even if you and I know that copyright just exists to protect the interests of big businesses, you can at least see why this is being done.

            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p>Tabletop wizard and cool glasses-wearer <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-mike-pondsmith">Mike Pondsmith</a> has teased having "ways" to bring Johnny Silverhand back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel. Actor and serial whoa merchant Keanu Reeves hasn't been shy about being open to reprising the role were the opportunity to crash through his door waving some mantis blades about, but reconciling such a thing with the events of the first game could prove a bit complex.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Pondsmith's let loose potential details about Cyberpunk 2, which developers CD Projekt have otherwise remained pretty tight-lipped about while they work away at it. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-city-like-chicago-gone-wrong-michael-jordans-legacy">Back in May</a>, he alluded to having chatted to a dev at the studio about a city which "feels more like Chicago gone wrong" that's visited during the course of the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Pondsmith said more words during a recent interview on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc">CD Projekt livestream</a>. "You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again," he mentioned, alluding to Reeves' <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">declariation of being down to return</a> to the role. "I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me."</p><p>The tabletop man refused to elaborate any further, as people who mention having mysterious ways to accomplish things often do. I assume the obvious way would be to have a Punch and Judy-style Silverhand puppet narrate the main menu, as the moon man of fellow RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> does. Think about it, every time there's a plot twist, he can have a sarcastic moan about you, a gonk, having gonkishly erred in trusting certain chooms, gonkishly. He'd have seen it coming years before you did, gonkchoom.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the only answers that'd make much sense would be if the sequel turns out to be a prequel to the events of the first game, or leans into flashback at certain points as that first Cyberpunk does. Either that, or some nonsense about there being extra hard drives knocking about somewhere in the real or net bits of the Cyberpunk universe with even more copies of the Silversonality on them.</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'd prefer it if Silverhand's story concluded in the first game, and the sequel moves on to fresh ground with minimal retreading. A brief cameo via flashback might be cool, but isn't worth doing just for the sake of it. In this interview, Pondsmith mentioned how blown away he was by CD Projekt getting Idris Elba for Phantom Liberty, and half jokes that he'd like to see Scarlett Johansson next. Sure, why not, but I reckon Cyberpunk's better off not being totally stuffed to the gills with every celeb possible, like a cyberware-heavy Christmas pantomime. That's what keeps the odd cameo in a role which fits the actor being cast feeling special.</p>
