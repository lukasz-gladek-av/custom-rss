            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomwood">Gloomwood</a> opened the year not with a whimper, but with a town - a Hightown! Right on January 1st, a fresh update and new area (The Hightown District) arrived in the early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game. This new district is very vaguely described as the game's "most vertical open area" yet, and it certainly looks as suitably gloomy as the rest of the game.
</p>
<p>
One of the big new additions alongside the area is a new enemy type, the hoggish constable. The launch trailer offers little to go on on how they might behave, though I imagine the pig and police imagery might offer a hint as to the kind of brutality they might enact upon you if you're spotted.

<p>
There are a few new, as a mostly detail-less Steam post explains, toys to pick up in the update too. One of these toys is a revolver, albeit one with a scope attachment that looks like it may be useful for taking out enemies from afar. There's also a firebomb, which I'm going to assume does exactly what it says on the tin.
</p><p>
This update also serves a reminder for me personally that I really should pick up Gloomwood one of these days. As much as I want to ignore it, the passage of time has resulted in this game having already been in early access for more than three years now. Back when it launched, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomwoods-grimy-stealth-playground-deserves-better-than-the-agony-of-early-access">Alice B. had a little go with it</a> and found it to be quite good, but also simply unfinished, lamenting how hard it was to recommend when the world wasn't ready for anyone to put their skills to the test. Perhaps all these years on, it's time to dive in.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up or wishlist Gloomwood on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/">here</a>.

            <p>
When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> rocks up, rakes in a bunch of success and critical acclaim, alongside the top game of the year prize at Geoffie's Lil Night of Ads, there will be certain expectations of what's next. It's always what's next! Because there has to be more. But whatever more ends up being for developer Sandfall Interactive, the team is trying to make sure they don't just bow down to what people want from them.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>) in a recent interview, chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse shared that he feels "a bit of pressure" from both lovers and critics of the game for the studio's follow-up, but ultimately "it's not so important to us." He went on to say that they'll have "time to get really focused into the next game. We have some great ideas we're so excited to explore, and we don't start from the same point. The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff."
</p>
<p>
Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who apparently had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-lead-writer-had-apparently-never-played-a-video-game-before-writing-it">never played a game before writing this one</a>, echoed these thoughts, even if she did note that she's "a bit of a people pleaser." With that in mind, she says it's "always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game." 
</p>
<p>
Svedberg-Yen does admit to thinking about these expectations from time to time, but when it comes to creative decisions, they always make sure to be guided by their own personal taste as opposed to what people want from them. "I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," she said. "So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."
</p>
<p>
Let's just cross our fingers that whatever's next causes just a bit less discourse about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. Please. I've had enough.
