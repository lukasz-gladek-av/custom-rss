            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> developers Red Hook have announced that game files for Mythic's troubled boardgame adaptation will be given away to project backers, after grimly concluding that Mythic are no longer able to manufacture or deliver the thing.
</p>
<p>
The Darkest Dungeon boardgame was Kickstarted in 2020, soaking up $5.7 million in funding. Based in Luxembourg, Mythic Games have done well out of crowd-funding, raising over $19 million in five years, but they have been struggling financially nonetheless. They <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1162110258/darkest-dungeon-the-board-game/posts/3557431">asked DD boardgame backers to chip in more money</a> in 2022, after material and shipping costs spiked amid the Covid pandemic and the opening stages of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mythic finally went into liquidation this December, reportedly following a criminal investigation into fraudulent behaviour and misappropriation of funds, which was terminated for lack of evidence. The company’s closure has left several projects worth millions of Kickstarter dollars in purgatory. There are many Ancestor quotes we could invoke here, I guess. I'm going with "more dust, more ashes... more disappointment."

</p>
<p>
Prior to biting the dust, Mythic managed to ship the first of two “waves” of Darkest Dungeon boardgame materials to backers. Amid the liquidation proceedings, a representative of the company also told <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/10/darkest-dungeon-board-game-maker-mythic-games-officially-liquidated-fails-to-deliver-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-crowdfunding-projects/">Board Game Wire</a> that they would provide backers with the STLs – aka, digital 3D models that you can use to print game pieces - for both waves.</p>
<p>This was actually impossible at the time, however, because Mythic don’t own the copyright on Darkest Dungeon's designs, but a former Mythic staffer has now secured permission from Red Hook to share the files.
</p>
<p>
“As many of you know, the financial situation at Mythic Games has been strained for the past several years,” Red Hook <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">write on their official site</a>. “We have been keeping an eye on the situation, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, at this point, Mythic Games is no longer able to manufacture or deliver the Darkest Dungeon board game.
</p><p>
“We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the Darkest Dungeon name,” the post continues. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many Darkest Dungeon fans. 
</p>
<p>
“Recently, we were contacted by an ex-Mythic employee who asked for our blessing to distribute the project files to all backers. While we at Red Hook don't own or control the board game files themselves, we were happy to give our permission for our copyrighted material within those files to be distributed to backers for non-commercial use.”
</p>
<p>
If you backed the Darkest Dungeon boardgame, you should now have an email from the Kickstarter campaign with a link to “all game files, including files of the rules, 3D models and more”. If you haven’t received the email, give darkestdungeonrescuefiles@gmail.com a shout.
</p>
<p>
It’s good that some of the project has been salvaged, but email attachments aren’t a patch on getting a chunky new Crusader figurine in the post. “Unfortunately, Red Hook has neither the board game manufacturing expertise nor have we had the ability to divert funds of the scale required to remove whatever obstacles Mythic has faced without endangering our own operations,” the videogame's creators conclude on their site. “We only hope that this final gesture can be a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing situation.”

            <p>Well, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shush-helldivers-2s-redacted-regiment-warbond-is-all-about-being-sneakily-stealthy-and-silently-suppressed">last one</a> might have only appealed to folks open to taking on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-gets-new-stealth-missions-today-and-its-super-slimmed-install-size-version-is-finally-ready-to-take-over">a mission that demands a bunch of crouch-walking</a>, but you can't say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s second warbond of 2026 isn't offering plenty of bang for your buck. It's got an exploding hammer. There's other stuff in this Siege Breakers warbond too, but I'll be honest, none of that can boast being a stick with a thing that goes boom taped to the end.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let me crack open the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">notes</a> for this warbond, which is set to release on February 3rd, and wax lyrical about the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer. To be fair to Arrowhead, they've arguably downplayed it in marketing terms, at least when it comes to wordly description. "This sledgehammer can do straight smashing, or it can have an explosive charge attached to its head to drive the point home," they write.</p>
<p>Ok. Annnnnnnnnnndddd there it is in the trailer being bonked down onto the bonce of an automaton by a diving Helldiver who subsequently disappears in a big exploding cloud of fire and explosions. Naturally, it seems that following a killer blow like that, you can just dust yourself off, stick a new explosive charge to your hammer's head and bash on. All in all, I'd say there's plenty of potential for slapstick antics and kills worthy of being uploaded to YouTube with a title that's just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_t9z9KWZE">Steve Urkel's catchphrase</a> in all caps.</p><p>While we're here, I suppose I'll tell you about the rest of the stuff in Siege Breakers. There's the returning LAS-16 Trident from the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>, this time with six fireable beams instead of three. Building on the hammer's explodey vibes are a belt-fed grenade launcher dubbed the GL-28 and a single-shot missile launcher called the EAT-411 Leveller. On second thought, the Leveller might be just as fun as the hammer.</p>
<p>Rounding out the major additions is a "spherical, projectile-blocking shield" you can lob out for some cover,  a studded heavy armour set dubbed the SA-8 Ram, and a medium set called the SA-7 Headfirst. Both of the latter come with a passive ability that regenerates your stamina whenever you take damage, meaning you can go all night long. Well, at least until you run out of health.</p>

            <p>
Good news everybody! Geralt of Rivia is dead. He lies beneath a pile of naked, sculpted, drunken bodies in a castle ballroom. Actually, that’s not right - he’s been eaten by a dragon. Actually, that’s not right either - he drowned himself in a flagon of syrup. Fair audience, please consider which of these tragic eventualities is most befitting of your hand-claps and progression points. None of them meet your standards? Then I, Dandelion, must sing Geralt’s death anew.
</p>
<p>
Nerial and Devolver Digital have partnered with CD Projekt RED to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-the-witcher">Reigns: The Witcher</a>. I’m sure I don’t need to explain that this is a new version of Nerial’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reigns-review-pc">cherished</a> card-swiping narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, which takes place in The Witcher’s grotty and magical medieval universe. The game casts you as temporarily embarrassed ‘master poet’ Dandelion, who is both Geralt’s best mate and very often, the biggest pain in his arse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Dandelion and Geralt have a bet on that Dandelion can’t become an ‘immortal bard’ in one year. To win the bet, Dandelion must spin progressively fancier, longer, sillier and more thrilling tales about Geralt’s heroism, all of which seemingly end in his demise.</p>
<p>As in regular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, this is done by drawing event cards and swiping left or right to make decisions that fill or empty four gauges at the top of the screen. There’s also a combat system, which sees you tapping to make Geralt hop left or right on a grid of descending damage, spell and attack icons. Between tales, you’ll channel your audience’s initially grudging applause into level-ups that unlock new starting story concepts and modifiers. "Geralt The Bathed", for example, makes Geralt stink less, improving his standing with certain kinds of people, though I imagine there will be repercussions of the “got smelled stalking a werewolf” variety.
</p><p>
I’ve had a quick fiddle with a preview build, and this seems like it’ll scratch your itch if you enjoy either The Witcher or Reigns, though it has yet to surprise me, and is likely best played on a phone. The writing is as daft and bouncy as you’d expect from both Dandelion and the writers of Reigns. The Reigns artstyle is perhaps a bit worn-out at this stage - there have been three other spin-offs, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns-game-of-thrones">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a> - but it remains crisp and suave with some nifty takes on Tarot. The music readily conjures the taverns of the Nilfgaardian Empire.
</p>
<p>
I’m interested to see whether there are nods to the other cardgames in The Witcher universe – both the porno pin-up collecting from the 2008 original game, which we Don’t Talk About Nowadays, and the more recent, beloved Gwent. Mostly, though, I just want to see how far Nerial can warp Geralt and The Witcher universe via Dandelion’s improvisations, particularly given that CD Projekt are dialling up the seriousness with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Do a custard pie-based death, next, Dandelion. You can make it some kind of sex scene, if you wish.
