            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/supermassive-games">Supermassive Games</a>, best known for developing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-pictures">The Dark Pictures</a> Anthology, have announced they've begun the consultation process for a round of redundancies that'll affect "up to 36" staff. As part of this, sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Directive 8020 has had its release delayed to early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supermassive have confirmed that the development of puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a> hasn't been affected by these job cuts, with that game still being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better">on track to come out October 10th</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the studio blamed these layoffs on a need to "better align" with the games industry being "a challenging and ever-evolving environment", whatever that means.</p>
<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected," Supermassive wrote, "We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans."</p> <div>

<p>This latest round at layoffs follow the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">laying off around 90 workers in February 2024</a>, citing similar reasoning to that which they've employed here in a social post that looked pretty similar too.</p>
<p>Directive 8020, a standalone entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">first leaked back in 2022</a>. Supermassive pencilled in a 2025 release for it as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">a proper announcement last summer</a>, which showed off a game the very much looked like it'd be putting the phrase 'in space, no one can hear you scream' to the test. It's all about a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash landing on a planet and its crew then having further bad times as they're hunted down by an alien organism in true Xenomorphy fashion.</p>
<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," reads the first line of Directive 8020's blurb, which I wish didn't vaguely feel like it unintentionally reflects the mood in the games industry right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If I'm interpreting the press materials for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gossamer-matrix">Gossamer Matrix</a> correctly, this is an FPS in which you might accidentally stuff a chocolate bar into your AK47 while trying to reload. The result will not be a fusillade of chocodrops. Instead, you will be gunned down like the miserable office slob you absolutely are. So keep your workspace tidy, chief.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my desk as I type these words. It contains: a piece of paper with "gel" written on it, purpose unknown; a stolen Cafe Nero mug, never cleaned; Vikram Chandra's memoir Geek Sublime; and a bag of raisins. I do not own a gun, because this is the UK and one of the UK's few advantages is that the vast majority of people don't own guns, but if I did own a six-shooter and were lured into a gunfight right now, I guarantee I'd be stuffing raisins into the chamber while choking to death on my own bullets.</p><!--more-->

<p>Which is hopefully the kind of doofiness that will make Gossamer Matrix fun. In this, gloriously non-widescreen and Haribo-coloured arcade shooter from catmilk, you are a security guard tasked with rescuing your company's board members from the invading forces of Mallow Corp. To do this you must wrangle with a "physics-based interaction scheme" that obliges you to load guns by dragging bullets onto them and yanking at their bits. All the while managing a screenful of other stuff that has minimal ballistic potential.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a clear sense of things in the absence of a demo, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002840/Gossamer_Matrix/">the Steam page</a> fills in the picture somewhat. "Things can quickly get overwhelming if you don't take the time to keep your workspace clean," it notes. "Empty magazines, candy wrappers, and dirty syringes will crowd your vision and obstruct your pockets if not disposed of properly, and being distracted on the clock is not a luxury you can afford."</p>
<p>This looks and sounds like a hoot and a holler. I now consider games with dedicated reloading buttons desperately quaint. If you're wondering where you've come across this before, it turns out Alice0 (RPS in peace) listed it as one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">most anticipated games of 2023</a>. That was before I started at RPS, mind you, a period popularly known as the "Bozo's Interval", so I feel no shame about posting the game again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-acid-bright-office-shooter-gossamer-matrix-you-have-to-reload-while-managing-a-deskful-of-junk]]></content:encoded>
