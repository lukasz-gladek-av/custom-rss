            <p>Ubisoft are nowhere to be found during this year's not-E3 season, meaning there's no opportunity for the French publisher to announce six new games they'll never release. I still crave a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> fix, however, and Mudang: Two Hearts delivered, kinda. It's Korean, it's got fast-moving rage zombies, but it's also got men shimmying up pipes, cinematic brawls, and a rapid-cut montage of knife crimes. You should watch the trailer.

<p>"In the not-too-distant future, the divided nations of South and North Korea are on the verge of reunification," begins the game's blurb. "On the day when the historic bill was set to pass, a mystery terrorist group attacks the South Korean National Assembly, throwing the entire nation into chaos. Sent to uncover the truth, a North Korean soldier stumbles upon a K-Pop star and is given a new mission: protect the girl who can unravel it all."
</p>
<p>Hard to say which part of that seems less realistic, but the important thing is it's described as a stealth action thriller. Whether I'm a Fisherlike or a K-pop star, all I want to do is shimmy along ledges and press some QTE prompts during hand-to-hand combat with a man whose head is magnetically drawn towards the nearest mirror.
</p>
<p>That's about all we know for now, but Mudang will apparently launch sometime in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A 3D sequel to the masochistic 2010 platformer Super Meat Boy was announced at the Xbox showcase. It's simply called Super Meat Boy 3D and it basically looks exactly how you'd expect in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Note to meat marketers: the green pipe fakeout only works for anyone watching the showcase live. Everyone else knows this is about the little bleedy guy by the time they click on the video. But good effort. </p>
<p>As you can see, the trailer shows a lot of bear traps, chainsaws, sawblades, lasers, slime blocks, molten steel, and angry robots. I can't really stand a 3D platformer, to be frank. Not since Gex. But I'm sure plenty of Super Meat Stans will get stuck in. </p>
<p>A sequel to the original platformer, Super Meat Boy Forever, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/super-meat-boy-forever-is-out-now">released in 2020</a> but it was an auto-runner and maybe didn't hit the previous game's sweet spot of tough-but-fair fatality that some precision platforming nerds loved. This sequel is made by the same studio, Team Meat, but the original developer of the little red eejit, Edmund McMillen, is off making something else entirely: an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have">"endless cat-breeding RPG"</a> called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>. Checks out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
