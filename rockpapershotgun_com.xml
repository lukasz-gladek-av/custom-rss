            <p>If you like getting Warhammered and having a scrap as a space marine, then here's some good news. Following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-siege-mode-is-out-letting-you-fight-endless-waves-of-tyranids-and-the-other-less-good-enemy">siege mode</a> last week, developers Saber Interactive have confirmed that it'll be getting second year of free and paid updates.</p>
<p>Hey, it's something to help quench your bloodlust while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a> to become more than a glint in the eye of a dev working on a big gun to be wielded by a big lad in big armour.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber have confirmed this extra year of "both free and DLC content included in a new yearly season pass" in their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225">community update</a>, outlining that you can expect it to include "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and ...more".</p>
<p>Before that kicks off, the game'll be getting the "large-scale" 10.0 update in September, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of its release. That update'll include the a new PvP mode that was originally set to be added in the next patch, 9.0, which'll now solely be about balancing tweaks. The new mode'll be Chaos vs Chaos on a new map, and will let players take control of the Hellbrute.</p>
<p>As for gear, 10.0 is bringing new Chaos armours for you to rock while you take on that new mode, as well as a Power Axe you'll be able to slap baddies up with if you prefer to swap your guns for melee mashing. There'll also be a new class, the Techmarine, which Saber are keeping their cards close to their chest on for now, but we can safely assume will love a good wrench.</p>
<p>There'll be more info on the 10.0 update's contents coming in the studio's community updates over the next couple of months, because woe betide the dev team that spunks all of its update deet reveals at once.
