            <p>Here are some orc names I quite like. Haters will tell you these “aren’t real orcs”, but those fools are forever trapped in a stifling prison forged from the failures of their own imaginations. Suck it, haters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ironspoon Rumpgouger</li>
<li>Football Groinsmasha</li>
<li>Krumpstopher Waagghken</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sigmarxism/comments/1g5f32j/korl_morx/">Korl Morx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An orc that even these despicable haters are forced to admit is real, however, is Gorbad Ironclaw. If you look very carefully, you may spot him below, in the new trailer for Omens Of Destruction - the next expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>. We've got a release date, too: 12th December.</p>

<p>The folks at Creative Assembly sent me a document, and in that document is some information about what’s to come in both Omens Of Destruction and the accompanying free update. If I were so inclined, I could write this information out in a natural, conversational tone, interspersed with my own commentary. As I’m sure many of you are aware, however, that commentary would mostly just be me going “wow! Neat!”. Instead, here’s the free-range information, uncorked and unbesmirched by the flaky preservatives of opinion. </p>
<blockquote><strong>SKULLTAKER, THE HERO SLAYER (KHORNE) </strong>
<p>Cloak of Skulls: Skulltaker must seek-out and defeat powerful enemy lords across the heroic
pantheon of the Warhammer World. With each skull added to his cloak, powerful new
abilities and traits can be earned and upgraded.
</p>
<p>A force of daemonic destruction, Skulltaker excels at hunting down and duelling enemy lords
before cleaving through ranks of troops with his two-handed Slayer Sword. His Cloak of
Skulls passive ability grants increasing spell resistance and ward saves the more he kills.</p>
<p>New units from the Blood God’s domain enter the fray, including two legendary heroes;
Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm, followed by a host of acolytes including the
Bloodspeaker, Slaughterbrute, Bloodbeasts, Wrathmongers, Skullreapers, and Khorngors.</p>
<strong>GORBAD IRONCLAW, THE BRUTAL UNIFIER (ORCS) </strong>
<p>Da’ Plan: A tenacious tactician (for an Orc), Gorbad must experiment with unique battle
strategies for his armies to employ, granting a deadly of exotic battle bonuses and army
compositions that can overcome any challengers.</p>
<p>Riding into battle atop his fierce Warboar, Gnarla, Gorbad penetrates the enemy lines with
devastating charges before engaging in close combat with his mighty axe, Morglor ‘the
Mangler’. His ‘Da Great Leader’ ability which activates when troops are in his vicinity,
granting increased melee attack and defence.</p>
<p>New units joining Gorbad’s Waaagh! include the legendary hero Snagla Grobspit
accompanied by warriors such as the Savage Orc Great Shaman, Night Goblin Big Boss, Black
Orc (Axe &amp; Shield), Mangler Squiqs, Colossal Squig, Arachnarok (Flinger), and Bolt Throwa.</p>
<strong>GOLGFAG MANEATER  (OGRE KINGDOMS) </strong>
<p>Mercenary Contracts: Ever keen to lace his pocket with gold, Golgfag helps clients
throughout the Warhammer World settle their warring disputes by taking on all wars they’re
involved in and conducting hostile actions against their enemies for handsome reward.</p>
<p>An anti-infantry blender, Golgfag tears through hordes of infantry with the aid of barbaric
weaponry. His globe-trotting nature also gives him access to a variety of exotic abilities such
as Dead Eye which allows him to take a powerful shot from his pistol causing huge damage</p>
<p>New units joining Golgfag’s mercenary brigade include the Legendary Hero Bragg the
Gutsman as well as the Ogre Paymaster, Bruiser, Golgfag’s Maneaters, Pigback Riders, Blood
Vultures, Yhetees and Thundertusks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good word of Korl Morx has failed to reach Creative Assembly, however, so you will have to pay for all this stuff (please don’t tell me “that’s not how communism works” I just wanted to write ‘Korl Morx’ again). If you don’t feel like spending any money, though, there are some free goodies, too. These’ll include the series 100th Legendary Lord, Khorne champion Arbaal The Undefeated, who’s defeat trait I’d look forward to reading if there wasn’t already twelve other characters with some version of ‘the undefeated’ in their names. You’ll also get faction updates for Ogres, Khorne, and - my boys and yours - the greenskins.</p>
<p>Wow! Looks neat! I especially liked the part where I get some more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> to play with. Easily my favourite part!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Video games in general have a surplus of weapons. It's gotten to the point that if I had any freelance budget, I'd commission somebody to count them up. Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we're talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those <a href="https://mr21.github.io/space-object-comparison/#earth,moon">comparison pages for stars and planets</a> - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game's armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. "Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers," I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.</p><!--more-->
<p>In the absence of an artform-wide disarmament project, with shame-faced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventurers handing over their runic heirlooms to local constables, games could at least teach their players to think more about each individual weapon: its design and history, how it fits into some on-going story. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bladesong">Bladesong</a> seems helpful on that front. It's a blacksmithing game where you make swords to play out the tale of a mighty fortress, "one of mankind's last remaining bastions after the gods have banished themselves".</p>

<p>It doesn't <em>look</em> a lot like blacksmithing, mind you. It's a spotlit model-editing garage that burgeons with icons, fields and sliders for things like "distal taper" and "flamboyance". There is minimal hammering, as far as I can see. No actual in-game singing either, despite the title. I feel like there genuinely are blacksmiths who sing to their creations, to regulate the rhythm of their strokes. I guess you can always sing at the screen if it helps with your APM.</p><p> If you dislike crafting screens in video games, this is your worst nightmare. But I'm already enjoying both the nerdy extravagance of options, and the accompanying requirement to meet specific buyer requests that factor into the aforesaid narrative. Somebody needs a lightweight training sword - perhaps they're a juvenile Chosen One embarking on that very first tutorial rat hunt. Somebody else wants a blade that's hefty and not too long, so that they can slash with it in tight spaces - perhaps this particular individual is a city guard who patrols a lot of narrow alleyways. Somebody else just wants a shitload of pretentious glowing sigils. He's likely a witcher.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if we had the option of deliberately failing commissions and saddling people we dislike with minimally hardened or heat-treated swords. A few days later, there's a story in the papers about some git noble splintering his bejewelled katana against a peasant's scythe while trying to collect taxes. </p>
<p>Sadly, the Steam page doesn't give much sense of the story and how much control you have over it. The morsels I sponge from the trailer suggest that there's a lot of text, but it's tersely phrased. Makes sense - there's no room for roundabout adjectives when you're commissioning weapons. It would be like making a rapier out of lazurite. Lazurite, incidentally, is a tectosilicate mineral often used in painting. I don't speak from any experience, but you probably shouldn't try to make a sword out of the stuff.</p>
<p>Bladesong will have a public playtest from 4th-13th December. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">You can sign up on the Steam page</a>. In the shorter term, I welcome any recommendations for other games in which you largely just make weapons for people. I know there are a few.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
