            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publishers Krafton have accused three recently ousted leads of "abandoning" their duties on the game, suggesting that this is to blame for it being delayed. That statement was almost immediately followed by one of the former Unknown Worlds bosses, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, writing in a Reddit post that a lawsuit's been filed by the trio against the company.</p>
<p>These are the latest twists in an ongoing saga that began with Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in to replace Cleveland, fellow co-founder Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">earlier this month</a>. That kicked off a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">war of words</a> between the two sides, punctuated by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">report from Bloomberg</a> which alleged Krafton's call to delay the game was made just before a $250 million bonus was set to be paid to Unknown Worlds staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Krafton claimed in <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">a statement</a> published late yesterday that "approximately 90%" of this bonus, tied to the dev team hitting revenue targets, was set to paid to the three ousted leads "with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2".</p>
<p>"However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them," they continued, "Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed." The publishers allege that "multiple requests" for Cleveland and McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director were declined by the leads.</p>
<p>"Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule," the statement adds, with the publishers writing that they're "committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees" working on the game. "We reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised," Krafton added, not quite explicitly stating that the remaining devs will definitely get the full $250 million.</p>
<p>So yeah, very much both barrels being pointed at the exiled leads. Enter Charlie Cleveland providing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">an update</a> via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> subreddit.</p>
<p>"We’ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story," he wrote after reiterating his claim that the game was ready for early access, "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</p>
<p>"As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well."</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is a saga that looks very much set to rumble on for the foreseeable, as part of what Cleveland summed up as "an explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community". We'll keep you updated.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former RPS sealife correspondent Nate once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">described the game Maneater</a> as "an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark", which stuck with me. The Jaws Effect is a reasonably well known phenomenon <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275954344_The_Jaws_Effect_How_movie_narratives_are_used_to_influence_policy_responses_to_shark_bites_in_Western_Australia">coined in a paper</a> that explores the impact the 1975 film had on Australian policy response to shark bites, although the term is now used a bit more broadly to refer to how sharks are villainised in pop culture - villainisation obviously being an absurdly human and dramatic concept to apply to a hungry or scared fish.</p>
<p>Jaws <a href="https://jeevoka.com/jaws-is-responsible-for-killing-a-colossal-amount-of-sharks/s">did actually result in an increase in shark culls</a>, but its lasting legacy has also been argued to be more insididous. Depending on whether you're looking at stats from the UN or from conservation charities, the number of sharks killed or mutilated and harvested each year for fins and other parts ranges between about 10 and 100 million, and it's been <a href="https://sharkstewards.org/how-jaws-influenced-shark-perception/">argued this continues</a> with relatively little pushback as compared to similar wildlife atrocities due to wide-reaching perception that ranges from apathy to vilification. A sharknado of lies, if you will.</p>

<p>It's a sort of reverse Finding Nemo effect - not the discredited idea that everyone rushed out and bought clownfish after seeing it, but the one that worker Sarah Wynn Williams writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People">in her book on Meta</a>, where a UN colleague in conversation tells her the Pixar films were the "single most impactful thing to actually protect the oceans over the last decade”. This is obviously a bit proverbial but the basic point that fictional media does stuff wot is also sometimes real should pretty much be a given by this point anyway.</p>
<p>All of which is the sort of shit that goes rushing through my head before I can get around to writing "lol look at the funny shark game". Even though, sure, the shark game <em>does</em> look funny. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shark-dentist">Shark Dentist</a> is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_Dentist">Crocodile Dentist </a>but with ray tracing and convincingly grimy teeth barnacles, set in an office that looks like the room from the first Saw film. The idea is you go poking around in a sedated shark's gumline and then act all shocked when it chomps your ears off.</p>
<p>Shark, quite famously, do not need the dentist because they're diligent flossers, and also because they replace their teeth frequently. This is fine. If this shark dentist was real they would be too stupid to live anyway, because they don't seem to have considered it might be prudent to bind the shark's jaws before getting in there with a buzzsaw. Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3423280/Shark_Dentist">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Intense Gameplay:</strong> Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Roguelike Mechanics:</strong> Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Tool Interaction:</strong> Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Organic Balance:</strong> Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's for "lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw", which reminds me I never asked Nate about his feelings on The Meg combining two of his great loves - sealife and Jason Statham. I'll report back. Shark Dentist's release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shark-dentist-is-about-operating-on-a-fools-idea-of-a-shark]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's time to get totally radical, dudefolks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the latest nostalgia-fest about avian athletes artfully acing acrobatic boardiness, drops in full today, July 11th. Though, thanks to pre-order early access meaning the game sort of released three days ago, its modding community is already off and running.</p>
<p>If you've spent the past few months watching old X Games reruns and thinking to yourself that all the shreddage might be better if Bob Burnqvist were an Edwardian nanny, a train chaser, or a gabagool enthusiast, I've got some good news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a glance at what THPS 3+4's Nexus Mods page has to offer as of this fine Friday, the answer is an awful lot of character skins swaps from modder Huckleberrypie, who's got a long and illustrious history of sticking different models into games. Here's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/barbieandthe12dancingprincesses/mods/3">Terry Honk</a> as the main character of Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses, a video game I had no idea existed until this morning.</p>
<p>They've clearly been working hard throughout these few early access days. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/11">Tommy Angelo</a> from the Mafia games, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/10">Tony Soprano</a> from the mafia game that was also a TV show, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/5">Snow White</a> from the Dwarven mafia, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/4">Elsa</a> from Frozen, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/3">the obligatory CJ</a> from GTA San Andreas - they're all here, swapped in for the Birdman and Brazilian prodigy Rayssa Leal while modders work out how to pull off standalone character additions.</p>
<p>For some reason, though, I can't take my eyes off one particular Huckleberrypie creation. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/12">Mary Poppins</a> from the 2018 film Mary Poppins Returns, which I haven't seen, but assume involves Mary Poppins coming back to force everyone to remember how to spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p>

<p>Along with the above video of Mary shredding the supercalifuck out of a park run, the modder's penned a backstory to explain her journey to skating superstardom. "Years after the events of the first film, Mary Poppins comes to the Bankses' aid when Michael's wife passed away and his family fell in dire straits due to the depression," it reads, "Mary clearly needed a break from all the turmoil her charges went through, and so she turned to her hobby of performing rock music and tearing up the park with her trusty skateboard."
</p>
<p>I don't care if it's the exact same narrative Huckleberrypie weaved for one of their multiple <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater1and2/mods/102">THPS 1+2 Mary Popins mods</a>, it's moving stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other mods on offer for 3+4 on release include a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/1">port of a 1+2 mod</a> that adds the likes of custom restarts and a free roam cam. Plus, there's the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/2">quick startup</a> for folks who can't stand three seconds of logo splashes. Oh, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/7">Master Chief</a> skating on a mini-tank.</p>
<p>Do you think Mary would have hit the 900 before Tony Hawk in real life, if she weren't a fictional character? I do, and if you disagree, you're just wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-drops-in-full-today-so-of-course-a-modder-already-has-mary-poppins-poppin-kickflips]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tides Of Torment, the next DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, has been pushed back from its original Summer release window to later in the year, with September onwards sounding the likeliest from a<a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75"> new blog post</a>.</p>
<p>And that's…honestly where the bad news ends, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the blog is filled with some exciting and pretty respectable thoughts about future updates. Even the reason for Tides Of Torment's delay ("the short answer was no", it didn't hit the team's standards) strikes me as a good sign, since it means the DLC team at least feel they've got the breathing room to not rush out something they're not happy with. It's too nice outside for my PC to be running the kind of temps 1000 angry sea elves are going to result in, anyway.</p>
<p>Ah, yes: Sea Elves are confirmed now, led by Sea Lord Aislinn. Expect more details from a new video in August, by the sound of it.</p>

<p>There's siege improvements coming to the Proving Ground beta branch later this month. If you asked Sigvald, he'd surely sound sceptical sieges can be salvaged from their shabby state and shone to the standard seen in superior <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy games</a>, but since Sofia have…already released some clever updates, I'm feeling <em>mildly optimistic</em> about whatever they've got planned here.</p>
<p>In August, Lizardmen and Tomb Kings are getting some quality of life shinies and updated starting traits, and generic Greenskin characters are getting some skill line buffs. And then…</p>
<blockquote><p>"On the topic of the road ahead, we also want to acknowledge the growing conversation we see about the game's future beyond Tides of Torment. We’ve seen a few folk asking for specific characters that might not fit in any of our current DLC formats, so we are exploring how we might introduce a smaller style of DLC that brings a single LL, or Hero Unit alongside a few favoured additions. We’re working out how these would fit with our schedules, but we have a good idea for who the first one could be, and she’s someone near and dear to your blood."</p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit is very likely a hint toward Vampire lord Neferata, but I'm more interested in what this might mean for future expansions. The blog later drops hints for a teaser for an announcement of a promise at CA's 25th anniversary bash in December for "one of the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> content packs ever created in the trilogy", which might have a few of you huffing the Clan Skurvy grog fumes if you've kept up with things. </p>
<p>One of the more credible lines of speculation I've seen is that this is some sort of End Times pack, marking the winding down of the trilogy in favour of Total Warty Thousand, itself expected to be announced as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">multiple new Total War games CA have hinted at</a>. But single lord or other smaller DLCs sound like a great way to extend the life of Warhammer 3 without requiring the resources of the bigger expansions. Also, Rich Aldridge said he likes Halfling Soup Tanks in a video once. Just saying. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates]]></content:encoded>
