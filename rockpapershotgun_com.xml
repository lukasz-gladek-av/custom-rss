            <p>
I missed my chance to write about Hollywood Animal when a certain Nic Reuben swooped in like a rival showbiz talent scout and pinched the summer Steam Fest demo from right under my nose, capitalising on the fact that I was stranded in an airport at the time. I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a very rude Minesweeper "homage"</a> instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

As you might guess from the title and my cunning intro allusions, Hollywood Animal is a tycoon game in which you set up your own film studio at the dawn of sound cinema. You'll buy and furnish buildings such as script and post-production departments, hire a bunch of actors, writers, producers and other minions, and get to work generating a little stardust. 
</p><p>
It's all very involved, and not just at the level of production technicalities. You can dispatch private investigators to gather dirt on your whiniest employees, and bribe the mayor to overlook your many, many crimes. You can time and market the release of your movies perfectly after studying your competitor's projects, or simply ask the mafia to "clear the calendar". This is Hollywood's "golden age" in the sense that it's shiny and cold and hard and people will kill for it.
</p>
<p>
Nic might be a dirty, no-good thief, but his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollywood-animal-is-a-nifty-and-detailed-golden-age-simulator-populated-with-eminently-hireable-alcoholics">demo write-up is a lot of fun</a>. "Each film is rated for both 'audience approval' and 'artistic appeal'," he noted. "This may seem like an unnecessarily stringent binary, but remember this was pre-Boss Baby, so no-one knew you could master both yet."
</p>
<p>
The devs are calling it "a box of spiders disguised as a tycoon game". Good job, whoever came up with that line. I wish it was me. If you need further convincing, there's a new demo on the way in December.

            <p>A number of Call Of Duty: Ops 6 quality assurance staff from Eden Prarie, Minnesota have walked out in protest over Activision's ending of hybrid or remote working, which was announced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">December last year</a>. They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">claim</a> that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">Eurogamer</a>, Activision workers group ABetterABK have also <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">issued a statement</a> criticising the "unequal" ROI policy, which has been in effect for nine months. The ABK union say the move has "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accommodations", who have been refused exemption from the policy. </p>
<p>There's also a reference to staff being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing the USA's National Disability Employment Awareness Month, which falls in October. The email in question apparently "depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," according to the ABK statement. As such, it argues that Activision have "been championing [diversity, equity &amp; inclusion] while they continually fail us."</p>
<p>The walkout is small, with about <a href="https://x.com/cwa7250/status/1849961465442136265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 people shown holding CWA signs in photographs</a>, but it's caught the attention of local media like Fox9. </p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> also have a statement from Activision, in which an Acti spokesperson comments that negotiations around individual employee needs are "ongoing", despite the many months since the policy was introduced.</p>
<p>"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," it reads. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum." </p><p>The Activision QA walkout is one of many clashes between developers and management over the end of hybrid and fully remote-working since the lifting of pandemic lockdown measures. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike in protest</a> at a three-day return to the office mandate which the French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) insists was arrived at "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
