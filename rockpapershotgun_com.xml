            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> lives! Well, of course it does, it would be quite shocking if PlayStation were to cancel it before it even got a chance to become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> 2, but that's neither here nor there. What is here, and soon to be there, is another playtest, of which sign-ups are now available. It is being dubbed a "closed technical test," and plans to run for just a few days, between October 22nd and October 28th, but there are a few differences to be found compared to when we last saw it.
</p>
<p>
For starters, this playtest will take place across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, and it'll be available in both North America and Europe this time. Worth noting is that it is under NDA, so you in particular shouldn't go blabbering about it, let some content creator desperate for views do that instead.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what will be available in the test, there'll be three maps to play through and five runner shells to try out. A big change is that the game will now have proximity chat, and notably, a solo queue - in previous playtests you could only play in teams of three, and even if you could launch into a match solo, you'd be at a real disadvantage. On top of that there's "re-tuned combat pacingâ€¦ deeper environmental storytelling, and more." 
</p>
<p>
Whether any of that is enough to make it a good game? Hard to say until someone plays it, but even if this is only a brief overview of what's new, it'll need to feel quite radically different to make an impact. I'm not sure if it sounds like it'll manage that just yet.
</p><p>
Heading to the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post</a> about the network test will take you to a form where you can apply to take part in it, which you can do so until October 16th, or from October 13th you'll be able to do so via Steam directly (sign-ups there will run until October 26th).
</p>
<p>
It's interesting that this playtest is under NDA, given how publicly poor the reception was earlier this year. Certainly sounds like Bungie is continuing an attempt at doing some damage control. The last update we had on the game is that it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinitely delayed</a>, which is still the case, obviously not a good sign for the state of the game. Updates in the following months after the test were promised, so we'll have to wait and see where Marathon ends up landing next year.

            <p>
In the late '90s, early 2000s, there were two distinct flavours of aesthetics: boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, and Y2K girlypop vibes (for the sake of this argument we will ignore every other aesthetic that existed at the time). Boomer shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein were bloody, gory, and had a real "video games are gritty and cool now kind of vibe." Conversely, products aimed at young girls were often glittery, pink, featured leopard print, and were often about love and harmony. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/incolatus-dont-stop-girlypop">Don't Stop, Girlypop!</a> is a game that combines these two vibes, and it is very good (and stressful).
</p>
<p>
Quite specifically, Don't Stop, Girlypop is a self-described "Y2K arena movement shooter where standing still is not an option." You really do have to be constantly on the move, there's even a combo meter that raises higher and higher letting you go faster and subsequently damage more. I had a go at its new demo that just came out today, and let me tell you, I felt like I was having a heart attack, in as positive a way as I can put that.
</p>
<p>
This is a game where calling it maximalist would be an understatement. There's flip phones, you can customise your arms to have funky patterns, you can put little bows on your guns, enemies are constantly coming at you from all angles, and you need to be ready to take them down quickly, because everything moves fast in this world. The thing is, I'm not very good at shooters, so in my experience of its demo, I quickly got overwhelmed. Even still I could find myself learning the ropes as I went along, and I'm sure more experienced shooter aficionados could get to grips with it pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>
Outside of loving its vibe, I'm into the equally over the top story - "Mining corp Tigris Nix wants to drain your world of The Love, a natural force keeping your planet alive. Lay waste to its robot drones to heal the Oasis!" That's all ridiculous! Yet it matches the tone of its look, and has a healthy amount of corporation frustration, always an added bonus in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Don't Stop, Girlypop! doesn't have a release date just yet, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">but you can wishlist it and try out its demo on Steam now</a>.

            <p>I dunno about you, but I usually dig a big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">mod</a> that threatens to make my number of hours spent padding around Tamriel even more ludicrous. Lordbound is the latest danger to the free time of poor folks like me, having just soft launched after ten years of development spent creating a fresh region bigger than the Dragonborn DLC's Solstheim and filling it with stuff to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160493">The mod</a>'s set in the Druadach Valley between Skyrim and Daggerfall's setting of High Rock, and so offers a chance to mix it up with tribal orcs, Imperial legionnaires, and highfalutin Breton lords. Think The Reach, but with a few less plant-hearted warriors and weird bird-ladies. Those three factions form the pillars of "the biggest main quest you've ever played in Skyrim, with choices and consequences that change the state of the valley". Here's a synopsis of the situation you'll walk into:</p>
<blockquote><p>The drums of war are beating inside the Druadach Valley. After two hundred years of isolation the valley has restored its severed connections to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock, exposing its withered remains to the rest of Tamriel. Chief Gorek of Garshakur refuses to surrender his mountain fortress to the Imperial Legion, denying them control of the highly-valued trade route between the cities of Jehanna and Solitude.</p>
<p>As the war wages on, the people of Druadach are forced to seek protection within the walls of Highreach, home of the young Lord Haelan - but even the last bastion of Druadach is threatening to fall at the hands of a mysterious knight of unknown origin, leaving only death in its wake. Whatever the choices are in the end, the fate of the valley rests in the hands of champions both new and old.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice Elder Scrolls lore knot to unpick by shouting at things and also slapping things with your sword. The modders reckon that, plus the 40 or so new quests and 50 or so new dungeons that help flesh out the valley, will keep you occupied for around 60 hours. Damn, that's about 1/8th of the time it usually takes me to sort my Skyrim load order out at any given moment.</p><p>That said, I'm slightly concerned that the mod cites "surprising consumables" alongside its fresh gear. What could be shocking to consume in the estimations of someone who's hung out with Sheogorath for at least five minutes during that one quest? Call dibs on which bodily fluid you reckon below. Anyway, the NPCs are fully voiced, so I'll be able to ask one of them to spill the beans.</p>
<p>Do expect some teething issues if you dive in at this soft launch stage to enquire for yourself. "We're still actively completing features of it, and there will be bugs," Lordbound's devs wrote. "While everything is largely playable, we still have work to do on the voice acting side of things. Additionally, our final checks have of course revealed more issues than anticipated. We scrambled to get the worst offenders fixed, but be fully prepared to encounter bugs through your adventures (not the chaurus kind)."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109">Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice</a> are requirements to get it running.</p>
