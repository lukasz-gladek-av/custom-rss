            <p>Ideal podcast game and source of all my lorry knowledge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2%3EEuro%20Truck%20Simulator">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> is expanding its map to Ireland in the future, devs SCS Software have revealed. The DLC, dubbed Isle of Ireland, will include both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as fresh trucking locales.</p>
<p>It's another entry in the list of add-ons in the works for Euro Truck Sim 2, which also includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-pining-for-the-fjords-with-a-nordic-expansion">Nordic map expansion</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches</a>, and a number of reworks to existing areas. The latter includes a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/project-uk-rework.html">UK revamp</a> announced just the other week, which should ensure that driving from Birmingham to Belfast shouldn't resemble a voyage from 2013 to 5.</p>

<p>"Drivers will be able to tackle narrow routes lined with stone walls and hedgerows, travel on untamed coastal stretches battered by the Atlantic winds, and roll through small villages and towns steeped in charm and tradition," SCS wrote in their Ireland expansion <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/introducing-isle-of-ireland.html">annoucement post</a>. "From the energetic streets of Dublin and Belfast to the peaceful rhythm of the countryside, making a delivery without pausing to admire the view will be a challenge in itself!"</p><p>In terms of landmarks to admire in between cargo hauls, expect the likes of the Rock of Cashel, Ben Bulben, Belfast’s Samson and Goliath cranes, and the Giant’s Causeway. "Haul through farmland, cross windswept landscapes where folklore feels close at hand, and navigate into vibrant city centres where modern life and centuries of history stand side by side," the devs say. "Ferry ports such as Rosslare will also play an important role, opening the way to connections across the Irish Sea and beyond."</p>
<p>As is usually the case with Truck Sim expansions, there's no release date for Isle of Ireland yet. "Everything shown so far is still very much a work in progress" according to SCS. Given the Nordic Horizons expansion sounded like it was being loosely aimed at 2026 in its 2024 reveal, maybe we'll be headed to Ireland in 2027.</p>
<p>Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3851260/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2__Isle_of_Ireland/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and stare wistfully at the screenshots. Maybe scroll from Malin Head to Mizen Head on Google Maps to help limit any ire the wait engenders in you.</p>

            <p>I know it all. All of the witty insights, all of the arcane knowledge, and all of the random blather. I know all of the words. Or at least I will if I decide to use one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>'s early mods, which ditches the skill restrictions to give you access to every dialogue line in the game. It's just one among a nice crop of tweaks thus far, as the Order of Adjustment dig their mitts into the RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-beginners-guide">early access</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Of the 28 or so mods which have popped up over the game's first weekend in the hands of folks who paid extra, it's the latest to arrive that's caught my eye. Veteran modder Kassent has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/31">ditched the skill requirements</a> which lock away certain dialogue lines if, for example, you've not invested enough points into engineering to be able to dish out some accurate yacking about machines.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's not the kind of thing I'd remotely recommend enabling for your first playthrough, since it'll get in the way of you roleplaying anything other than the galaxy's smartiest pants, but as someone who's used these sorts of mods in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> to seek out the elusive last few bits of chatter I might have missed in multiple conventional runs, I'll likely give it a whirl down the line. After all, if a game's got good words, which this one definitely does, it's nice to take 'em all in.</p>
<p>If you're looking for mods that might be useful right out of the box, there's a solid selection of those building up too. As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Bloodlines 2 last week</a>, modder Caites is behind a lot of the early tweaks. Thus far, they've done stuff like aid combat-averse cowards by making The Incognito's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-how-to-get-all-companions">crew of companions</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/9">tougher</a>, make it <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/11">easier to get</a> whichever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-best-perks">perk</a>/flaw loadout you like, and have even found time to give the VATS-esque tactical time dilation mechanic <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/6">a boost</a> I'm not sure it needed. Also in the 'make things easier' bucket are modder Goldenchrome's option of more than the usual two <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/4">skill points per level up</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/24">range boosting</a> of the neon outlines around grabbable or intertactable stuff.</p><p>Finally, if you're a weirdo and decide not to play in the default first-person perspective, here's a mod which pushes the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/theouterworlds2/mods/25">third-person camera a bit closer</a> to your character, potentially making it a bit easier to hit the thing you're shooting at.</p>
<p>Most of these Outer Worlds 2 mods are installed via simple file placement, but it's worth noting that <a href="https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS?tab=MIT-1-ov-file">UE4SS</a> is required to get Kassent's dialogue unlocker working. If you're still on the fence about the game ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date">full launch</a> this week, consider taking a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review</a>.</p>

            <p>In further evidence that the Vampire game series is as cursed as its toothy goreguzzlers, the developers of troubled battle royale offshoot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a> have announced that it’s shutting down for good – mere days after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-delayed (yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">apparently still okay-ish</a>) mainline sequel finally released.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This might not be surprising if you’ve followed Bloodhunt since its own launch in 2022, with low player counts leading to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-battle-royale-is-ending-development-after-last-years-launch">end of active development</a> just a year later. Devs Sharkmob said at the time that its servers will remain online as long as an "active player base and community" continued to exist, but <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026">today’s blog post</a> confirms those servers will beep their last on April 28th 2026. I guess that’s still a decent chunk of time to get any last Winner Winner Human Dinners in, though the announcement timing is curious – is the Bloodlines 2 timing a coincidence, or were Sharkmob hoping for a bump in interest-by-association that never materialised?</p>
<p>Either way, and as the post states, "the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable." Bloodhunt has also been taken off sale immediately, and existing players can no longer buy tokens – Bloodhunt’s in-game currency – through its shop. Any tokens left in your leather trenchcoat’s tattered pockets will still be good for virtual purchases until the server shutdown, mind.</p>
<p>We never reviewed Bloodhunt, and Alice B’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-preview">2021 preview</a> was based on too embryonic a build to judge the multiplayer experiment’s chances. I do remember playing a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-system-requirements-pc-performance-and-the-best-settings-to-use">for hardware reasons</a>, but wasn’t terribly compelled: the inclusion of the 'masquerade' dynamic, wherein you’re encouraged to hide your vampiric powers and/or murders from the eyes of an ignorant public, might have made for a better battle royale twist if the game’s rendition of Prague wasn’t so empty. Which, unlike the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-provide-workarounds-for-high-priority-bugs-including-seattles-populace-disappearing">accidental abandonment of Bloodline 2's Seattle</a>, wasn’t the result of bugs. And I know I bring up this god damned game every time I write about BRs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> was already doing highly agile last-man-standery at much higher technical and presentational calibres.</p><p>Thus, Bloodhunt’s slow undeath is finally set for an end. At least Bloodlines 2 seems to be doing, again, okay-ish, peaking at a respectable #3 in the Steam Top Sellers charts last week and already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">siring an active modding community</a>.</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! Good news, James has returned from India and appears none the worse for his voyages. I was hoping he'd come back with a top-to-bottom report on Indian game development, but no, it turns out the smirking jackanapes was merely "on holiday". Still, we welcome him back with open arms and in the Maw's case, orifices, because it's another stuffed week for PC game releases. Here are a few that seem noteworthy.

<h2>Tuesday 28th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/">Death By Scrolling</a> is not another word for owning a smartphone, but an endlessly upwardly mobile RPG from a team led by auld LucasArts fellah Ron Gilbert, creator of the Maniac Monkey and Mansion Island games.</li>

</ul>
<p>What are we of the Treehouse doing this week? Well, the electricians turned my power off during the morning Slack meeting, so I'm not quite sure, but I think James is departing again shortly - this time, he's off on an actual press trip. Mark spent a lot of the meeting talking about how much Hong Kong dollars are worth - make of that what you will.</p><p>Ollie is about to cap his magnum opus, our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> guides hub, and Jeremy is making in-roads on The Outer Worlds 2, while Callum is off to the races (Umamusume: Pretty Derby). I've got Arc on the brain and possibly roguelites and Total War as well. What are you up to, other than scornfully telling me about any games we've missed from the round-up?</p>

            <p>Almost half of the 1,448,270 signatures amassed by the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Destroying Videogames</a> EU citizens' initiative have now been verified, according to the campaigners' latest update. Meanwhile, the group are working to "secure expert backing" which doesn't rely on "expensive consulting firms" for their effort to push EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," reads this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">latest update post</a> from organiser Moritz Katzner. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France—but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." Getting over the signature verification hurdle was something the campaigners had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">expressed concerns about previously</a>. There were fears that removing the fakes would result in the initiative falling short of the numbers needed to push for government action. Those worries were somewhat abated last month, with the group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-fakery-concerns-stop-destroying-videogames-campaign-claim-around-97-of-their-signatures-are-valid-so-far">citing positive "early reports"</a> regarding the validity of their signature totals.</p>
<p>In his post, Katzner went on to claim that the European Commission's <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/commission-launches-open-consultation-forthcoming-digital-fairness-act">Digital Fairness Act</a> received a "record-breaking number of submissions" during its feedback phase. That act, which is the brainchild of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, has been <a href="https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/">in the works since last September</a> and will aim to protect consumers against the likes of "deceptive or manipulative interface design, misleading marketing by social media influencers, addictive design of digital products and unfair personalisation practices, especially where consumer vulnerabilities are exploited for commercial purposes".</p>
<p>As for what the campaigners are currently up to, Katzner wrote that along with taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">meetings with politicians and governments</a>, they're "actively working to secure expert backing" for their initiative from developers in the industry. "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions - without relying on expensive consulting firms," the organiser explained.</p><p>"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," he added. "It’s against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage. That’s why we said 'enough' - and why so many of you did too. Let’s not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can’t undo past damage, but we can stop what’s coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."</p>
<p>We'll see just how much support from within the games industry the Stop Destroying Videogames lot can get on board, while they wait for the rest of their initiative's signatures to be checked. Then, it'll be up to politicians and bodies to debate whether and how any action is taken in response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">this and similar campaigns across the globe</a>.</p>

            <p>Screenshots for Bluepoint's cancelled live service God Of War game appear to have slipped through the titan fingers of publishers Sony. Assuming they aren't a dream woven by Morpheus (via his earthly emissaries at <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled">MP1st</a>), they reveal a few work-in-progress environments from the abandoned project, which Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">reportedly cancelled earlier this year</a> alongside a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> devs Sony Bend.</p><!--more-->
<p>As you might expect, the screens are heavy on Ancient Greek architecture. Although perhaps you weren't expecting that, given that the last couple of Gowwers took place in settings from Nordic myth, with occasional, mostly unwelcome cameos from Kratos's old chums south of the Alps. MP1st's source for the screenshots claims that the game would have featured Hades, god of the underworld, playing the part of armory master. This suggests it would have taken place prior to God Of War 3. The cavern roofs and yellow sulphur pools in the snaps certainly look rather Stygian. There are also interiors with broken bridges and balconies that imply a touch of platforming. </p>



<p>The things that spring out to me the most from those screens are the pots. Such glorious pots! Pots of lime green and charcoal black and deepest terracotta, flaking away to bare pink clay. Pots with rolling, woven patterns and cute little handles and cracks that bespeak a lifetime of humble service. How I yearn to hit them with an axe and see how they fall apart. How I yearn to charge through them like piles of leaves. Quality pot smashing is six tenths of the thrill of action-RPGs, even when they aren't game-as-a-service projects in which hidden, semi-random loot is the focus. It doesn't matter how many HBO-courting father-son storylines you pack in if the urns don't break real good.</p><p>I'd say these pots are fit to be published, but uncle Sony had other ideas. They've spent much of the past few years splurging on live service games, and are now cutting back on that investment in the wake of the ill-fated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> (which they threw in the bin mere weeks after launch). Bluepoint appear to be keeping busy in the wake of the reported God Of War cancellation. Earlier this month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-job-listing-at-bluepoint-games-fuels-speculation-over-its-next-project-but-is-bloodborne-really-likely">discovered</a> that they were advertising for a senior combat designer with a "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>
