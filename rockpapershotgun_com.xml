            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lightyear-frontier">Lightyear Frontier</a> launched into early access a little over a year ago, and it generally seems to have trudged along reasonably well since then. It's not quite ready for 1.0 just yet, but a new update was announced by developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/frame-break">Frame Break</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/amplifier-studios">Amplifier Studios</a> earlier this week that sounds like it'll be bringing in some much needed changes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Appropriately titled the Shifting Gears Update, there's two big things it's changing. For one, the world itself is about to get a lot bigger. The devs explained that while a lot of people liked the "lush nature of the game world," it was also just a bit too small. So, the map is increasing in size for "large-scale farming", with the main progression system receiving a rework for "higher emphasis on farming." 
</p>
<p>
Hazards like tornadoes have been added in too to make getting around this bigger world a bit more challenging (but you can also just turn that off if you're just in it to relax).
</p>
<p>
Plus, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512957645996427407">as previously mentioned by the devs</a>, the narrative is getting reworked, namely mostly cutting out the character PIP-3R as a constant voice in your ear. Jay Castello called this one quite accurately in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-early-access-review">early access review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
The narrative isn't going away completely, and PIP-3R may appear again further down the line. But for now the way you'll learn about the story is through Inspection Points, which are just bits of flavour text that appear in certain areas, and Artifacts Findings, which are also just bits of flavour text from artifacts you find.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's a lot more features coming like a new mod chip system to upgrade your mech, automated drone watering, and a lot more. You can check out the full list of additions over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512958914879291494?l=english">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Shifting Gears update isn't too far away either, as it's currently due out June 4th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I wasn't expecting it personally, but it seems like the new hotness is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, 'ey? Sure, it's from a studio like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/level5">Level-5</a>, who've made massive games from Yo-kai Watch to Professor Layton. I just didn't expect a sequel to a 3DS game from over a decade ago to do so well. In fact, it appears Level-5 is so happy with how much money everyone's given them, it'll be giving away a free bit of DLC for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> at some point in the future.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The DLC is called "<a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">Update the World!</a>" which is a wonderful little title, and a sentence I'd expect from some anime villain obsessed with tech who wants to install a new operating system on Earth, or something. In terms of what it'll include, there'll be "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources." 
</p>
<p>
Maybe that'll mean more quests, or side activities, I'm not entirely sure, it's pretty vague. Though perhaps not as vague as the fact that there'll be "new recipes added" in the DLC too. Yummy, I love recipes! Level-5 also promised that they will "continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time."
</p>
<p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this bit of DLC, kind of seems like a "we sold lots of copies so we can announce this but we're not quite ready for it yet" type of announcement. Either way, there's already lots to be getting on with given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alternate-between-14-lives-in-level-5s-latest-open-world-fantasy-rpg-out-on-pc-this-week">you've got 14 lives to choose from</a>, an existentially terrifying point that I won't spend too much time on.
