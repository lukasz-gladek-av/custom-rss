            <p>
You know what I might have most about games? There's no universal way to play them. You buy a DVD, you buy a DVD player, and aside from maybe a region lock issue you're as good as gold. If I buy Snowboard Kids for the N64, and I don't have one of those, well, I'm up a particular creek. That has meant that many a game over the years has been stuck to particular platforms, one of the most surprising being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio-future">Jet Set Radio Future</a>, to this day a game that's still only available on the original Xbox, and the Xbox 360 through backwards compatibility. But! Thanks to some techy wizards, that might change in the near future.
</p>
<p>
That's because of a decompilation project that is currently underway for the North American release of the game. Now, I'm a far cry from those tech wizards I mentioned, but as far as I understand it, decompiling a game is a process where a game is taken apart so that it can be rebuilt. This allows for things like native PC ports of games that maybe never had any, which, in this case for Jet Set Radio Future, is something that could one day be an option.
</p>

<p>
Right now, according to the project's <a href="https://codeberg.org/KeybadeBlox/JSRF-Decompilation">Codeberg page</a>, the decompilation process itself is about 30% done, but these kinds of projects normally take quite a while, so don't expect it to be finished any time soon. And again, decompiling doesn't mean that a PC port will be ready to go right out the gate either.
</p><p>
Still, it would be nice to free this one from defunct platform prison. There are obviously excellent spiritual successors like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a>, yet sometimes going straight to the source is what you need. It's also just a unique way to preserve a game, even if not the intended way to experience it.

            <p>
We've all been there. You're at the end of a game, you've done all of the side quests, you're strong as hell, finally read to take on the final boss, confident you can finish this quest you started 30-100 hours ago. Only to find that the fight is a piece of piss because, whoops! You overlevelled yourself by too much. This was seemingly the case for a number of people in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and now the game's lead designer Michel Nohra has expressed some regret for those who had that experience.
</p>
<p>
"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra told Edge in a recent interview (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">GamesRadar</a>). "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."
</p>
<p>
Part of this comes down to, in the opinion of lead programmer Tom Guillermin, being led by "humility," simply because they weren't sure if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was any good. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon. We're happy about that, but we didn't see it coming."
</p>
<p>
To be honest, to me it just sounds like Clair Obscur followed in a long lineage of games that let you overlevel before the endgame. And as a chronic side quest skipper, if I ever get around to this one, I'm sure the final boss will be enough of a challenge.

            <p>
Ubisoft are closing Ubisoft Halifax, the Canadian developers of mobile games Rainbow Six Mobile and Assassin's Creed Rebellion. This is strictly speaking outside our mandate as a PC gaming site, of course - I fear smartphones like Hell itself, and only ever communicate over long distances using homing pigeons - but it's all part of Ubisoft's wider transformation into a heavily Tencent-backed publisher, and the nasty twist is that Ubisoft Halifax had only just voted to unionise.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Ubisoft Halifax staff announced the founding of Ubisoft's first labour union in North America earlier this week, having begun the process in June 2025. Almost 74% of the studio's staff voted in favour, spanning the programming, production, design, art and R&amp;D departments. The vote was actually due to take place last June, but Ubisoft mounted challenges that were ultimately dropped ahead of vote-counting in December.
</p>
<p>
In announcement materials, the freshly unionised Halifax staff appeared positive about their relationship with the company. "We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered," they wrote. "We are unionising not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation."
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft have binned them off, though they've stressed to GI that this has nothing to do with unionisation. "Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," the company said in a statement. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance." 
</p><p>
According to an Ubisoft spokesperson, the closure forms part of cost-cutting that dates back to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the end of the pandemic revenue boom. They remain happy to recognise and work with unionised staff in general. It should of course be noted that there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">plenty of unionised Ubisoft staff in other regions</a>, but still, I'm not sure burning down a subsidiary within weeks of a union vote indicates strong desire for a healthy dialogue with the workers.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Halifax weren't always a mobile-dedicated studio. Prior to their acquisition by the House of Guillemot in 2015, they were known as Longtail and worked on guitar game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocksmith">Rocksmith</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following a rough couple of years defined by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">plummeting stock prices and shareholder uprisings</a>, Ubisoft are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded core "creative house"</a>, shoring up their core <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six operations while trimming the books elsewhere. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced plans for redundancies</a> at Massive, creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, together with a change of direction for Trials devs Redlynx.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Ubisoft Halifax staff now looking for new jobs.
