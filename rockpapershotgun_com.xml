            <p>It's the Game Awards this evening, which means another year of Josef Fares appearing on stage to performatively say "fuck" like he thinks it's naughty. Thankfully this year he also had a game to show: Split Fiction, a new co-op action adventure. It's about two aspiring authors, one who writes science fiction and one who writes fantasy, being sucked into and having to survive inside their own fictions.

<p>Split Fiction takes place in a near-future where a tech company is able to turn people's stories into virtual worlds. Insert your commentary about generative AI here. In this instance, protagonists Mio and Zoe are shoved into their own stories, but they're strangers, and they have to survive in those dangerous, collapsing worlds as they get to know one another. 
</p>
<p>Levels seemingly alternate back and forth between sci-fi, with robots and explosions and cybercops, and a trad fantasy world of dragons. Both worlds seem... a bit cliché? But perhaps that's intentional given that these worlds are, in the fiction, created by newbie writers. Perhaps they will grow and learn and become better at worldbuilding by the end of the game.
</p><p>Yes, I'm giving it too much credit. Split Fiction is from Hazelight, the developers of other co-op games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>. I played It Takes Two and it's pretty good, because it constantly shifts setting and mechanics in a way that keeps it fresh and surprising. It's not particularly narratively coherent, however, and there's often very little connection between the plot or emotional beats and the mecha-insect you're piloting while murdering wasps for some reason.
</p>
<p>In any case, I'm looking forward to Split Fiction. It's already got a release date, too: March 6th, 2025.

            <p>The Geoffies have delivered us a first look at the gameplay for Obsidian’s spacefaring RPG sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. It looks, as you might expect, very much like the first one, but a bit nicer. The game itself was announced back in 2021, but we’ve seen nary a vaguely satirical sign nor very large gun since. Now we have both, plus some punching. Here’s that trailer. </p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2, which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">Steam here</a>, is due out sometime next year. You’ll be exploring a new frontier named The Arcadia colony. It’s “engulfed in a factional war” which is probably bad news for the residents, but undoubtedly good news for people who like to pick a side to do quests for.</p>
<p>Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart spoke about the game’s progress <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-boss-but-they-did-consider-throwing-the-whole-team-on-avowed">back in August</a>, which they’ve been developing simultaneously with fantasy RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. "It's going really well," Urquhart said. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> turned out awesome. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a> turned out awesome. Avowed is going to be great. Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. And then we have a base now, of everything we've now done with Avowed and Outer Worlds 2, with how we use Unreal Engine and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years, to go off and make the whole next generation of games."</p>
<p>Here’s Alice Bell’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-pc-review">review of the first game</a>. “<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> is alright, innit. It's good fun. Sit back and let the orange and neon wash over you. Boo the cartoonishly evil corporations,” she wrote. “But you can tell it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks. Real space cowboys take risks, don't they?”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> launched on console back in February, and if I'd had to guess, I'd say it would arrive on PC about a year later. Hey - guess what! Square Enix just gave Rebirth a PC release date: January 23rd, 2025.

<p>The PC release will have improved lighting, enhanced textures and models, and support for DLSS and other graphics features. You can see it in action in the brief trailer below:

<p>Rebirth continues where Remake left off, by rendering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>'s post-Midgar areas in all the high-res glory modern machines can muster. We haven't done a proper review of it obviously, because it hasn't been out on PC, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ff7-rebirths-open-world-is-both-one-step-forward-and-one-step-back-over-ff15">Katharine did enjoy it when she played it on console</a> (supporters only), even as she had some issues with its open world design:
</p>
<blockquote>That's not to say Rebirth isn't as spectacular or jaw-droppingly pretty and awe-inspiring as other open worlds. But the way it adheres to the Chadley tick-box regime does, I think, rob it of some of its potential wonder. Once you've done all those tasks, there's very little else to discover in them, leaving them feeling a little empty and lacking in mystery. For all Final Fantasy 15's faults, of which there are many, I did always feel a sense of curious excitement whenever I turned another bend on one of its many great highways, and the idle chatter of my lads in the back of the car gave the world a little more flavour and a little more personality as a result. Your Rebirth crew might be better chocobo riders than Noctis and his boyband, but they sure are a weirdly silent bunch as you bounce between mission objectives.</blockquote>
<p>We'll have a full review in the new year, around its release on January 23rd.

<p>Revealed at the Game Awards just now, The Witcher 4 video is both a showcase for the engine technology, “pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU”, and a demonstration of the kind of quest you might encounter in the game, which looks to follow squarely in The Witcher 3’s bootprints.</p>
<p>We see Ciri take on a contract to save a girl from being sacrificed to a spidery forest creature. “Aiming to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms,” comments <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards">a press release on the official site</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows off a few of Ciri’s tools, including Witcher spells and a chain-hook weapon you’ll seemingly use to stop monsters darting about, readying them for your silver sword.</p>
<p>Ciri won’t just be the star of this game: she’ll helm the next few Witcher games, according to game director Sebastian Kalemba.</p>
<p>“We're kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” he said in the press release. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher IV; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.” </p>
<p>For clarity, The Witcher 4 is the project previously codenamed Polaris. CD Projekt have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-are-making-a-new-witcher-trilogy-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-and-a-brand-new-ip">plenty other irons in the fire</a>. What do you make of it all?</p>
