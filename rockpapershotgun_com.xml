<p>I’m sorry to announce that I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/notes-from-the-tribes-3-rivals-playtest-its-fun-but-is-it-tribes">yet</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ten-pc-games-i-could-have-played-in-full-during-the-time-i-spent-failing-to-connect-to-elden-ring-nightreign-on-ps5">again</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/titanfall-and-tribes-fans-dont-miss-skyfaring-shooter-echo-point-nova">going</a> to speak highly of a game about going up and down hills, real quickly like. Haste: Broken Worlds, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clustertruck">Clustertruck</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/totally-accurate-battlegrounds">Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</a> devs Landfall, is very much about the haste first and the broken worlds second, sending you hurtling across the inclines of its cartoon gauntlets at what Chris Morris would call <a href="https://youtu.be/D-RS_yEI7IM?si=7nerZEEVhVirx0_O&amp;t=31">terrifying legspeeds</a>.</p>

<p>As per Tribes/Tiny Wings convention, Haste is a game of momentum, where you’ll need to build up speed on downwards slopes before launching yourself off the rises. Spend too long off the ground, though, and all that meddlesome air friction will slow you right down, thus encouraging a satisfyingly rapid-yet-graceful series of up-down manoeuvres. Like a dolphin, who’s really good at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>.</p>
<p>While you don’t do much <em>except</em> run forwards in Haste, it is keen to put up more of a challenge than just finding the perfect racing line. Randomised obstacles range from simple trees and spiked vines to giant lasers, rising lava pools that obscure all but a precious few slopes, and eventually, the rocket barrages of a hefty robot you defeat by faceplanting into at 120kph. </p>
<p>Dodging all these while keeping your pace up does engage a sufficiently diverse selection of brain parts to feel worthwhile and satisfying, and fatigue is rarely an issue as each level takes less than a minute to clear. In between, you can select your next dash from a branching map, with occasional stops to refill your health or buy sprint-assisting gadgets using collected crystals.</p>

<p>Hang on a tic. Branching paths? Run-specific upgrades? Why, this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> in unusually aerodynamic parachute pants, which I guess also means we’re Wishlisting a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> for about the fiftieth time this week. Sorry for that as well. Except, again, Haste doesn’t really care about making you repeat yourself into finally achieving one ultimate, golden run. Upgrades are nice and all, but deep down it’s still a test of speed, not builds – and with some effective application of the 'glide downwards' key, there’s an awful lot of speed to be had.</p>
<p>At its best, Haste is thrillingly kinetic, repeatedly spiking you with the rush of near-missing deathtraps at Mach 1. Even the soundtrack eggs you on, its pounding electronica slowing down as you do; biff a landing or misjudge an obstacle and it starts to sound almost panicked in its haggardness, as if the music itself is begging you to spin back up the giant hamster wheel that powers its continued existence.</p>
<p>Not everything is conducive to that delicious sense of forward velocity. One of the special stages merely has you painting the colour back into a monochrome island by running around it in circles, an incongruous non-challenge given the exceedingly generous time limit. As a longtime connoisseur of go-fast hill sliding games, however, I can say that for the most part, Haste: Broken Worlds is exactly my speed. You can see if it’s yours as well with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796470/HASTE_Broken_Worlds/">Steam demo</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some things I have smashed through in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/">the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a>: fire hydrants, surf boards, barns, an entire laundromat, street lamps, palm trees, garbage cans, several pedestrians, mailboxes, food stalls, fish markets, brick walls, a lookout tower, dumpsters, housewives, the city fountain, and a row of unsuspecting sunbathers. This toy-like messabout is proof of one thing. Almost every problem can be solved by driving a 1950s truck straight through it. </p>

<p>Deliver At All Costs was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deeply-destructive-driving-game-deliver-at-all-costs-will-see-you-smashing-1950s-america-to-pieces">in September last year</a>, a delivery game that's part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>. You play as underemployed courier boy Winston, who is running odd jobs for a delivery company with some eccentric management. The trailer showed enough wanton environmental destruction that the heinous sandcastle kicker inside me was intrigued. Now it has a demo out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>, and I can confirm: it feels good to smash.</p>

<p>That's in large part thanks to the driving. An isometric-ish perspective can work a certain magic on a driving game, I've often found. It makes vehicles feel toy-like, as if you're a nipper racing your Hot Wheels around from on-high. That's the case here. It helps that the car movement itself is smooth and satisfying. You drift in gratifying curves, your speed is never so fast you can't keep an eye on what's coming, and a certain amount of helpful braking is automatically applied just in the act of turning. </p>
<p>There's a little bit of story leading you through your time on the island of St Monique - a fictional tropical territory of the United States in the 1950s. The first mission will see you delivering a case of exploding fireworks across the island, dodging the explosions that threaten to pop your wheels if you hit a runaway firecracker. But it's fine. You can get out and repair your wheels with tools easily enough.</p>
<p>That and the forgiving respawn gives me the feeling this tire smoker is more interested in the gags it can create through reckless deliverymanship than in actually throwing big challenges your way. But the next mission is at least a little trickier. You've got to drive 60 stinking watermelons to an insecticide plant without too many flying overboard when you rush over potholes or take a corner too fast.</p>

<p>I spent a big chunk of the demo ignoring the story mode entirely, choosing instead to drive around and explore the five zones of the island already open in the demo. I smashed through greenhouses along the tropical coast of one region and blazed through the trainyards, factories, and sheds of another more industrial district. There are also side missions you can pick up by chatting to civilians (the mayor wants me to find his body double because he can't be arsed going to budget meetings himself).</p>
<p>As for how GTA-like it gets, well, it doesn't have the same hunger for raw violence. You can run over pedestrians but they bounce harmlessly around as immortal ragdolls. Although, they will get furious and chase you down with baseball bats, and will shove you onto the ground if you step  outside the car to face them. You can't hijack any car driving around the streets, but any parked car is fair game. I could've also hopped into a phone booth and used it to recall the company truck, but by this stage it was more chaotic just to source my next fencewrecker from the streets.</p>
<p>I very much admire when a game smashes the right "gamefeel" for its theme, and going by the demo Deliver At All Costs has some of that slip-slidey <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> goodness. The full game doesn't have a release date yet. But we'll let you know when it's out for delivery.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
