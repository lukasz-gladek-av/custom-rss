            <p>Better get yer cigar chompin' mouth muscles warmed up. Second world war sabotage 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a> now has a release date, and it's fairly soon. Good news for people who enjoy sniping fascists from across the map while commanding a barrel-armed Irishmen to simultaneously slit a throat. And equally good news for those who lament the loss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun">Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun</a> developer Mimimi Games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This reboot is coming out on April 9th, said developers Claymore Game Studios in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1479730/view/501690406746980951">a Steam post</a>. "After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development, and the invaluable community feedback from various playtests - operation ‘Release’ is a go," said studio director Jürgen Reusswig.</p>
<p>But maybe you don't have all the requisite wrinkles to remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-behind-enemy-lines">Commandos</a>? They were a series of tough top-down tactics games that saw the player infiltrate axis territory during World War 2. They looked like real-time strategy games but were really all about high-stakes stealth. That, and trying to find the one good angle your sniper could actually shoot from.</p>
<p>This follow-up will have 10 missions in wartime locales like the North African desert and snowy Scandinavia, and you'll be able to slink through Nazi encampments slashing necks with a pal in two-player co-op (both online or split-screen). Nic played a demo during last autumn's Next Feast, and walked away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-origins-looks-like-a-solid-and-satisfying-return-for-the-legendary-tactics-series">feeling broadly positive</a> about all the meticulously timed soldier strangling. He also dropped a wardrobe on the heads of two unsuspecting Nazis. What's not to like?</p><p>Publisher Kalypso Media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-acquired-by-kalypso-media">bagged the rights to the Commandos</a> games back in 2018 and promptly got to work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kalypso-have-set-up-a-new-commandos-game-studio">setting up a studio</a> to revive the series. The resultant reboot will be flying the flag for the stealth tactics genre after the demise of Mimimi Games, who basically revived and modernised all the ideas of old-school Commandos games when they made Shadow Tactics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>. These were all well-liked games by folks here at RPS. Sadly, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">closed down in the summer of 2023</a>, with the founders of the studio citing exhaustion as the main reason they were downing tools.  </p>
<p>"We cherished every game we made and feel proud of what we were able to accomplish as a studio," they said when announcing the closure. "At the same time, dedicating the past decade and a half of our lives working on increasingly ambitious games took a heavy personal toll on us and our families."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Claymore learn from Mimimi's work, and what ideas of their own they'll inject (or re-inject?) into the genre. Although Edwin has just soldier-crawled into the room wearing two stripes of boot polish on his face to pass on some intelligence. He says monastery stealth game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monastery-escape-tactics-sim-the-stone-of-madness-is-out-now-and-has-me-thinking-about-time">The Stone Of Madness</a> from the Balsphemous developers is also keeping the genre alive. This is a promising sign. Dismissed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The RPS review of Firaxis' grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilisation 7</a> is currently <em>in progress</em>. We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">awarding it two out of a possible five beetles</a>. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">statement last Friday</a> following feedback from the game's advanced access period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In response to your feedback, we’ve identified three key areas that we’re prioritizing work against as quickly as possible," say Firaxis. They're planning to share a roadmap "soon", but this is what they're working on for now. Chief among the three areas is a focus on improving the UI - their "top priority", they say. They're working on "making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more". Do love a good "more". Could be anything! Exciting!</p>
<p>As for multiplayer, they're working on the following:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, they're aiming to roll out a quality o' life patch in March, featuring "quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes".</p>
<p>In other Civ news, Firaxis announced <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmHvLykP-HI">Civ 7 VR yesterday</a>, exclusive to ZuckQuest 3 and 3s. I will never stand to play a strategy game and you cannot make me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Would you like the good or the bad news first? Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> demake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-psx">Bloodborne PSX</a> is no more. As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607803/sony-copyright-claim-bloodborne-psx">The Verge</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607803/sony-copyright-claim-bloodborne-psx">PC Gamer</a>), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/">Itch</a> for three years without issue.</p>
<p>This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> mod, which had been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v">available without issue since 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/b0tster.yeag.gay/post/3lhjt5ufa722a">an animated recap</a> of events by Walther herself.</p>
<p>These events seem doubly abrupt and misguided in light of the fact that Sony previously gave Walther their blessing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-kart-will-scrub-the-branding-off-after-being-contacted-by-sonys-lawyers">release Nightmare Kart following a few changes</a>, notably the title from '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>'. Could MarkScan perhaps be acting a touch overzealously here? From The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>MarkScan has previously made headlines for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/markscan-takedown/">taking down World Cup sites that weren’t even streaming the World Cup</a>, and asking Google to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-flags-its-own-website-for-repeat-copyright-infringements-220724/">remove <em>some of Sony’s own websites</em> on Sony’s behalf</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is generally the case whenever they see a.) a cathedral in real life b.) a British person looking a bit under the weather or c.) a normal rat, some fans have broken out the Bloodbornium and declared these events undeniable portents that it is, once again, huffin' season. A brief mention of Bloodborne in Sony's recent <a href="https://youtu.be/KkmonzpHVRg">30th anniversary video</a> helped stoke these fires.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
