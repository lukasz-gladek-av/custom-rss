If you are fond of snake ladies, sea snakes and staffs that look like snakes, you'll likely be hypnotised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Tides of Torment DLC, which adds three Legendary Lords representing the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly and Sega have just slapped a release date atop this serpentine assembly - 4th December. (PSA: Do not slap anything on real-life serpentine assemblies, unless you are a trained zoologist.) On that very same day, they're hosting a 25th anniversary showcase "unveiling what's next for the franchise".

Expect "new fantasy and historical project announcements, alongside commentary from the development teams shaping the future of Total War." Hopefully, one of the announcements will be that they've finally fixed Twarhammer 3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-developers-are-fighting-to-fix-a-catastrophic-failure-in-many-of-our-ai-systems">currently rather broken AI</a>. No point adding snake ladies if they space out whenever they have to recruit people.
</p><p>
While Tides of Torment will demand a few of your moneybucks, the pack will land alongside some free tweakage and a new campaign for noted demon sexpest Slaanesh. The latter introduces a pirouetting Legendary Lord who once danced at Slaanesh in a sort of sarcastic way, and was accordingly cursed to jig and caper for all eternity. I wasn't aware it was possible to dance sarcastically. I wish I'd known this as a teen.
</p>
<p>
"Coming free as part of Patch 7.0 is the Masque of Slaanesh Legendary Lord, providing a brand-new campaign experience for the excess-driven forces of Slaanesh," Sega explain in <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/mark-your-calendars-for-december-4th-new-total-war-warhammer-content-arrives-alongside-the-25th-anniversary-showcase">their press release</a>. "Alongside her arrival, the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca will receive new legacy updates, allowing players to return to past campaigns and experience a host of new gameplay improvements."
</p>
<p>
Total War turning 25! It feels like only yesterday that I was defending Mikawa province against three factions simultaneously in the original Total War: Shogun. I'm not sure Twarhammer 3 players are in the mood for celebrating - the hitherto-popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s Steam user rating is still Mixed to Mostly Negative, as reviewers rage about everything from DLC pricing through the AI problems to Creative Assembly's communication. Still, perhaps we can fit in a hymn to the glory days alongside some criticism of the missteps.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a>'s offline mode is now live, ensuring that the racer "remains accessible for years to come". Well, assuming you're not bothered about playing online, which would still be deep-sixed if Ubisoft opted to shut down the game's servers, as they did with its predecessor. Odds are that won't happen at least in the immediate future, due to the player feedback the publishers have credited as the impetus behind this addition.</p>
<p>That acknowledgement very much looks to be a way of nodding to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>, who rose to prominence following Ubisoft's shutdown of  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">the first Crew's servers</a> - thereby rendering it totally unplayable - without naming them directly.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR">offline mode</a>, dubbed hybrid mode because cars, has taken a year to leave the garage following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">announcement</a>. Jumping into The Crew 2 now sees you offered a choice as to whether you want to play online or offline, with the latter not boasting the mandatory internet connection which led <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>'s shutdown to play out how it did.</p><p>As you might expect, playing offline's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">rather stripped-back experience</a>, with the likes of the race creator, livery editor and custom liveries, leaderboards, ghosts, and the stats menu being sliced away in addition to the more obvious online bits. Any vehicle packs, season pass stuff, or Ubisoft Connect rewards you've bought or unlocked have to be claimed in a house or HQ in online mode before you can use them offline.</p>
<p>The online and offline modes have separate save systems, allowing you to carry online progress into offline play by exporting your online save to offline mode, but not letting you bring any progress you make while playing offline in the opposite direction. There's also a bit of reading to do in terms of how the switching between the two handles your in-game cash.</p>
<p>"When you choose Export to Offline Save, your current Crew Credits balance is included in the offline save file," Ubisoft wrote. "That offline balance can be used to purchase eligible items while playing in Offline Mode, for example, vehicles available in the offline catalogue. However, some items that are only purchasable via the online Crew Credits storefront (notably vanity items and some bundles) are not available in Offline Mode. If you purchase additional Crew Credits while online after exporting, you must re-export your Online Save to update your Offline Save and include the newly purchased credits."</p>
<p>An offline mode for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>'s also in the works, but no updates have been offered as to when that'll arrive. Even if I doubt Ubisoft'd have done this without the Stop Killing Games campaign having put the series under a microscope, kudos to them for following through on promises to ensure the racers wouldn't be at risk of perma-shutdown in the future.</p><p>While it's been cool to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-resurrected-the-crew-devs-behind-fan-revival-project-are-now-working-on-a-big-mod-to-restore-the-racer-to-greatness">The Crew Unlimited's modders resurrect the original Crew</a> with their server emulator, the onus to keep games people have paid for playable in the long run shouldn't solely be on the substantial efforts of dedicated volunteers.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> will soon receive updates that let you earn more XP per shootbrawl, rank up faster, and unlock gadgets and weapons attachments sooner. The tweaks are coming in response to frustrations about sluggish progression that have seen players pack the game's community servers with XP-farming matches against bots.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression," the developers cry out to us <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">from the corpse-strewn deserts of social media</a>, "especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets, and weapon attachments. We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield." 
</p><p>
So what changes are they making? Firstly, they're bumping up XP from match completion and daily login bonuses by 10% and 40% respectively. Secondly, they're reducing the XP required to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks, meaning you can "start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast". Be warned that if you're already making headway with a particular weapon's unlocks after the update goes live, you might see some weirdness on the UI, "but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon". 
</p>
<p>In other news, assignments (multiplayer challenges to earn cosmetics and such) that once required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively. The devs are aware that this doesn't address wider misgivings about assignments, without going into details - they're "actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes."
</p><p>It's all in the name of making Battlefield 6's online arsenal-growing feel "smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone". It's also in the name of stemming the flood of bot factories in the community servers section.
</p>
<p>"Over the past week, many of you noticed that we reached maximum capacity on community servers," the devs go on. "After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. 
</p>
<p>"We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it's led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it's become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people."
</p>
<p>Battlefield's Community Experiences, EA rather primly point out, are "meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates". They're not supposed to be Operation Firestorm-sized treadmills. There's an overfamiliar op ed to write here about how live service operations of Battlefield's stature routinely grind away their own sense of play. I will spare you that. Instead I'll say that some of my most relaxing experiences during the Battlefield 6 review write-up were bot matches. It's so cute how they play-act at flanking and taking cover.
</p><p>Aside from greasing the progression chute, EA are "developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences." Once they've carried out the associated backend maintenance, they expect that "all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server". 
</p>
<p>Look out for these updates "within the next week, potentially sooner depending on testing and verification". The devs close by acknowledging other complaints about "visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more". They'll be patching those issues down the road, having already wrestled the hydra of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">bouncy ladders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">overclocked sniper rifles</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like the new field-battler is a hit, clogged-up levelling system notwithstanding. Yesterday, EA announced that it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">the best-selling Battlefield so far</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté's departure from Ubisoft after 20 years in various roles was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">announced earlier this week</a>, and the developer's now put out a post in which he says that leaving wasn't his choice. Instead, Côté asserts that it came after he was asked to step aside as Assassin's Creed boss by Ubisoft as part of a corporate restructure, then offered a reduced role as part of the company's Tencent-backed Vantage Studios subsidiary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/">post on LinkedIn</a>. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice."</p>
<p>He continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years. I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</blockquote>
<p>Côté's departure came as a bit of a shock, given it followed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/assassins-creed-shadows-success-shows-that-the-threat-of-negative-campaigns-is-overblown-opinion">success earlier this year</a>, an important win for what's been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">struggling publisher</a> over the past few years. This restructure around the formation of Vantage Studios, a subsidiary created to oversee Assassin's Creed, FarCry and Rainbow Six going forwards as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a €1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>, has seen Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot appointed as its co-CEO. Yep, that's Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son Charlie, who has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">insisted his appointment wasn't just down to nepotism</a>.</p><p>I reached out to Ubisoft for comment and the publishers stuck to their statement guns from earlier this week, with a spokesperson saying: "Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft.While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build."</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," they continued. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p>
<p>Côté was also very forthright in his defense of Shadows' devs in the face of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">online vitriol over Yasuke being one the game's protagonists</a>, in contrast to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">the elder Guillemot</a>. Here's hoping that Derennes and baby Guillemot are willing to do that kind of thing, but I'm doubtful until we see it.</p>

            <p>
There is a woman trying to get into my supermarket. She's banging on the sliding door glass, an urgent silhouette against swirling fog and darkness. My manager told me it's not safe outside at night, but the woman doesn't seem afraid, for all her banging. She is smiling. Not a nice smile. A Skibidi smile, all teeth and gums and painfully stretched skin. 
</p>
<p>
I do not think I should let the woman in, but she explains to me in text dialogue that I have it all backwards. <em>She's</em> not outside the store. <em>I</em> am. So really, if I let her in I'm only letting myself in. I do not find this gnomic insight reassuring. I tell her to clear off. She doesn't press her case, but comments before drifting away that there might be consequences later. I silently observe that I would rather have consequences later than consequences right now.

This is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellmart">Hellmart</a>, a grubby first-person job simulator in which you spend your days stocking shelves, cleaning the aisles and manning the checkout, and your nights attempting to secure the premises against a nebulous Evil. 
</p>

The daytime stretches are squalid and oppressive but relatively non-horrific. True, you might have to deal with paranormal antics such as self-slamming doors. True, the boxes of pasta on your shelves look vaguely like pictures of guts and eyeballs. True, the CCTV feeds on your computer by the till often reveal things that aren't there, or which hopefully aren't there. True, a lot of your customers sport that Skibidi smile, and true, it's unclear where they're from, exactly. The store sits in a waste of snow and forest, with locals emerging from behind a distant hill.
</p><p>
But that's all peanuts compared to what happens when the sun sets. I haven't progressed far enough to encounter some of the entities brazenly given away by the Steam page (and the below trailer), but it's telling that you can board up windows. The security measures immediately feel inadequate. Being able to padlock the doors is of minimal comfort, given the presence of patently xenomorph-friendly airvents. The option to hide in fridges just feels like offering yourself up as a snack.</p>
<p>The store isn't huge - it's a handbaskets-only joint, barely roomy enough to justify the supermarket label, but the head-high shelves carve it up into a larger labyrinth that is pleasingly efficient in its jumpscare potential. And then there are the people [citation needed] who bang on the glass. Some of them are probably safe company: it's up to you to decide, based on the things they say.

There's been a slight trend in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> about Letting The Right One in over the past year or so. Mark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-was-terrified-of-answering-the-door-before-playing-this-freaky-faced-apocalyptic-horror-and-honestly-it-hasnt-helped">wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-im-not-a-human">No, I'm Not A Human</a>, in which you are a post-apocalyptic hermit appraising the bona fides of night-time wanderers and Visitors. There's also the earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/">Look Outside</a>, in which you definitely shouldn't open the curtains, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone</a>, a chilly piece of military border policing that is hopefully alive to its own inhumanity. 
</p><p>
It's tempting to make connections with Covid lockdowns and lingering agoraphobia, but these are emotions that date back much further, of course - back through games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers, Please</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a> to zombie fables about the possibly infected and folk legends about vampires and thresholds. The major difference I sense in games like Hellmart is that the monsters often don't particularly bother to hide their monstrousness. The ghoulish thrill of these games is letting nocturnal callers cross the lintel even when you're 70% sure they're bad news, just to see what mayhem they wreak.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Find the Hellmart demo on Steam</a>. I'll conclude with the anecdote that I used to be a Tesco store cleaner, and the scariest thing that ever happened to me on-shift was two old ladies power-dunking jars of pesto and cream at either end of the store simultaneously - the janitorial equivalent of a Double Event in Pacific Rim. Mind you, now that I've played Hellmart, I realise how glad I am that I never had to lock up after dark. That Tesco was huge. So many sightlines. Pretty sure it had a meat locker as well.</p>
<p>It's out "soon". Bulgaria-based developers Gaze in Games are a new outfit founded by a former member of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> developers Clapperheads. If you're sold on the premise and don't want to wait, there's also the lower-fi <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">Kiosk</a> from Serbian developer Vivi.
