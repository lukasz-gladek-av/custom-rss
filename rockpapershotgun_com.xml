            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> has a new Headwinds game update that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">amongst many other things</a>, removes an extravagantly drawn-out puzzle from the game’s Buried City map. Introduced in December, the puzzle in question saw people tracking down and pushing 15 buttons in a certain order to unlock a secret chamber containing an actual, strummable guitar. As of this updating, you’ll now be able to buy that guitar at Shani’s, like a millionaire tourist paying to be flown to the top of Mount Everest. </p>
<p>I regard this as a dilution of the game, on paper, but I am not one of the players who’ve driven themselves crackers trying to get hold of the instrument (or paying real money for the battle pass to unlock it). Arc Raiders is a multiplayer game, of course, so even if you survive being shot at while stampeding between buttons, it’s possible another, distant player might innocently press one and reset your progress.</p><!--more-->
<p>I really like multiplayer puzzles, in general, especially when the game isn’t really designed for this kind of trickery. It’s hard enough lugging loot back to the elevator in Arc without getting a bellyful of bullets. One can only imagine the feats of cunning required to track down a bunch of buttons in parallel. One can only imagine the elation of bringing home the prize.</p>
<p>Still, reactions to the tweak on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pp7gdr/how_to_get_guitar_buried_city_music_puzzle_and/">Reddit</a> are mostly a mixture of contempt and relief. As one user points out, even if you unearth the guitar, there’s no guarantee you’ll have enough time to extract. Perhaps turning the guitar into a purchaseable item was all part of Embark's plan, after milking community desperation for a few weeks? It <em>is</em> a very nice guitar. You can play up to seven tunes with it. The difficulty of obtaining the thing may explain why so many wasteland buskers are getting shot in the head.</p><p>Read more about this and other Raider business in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0">the full changelog</a>. The devs have “fixed the Seedvault extraction glitch on Stella Montis that allowed players to remain in the extraction point after it had closed”. They’re also in the process of implementing a three strikes progressive ban system for cheaters, with bans progressing “from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders”.</p>
<p>Any successful examples of puzzles in multiplayer shooters to share? I guess the obvious ones to beat are still Destiny’s Raids, hashtag Vault Of Glass. There’s probably some good stuff in certain editions of Fortnite, but I forget.</p>

            <p>Y'know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> bug where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/further-testing-seems-to-confirm-monster-hunter-wilds-dlc-performance-improvement-theory-to-an-extent">close proximity to a talking DLC vendor cat would drop your framerate</a>? Gone. Dead. Done like a kipper. Do kippers exist in the Monster Hunter universe? Maybe not, but then neither does this bug, following a new PC patch for the troubled RPG and confirmed by my testing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Curiously, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">Capcom’s patch notes</a> claim that the FPS drop – which could previously be 'fixed' by splurging on MHW’s many, many add-on cosmetics – was more specifically triggered by the game’s content status checks flagging <em>unclaimed</em> DLC or items, with the total number of owned DLCs having no effect.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that aligns entirely with my pre-patch testing experience, as I still got a substantial performance boost on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> after adding all 190 cosmetics, and after manually combing through all of the DLC cat’s menus to check they were all installed. But at least whatever the cause, it does appear to have been properly addressed. Before this patch, and without any DLC, that RTX 5080 averaged 66fps around the camp area where the offending feline resides; with all the DLC, that rose to 73fps. After the patch, the same test rig produced 74fps with the DLC and 75fps without. Success!</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This particular fixin’ does little to help Wilds’ notoriously stuttery performance outside of camps, though the update does also include "optimisation improvements" and a couple of new graphics settings that can be lowered for a smidge of extra frames. Several denizens of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1qoyzdi/guys_the_game_runs_on_pc_now/">the game’s subreddit</a> are reporting noticeably improved smoothness after installing the patch, and while the upgrades I’ve seen myself haven’t been so dramatic – dropping the new foliage density from High to Low, for example, only gave the RTX 5080 another 2fps on average – they do sound like they might benefit lower- and mid-range PCs more acutely.</p>
<p>"To further improve stability and performance across all platforms," the patch notes continue, "additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18.</p>
<p>"For example, we are currently verifying measures to reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models. This may help to reduce processing load by swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera."</p>
<p>Reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> devs denied that the citybuilder ran so badly because it was rendering entire urban populations’ worth of individual, high-definition, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-blaming-teeth-for-cities-skylines-2-performance-problems-say-devs">dynamically growing teeth</a>. God, games are weird.</p>

            <p>
Fresh from the trenches of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">the Divinity generative AI debate</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has taken to the Twitterverse with some moderately spicy thoughts on video game critics and reviewers. Broadly, he feels that we need to work harder to be “critical” without being “hurtful”. He also suggests that the industry could do with a Metacritic-style system for evaluating and scoring reviewers, to “encourage a bit more restraint”, so that "sensitive" creatives don't "lose their idealism and love of players.”
</p>
<p>
Picture me over here, huffing and snorting like a bull eyeing the red-trousered bottom of an atypically fleshy matador browsing the inside of a just-opened china shop. By gawd! A chance to pontificate about my own navel, while bagging a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> headline in the bargain. I have some notes on Vincke’s notes, but before I start throwing my toys around, maybe <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974">read the Xitter thread in full</a>, from late last night on the 27th. For those who do not partake of Musky products, here's a transcript:
</p><!--more-->
<blockquote><p>I don’t like people shitting on things others have created. Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it'd be a good idea for critics to be scored, Metacritic-style, based on how others evaluate their criticism. I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint. The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want to publish something.</p>
<p>There's plenty of games I genuinely don't like playing and there are many I know are made for the wrong reasons. However - it's incredibly rare for one to be made without there being someone behind it that truly cared about what they were making, putting a part of themselves in it.</p>
<p>One of the best reviewers I ever knew refused to review games he considered failures. He believed that developers deserved the chance to try again. He knew that every failed attempt could be what enabled the next great one.</p>
<p>I know this because I was one of those developers that failed. And he only told me many years later.</p>
<p>So yeah - be nice to people that create things is what I'm trying to say. You need them.</p>
<p>And yes - I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say - I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough.  No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.</p>
<p>Or headlines if you're press.</p>
<p>Going to step down from my soapbox now. It's been on my mind for a while and just opening my feed today just pushed it all to the surface.</p>
<p>Think of the time you had to recite something in front of the class and how nervous you were. And how much any negative comment hurt.</p>
<p>Be nice to one another, be nice to the people creating stuff to entertain you. Treat them like you would like to be treated if you made something.  </p>
<p>Consider it a strategic investment in the quality of your future entertainment. You won't regret it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Following responses to his thread, Vincke wrote a postscript spelling out that devs shouldn’t indulge in personal attacks either, nor should they “milk players who love their game”. Rather, “what I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most.
</p><p>
“When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care," he went on. "The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players." Vincke suggests that “not playing the games is probably the best [way]” to reproach developers “that don’t respect players”.
</p>
<p>
I’ll keep my own thoughts brief-ish. I have some sympathy for the idea that critics should avoid personal attacks, inasmuch as there is a tendency with videogames to hang the work of many on the antics of just one, prominent figure, which means that both feats of collaboration and wider, structural problems may go overlooked. You could argue that making it personal also feeds an online culture of dogpiling individuals, and especially marginalised people who make for ‘easier’ scapegoats.</p>
<p>Still, it’s utterly ambiguous here where Vincke is drawing the line between “critical” and “hurtful” or "personal". And in any case, it can be appropriate to direct some outright vitriol at the people making a game, inasmuch as art expresses the values of its creators. You don’t get a pass for making poison just because you poured your heart into it. Sometimes, utter scorn is justifiable. If Vincke is serious about this conversation, I would encourage him to actually cite some reviews, games and game developers and discuss the finer workings.</p>
<p>I also have some sympathy for the idea that people trying to make art deserve a break, inasmuch as “creative” work under capitalism is often disparaged for being economically unproductive and "frivolous". But I think the making of art or other “creative” work is mythologised to the point that it encourages people to see any critique as an assault on their very being - and the conceit of artmaking as inherently brave, valuable and worth nurturing may be wielded to silence those who challenge the mantra that the creation of another product is an automatic good.</p><p>That fucking restaurant reviewer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatouille">Ratatouille</a> is wrong, in other words. One of criticism's most valuable functions - just as valuable as "discovering and defending the new" - is simply to say no in the face of structural pressure to rubber-stamp the next round of releases. This does actually have its risks: I've received plenty of death threats for scoring things 8/10 or lower, and in a media sphere that depends on traffic volume, there is continual ambient goading to approve of, or at least acknowledge games that already have some kind of mass following.
</p>
<p>
Some quick closing notes: a lot of the toxicity and personality politics of online criticism reflects the workings of particular communication platforms, like Twitter, which reward dunking and hot takes. The idea that a reviewer should avoid commenting on something they consider a failure is ridiculous, on paper. If you’re that reviewer, I’d like to read a defence of your decision not to write about Vincke's prior project. Oh, and as it happens, there are some halfway 'official' systems for evaluating and scoring critics. Go look up Rock Paper Shotgun’s TrustPilot page, if you can bear it.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> developers Paradox have decided now's the time for the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> to take a leaf out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-2-now-has-a-subscription-service-for-all-the-dlc">its predecessor's book</a> - as well as fellow strategians <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</a> and Europa Universalis 4 - by getting its own DLC subscription service. Starting today, you'll have the option to pay a monthly fee for access to all nine billion or so CK3 expansions and add-ons, if you don't fancy paying to own them outright in the usual fashion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>By taking out a monthly Crusader Kings 3 subscription via the marry your cousin to keep the crown sim's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">Steam page</a>, you'll be granted all all of its major expansions, plus the truckload of smaller add-ons Paradox have put out for it. The price is £8.49 / €9.99/ $9.99 per month, though Paradox do note there'll be "discounts for longer term subscriptions".</p>
<p>The idea behind offering this alongside the existing DLC buying options is catering to "players who’d prefer to play for a limited time or in a more budget-conscious manner". It's a chance for folks who only own the base game to try out all of the add-ons for a month, with Paradox's coffers hoping the end result will be said people opting to keep their subscription running or opt to permanently pick up some DLC they've enjoyed. As someone who got into CK3 as a newbie last year, I can see the appeal. Coming to a game that already has half a decade worth of pretty pricey DLC (even if you wait for a sale) out and discerning which bits add enough stuff you'll use that they're worth committing to isn't the easiest, even if there's plenty of reading you can do to help you judge.</p>
<p>As of writing, a subscription opens up all 25 bits of CK3 DLC included in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36586/Crusader_Kings_III_Collection/">Crusader Kings 3 collection</a>, which Steam tells me - a person who already owns the base game plus major expansions Royal Court, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">All Under Heaven</a> - would set me back just over £100 to buy right now. There are three other major expansions out right now - Tours and Tournaments, Legends of the Dead, and Khans of the Steppe. The rest are either cosmetics, or event/flavour packs designed to add more royal strategising scenarios you can take on/flesh them out with more choices.</p><p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-launch-dlc-subscription-service-for-hearts-of-iron-iv-today">Hearts of Iron</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/now-paradox-offer-a-dlc-subscription-for-europa-universalis-4-too">Europa Universalis</a>' subscriptions, this CK3 one looks as though it'll expand to include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-show-off-their-mysterious-ass-to-tease-crusader-kings-3s-2026-expansions">future DLC Paradox put out</a> going forwards too. It also shares a need to pay for the subscription on top of the base game, which makes this less appealing than it might otherwise be. There's also the fact that a good portion of the strategy game's add-ons <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">aren't necessarily things you'll miss greatly</a> if you've not got them. My three expansions plus base game setup's still got tons of scope to steal away hours of my life in the coming years, regardless of not having the likes of coronations or in-depth Genghis Khan simulation.</p>
