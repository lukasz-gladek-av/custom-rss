Another one for the "not news, but news to me" pile: you can download a free updated version of classic 4X space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Starships Unlimited from creator Andrew "APEzone" Paul Ewanchyna's website. Originally released in 1999 - an era of relative mental calm, before the Broadband Blight - it's a turn-based affair with four ages of technology to discover, a range of alien factions who (in the original version, anyway) all look like gurning hoover attachments, and the prospect of zesty tactical combat involving ships of your own design. 
</p>

<p>
There are few pleasures in the games journalist's life richer and more poignant than the opportunity to write about a game you'd totally forgotten you played. I didn't recognise Starship Unlimited at first, when I saw it on the 4X subreddit. The madeleine-soaked-in-tea moment was a screenshot of ships in orbit featuring firing ranges - arcs and wedges of yellow, red and green painted onto an invisible tabletop around each craft. I adored those firing ranges as a kid. I used to field highly specialised fleets consisting of acutely near-sighted, 360-degree firing escort cruisers and tunnel-vision artillery vessels that couldn't win a dogfight against a cactus.
</p>
<p>
The free version <a href="https://apezone.com/posts/201114/">available on APEzone's site</a> is Starships Unlimited 3.5 - sadly, Ewanchyna doesn't seem to have preserved the older versions, including the one I played with the (imo) very <em>best</em> nozzle-faced aliens. If you're interested, you'll need to sign up with your email to access the download page.</p>
<p>As ever with these projects, part of the thrill is the weird time-traveller condescension that comes from digesting a set of two-decades old system requirements. 50MB of HD space? Woah, guess I'll have to suck it up and delete my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> install. 64MB of RAM? I'd better close all applications before starting this game. Vintage spec sheet notwithstanding, Starship Unlimited seems to run happily enough on a current-gen Windows PC, like the Dell thinkpad I'm writing this on.
</p>
<p>
Stumbling on this has charged my torpedo tubes and suffused my phaser banks with rampant enthusiasm for games involving genuinely tactical fleet combat. Any lesser-known favourites you'd like to share? Anything new and unexpected, or old and unfairly overlooked?
