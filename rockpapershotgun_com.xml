            <p>
You know, sometimes I wonder if Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone ever sleeps. At any given moment it sounds like he's working on something, whether that be yet another update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-creator-breaks-silence-to-shoot-down-myths-about-haunted-chocolatier-including-that-2030-release-rumour">or the definitely still in development, just wait a while you silly sausages</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. And, as it turns out, somewhere along the line, Barone had even considered making Stardew Valley 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> to commemorate Stardew Valley's impending 10th anniversary, Barone was asked whether or not he'd consider doing a sequel as opposed to more updates. "Yeah, I would," Barone plainly responded. "In fact, I would love to because it would just be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012, when I started working with Stardew Valley. 
</p>
<p>
"There's something fun about the number of possibilities in a whole new world, which I think would be fun for me. It'd be fun for my team. We'd be really excited about it. It's a bit difficult because people are so attached to Pelican Town and to the villagers in Pelican Town. I do fear a little bit that if it's a whole new cast of characters, people might feel put off by that."
</p>
<p>
Barone also floated the idea of setting Stardew Valley 2 in Pelican Town again, using the same cast but with a new story, but believed he'd have the same problem as just setting it somewhere new. "There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don't know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier you could say is like the Stardew Valley 2, but it's a bit different of a game, so we'll see."
</p><p>
On making that comparison between Haunted Chocolatier and Stardew Valley 2, Barone noted later in the interview how he knows people are expecting his successor game to essentially be a sequel to the beloved farming game, something that weighs on him quite heavily. "That's been a constant struggle is like, 'Do I just do whatever I want and not think about the existing player base or do I try to please the existing player base?' And I feel like there's just going to have to be a little bit of a balance between those things."
</p>
<p>
The full interview is worth a read, as Barone is quite candid about a lot of his feelings and process towards Stardew Valley. Glad it's him making the thing and not me, sounds like a nightmare.

            <p>
The purpose of a Tamagotchi is to have a tiny, portable digital pet with you at all times that you can feed and feed and feed until it grows into something slightly bigger, different, a new creature almost. It's generally a sweet, albeit potentially irritating (the beeps…) little micro-game that may cause a touch of stress, but certainly no feelings of fear. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-full-bloom">In Full Bloom</a>, however, asks "what if your Tamagotchi was actually a blob of an organism with nothing but a mouth that you must continuously feed… or else…"
</p>
<p>
The Tamagotchi connection to In Full Bloom is an explicit one, the '90s classic toys are directly mentioned on the game's Steam page. Yet instead of finding the likes of Mametchi, or Kuchipatchi, or Ichigotchi, you just have… "the mouth." This mouth is, maybe, I'm not sure, something akin to an amoeba? Or really a lump of flesh adorned with nothing but a single orifice it uses to consume whatever you place inside of it. This, in its totality, is the game.
</p>
<p>
You take your mouse, you click and hold on an object with the left button, bring it to the mouth's mouth, and release. And bit by bit it grows. And you start to notice changes. Those dents, is it forming eyes? Right there… it has teeth now. More teeth. More teeth. Even more teeth, a dentist's nightmare amount of teeth. It continues to get bigger too, so you must feed it larger and larger objects until… well, I'm not sure. There's a demo available to try, but it only goes so far, though judging from the game's page it can get as big as a planet.
</p>
<p>
There is admittedly not much game here on a technical level. Yet it still makes for a deeply uncomfortable experience. Some excellent sound design fuels the sensations from dread as you contribute to this thing's growth. I was left with a few questions from the demo too, particularly around who I am meant to be if there is a person feeding it. Neat stuff! I won't sleep tonight! If you'd like to join me in the night terrors, you can try out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">here</a>.
