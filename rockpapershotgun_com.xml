            <p>Despite having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">initially indicated they'd prefer not to do so</a> if it could be avoided, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have now confirmed that they're holding off adding new stuff to the shooter while they focus in on improving its performance.</p>
<p>It's for the best, as issues with stability and bugs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">overshadowed the verdict players had on Helldivers 2's last big update</a>, Into the Unjust. Not all of the concerns raised by players recently were new as of that update, see the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-does-helldivers-2-have-such-a-bloated-install-size-on-pc-old-hard-drives-says-dev">long-beefy PC file size</a>, but the result's been a backlog Arrowhead would have struggled to avoid confronting.</p>

<p>To be fair to them, they haven't shied away from it or a commitment to doing a better job of communicating about the state of the game. In a new video, Helldivers 2 director Mikael Eriksson is firmly unducked and makes clear that updates adding new enemies, gear or twists will be a bit slower to arrive while the studio work on getting things running without hiccups.
</p><p>"The feedback that we've gotten has been very justified," he said. What I can say is that we're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things, to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state."</p>
<p>Eriksson added that some of the problems can be addressed "fairly quickly", whereas are a bit more complex, a sentiment the studio have regularly expressed when it comes to this build-up of buggy bits and bobs. "We are already making really big improvements. I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk more in detail about this hopefully quite soon," the dev added.</p>
<p>It's good to see Arrowhead being a bit more proactive with their comms than they have been in the past. Here's hoping they can solve at least a good chunk of the lingering issues, even if it's impossible to make every addition risk-free when it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">kicking off unintended consequences</a>.</p>
