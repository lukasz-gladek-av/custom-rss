Capcom are working on a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>, the wonderful 2006 Zelda-like in which you play a sun goddess in a wolf's body, roaming a world of ink and parchment. It’s being co-developed by M-TWO Inc, Machine Head Works Inc and CLOVERS Inc, and directed by original Okami game director Hideki Kamiya. I am tickled pink, I tell you. Find a trailer below.

There’s not much to share at this stage - the game doesn't even have a formal title - but we do have a little blurb from Capcom. Here it be: “Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.”</p>
<p>The trailer is a departure from the sumi-e-inspired visuals of the original game – it’s gaudier and, er, hairier. Perhaps a bit too busy for comfort, next to the crowded but crisp scrollwork of the first one. But there are plenty of familiar sights: the goddess Amaterasu herself, galloping through verdant fields, the spinning Reflector dish on her back, and the Celestial Brush dropping cheekily into view at the end.
</p><p>
I was not expecting a new Okami game in this, the year 2024. (I wasn’t expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-the-capcom-action-rpgs-first-new-instalment-in-almost-20-years">a new Onimusha</a>, either. Nice work, Capcom.) The first one is perhaps less amazing in hindsight – it’s messy in a way Zelda isn’t, with some stodgy action-RPG elements and some repetitive fights. But my goodness, it has vision and heart and imagination in spades. I still play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">the intro movie</a> now and then to perk myself up. I never did get round to playing Ōkamiden, the Nintendo DS spin-off. Time to change that, perhaps.
</p>
<p>It's something of a homecoming for Kamiya, who left Capcom to co-found PlatinumGames back in 2006. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinum-to-work-on-new-projects">he left Platinum to go independent</a>, commenting that he would "continue to create in my Hideki Kamiya way". He's been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/06/17/hideki-kamiya-hints-at-okami-2-and-bayonetta-3-5950079/">hinting about ideas for an Okami sequel</a> for years.</p>
