I know this is a PC games focused outlet, but I'd like to present to you the most PS3 coded game I've seen in a long while: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chains-of-lukomoyre">Chains of Lukomoyre</a>. Now, to be clear I mean this in the most loving of ways possible. That era of video games obviously set the foundations for the rinse and repeat we see in a lot of triple-A games these days, but there was still the occasional oddity out there that just had the right vibe. And I think Chains of Lukomoyre fits that vibe quite well.
</p>

<p>
In terms of plot, the game features a Slavic folklore inspired setting in an alternate post-WW1 world where "Allied experiments shattered reality itself." I'm no fan of war, but I certainly am a fan of reality shattering experiments. You play as a soldier on a quest to find a lost love, meeting all sorts of weird creatures along the way in a story that's described as a "reimagining of Orpheus and Eurydice through the lens of war, memory, and myth." There's a giant black cat, a hut with chicken legs, a creepy nesting doll, lots of good stuff.

<p>
It's a third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> too, and while the announcement trailer does show off some gameplay, it doesn't show a huge amount of what you're doing. The thing that really makes me say "oh, it's a PS3 game" is the presence of quick-time events, a staple of the console honestly. This isn't particularly exciting because nobody really likes quick-time events, it's really the mixture of Slavic folklore and wartime aesthetics that's luring me in. I've had enough of western fairytales, it's about time other cultures get their time to shine.
</p>
<p>
In any case, as of now Chains of Lukomoyre doesn't have a release date in sight, but you can at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3746310/Chains_of_Lukomorye/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
Unfortunately, it's that time of the month again. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developer 1047 Games shared a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341958451004088321/">post on LinkedIn</a> announcing that layoffs had taken place at the company. It was described as a "small group of valued 1047 Games team members," but as is par for the course for games industry layoffs, there was no mention of how many have been laid off - though of course the usual spiel about "redirecting resources" to make the game better. You know, classic corporation speak.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Notably, co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have apparently "opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project." This is normally where I'd say something like "credit where credit is due", because Proulx's father Tom Proulx is literally the co-founder of Intuit, a huge American software company, so I don't imagine him to be particularly hard done by with this decision. And, you know, this is the same guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wore that ridiculous hat at Summer Game Fest</a>, so you'll be hearing no compliments from me.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear as to whether this means Splitgate 2 is underperforming at all at the moment. The hat thing wasn't the only controversy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> faced, as the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">launched with some pretty ridiculous prices for some of its in-game items</a>. A one-two punch of a bad PR move and extortionate prices does not a healthy community make. In any case, as always I hope everyone that's been affected by the layoffs is able to land on their feet.

As it stands, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is not doing so hot. Across the board it's not been received entirely positively (including by our own James, you can read his review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">here</a>), not exactly the ideal launch for a live service game. All the same, it being a live service game might ultimately be its benefit thanks to the power of that mystical force called "updates." In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274">Steam post</a> shared by the FBC: Firebreak team, some planned improvements were outlined, which certainly sound like they'd make for a better experience.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First of all, the team made one thing clear: the game "will improve." Remedy explained that they've been listening to all of the feedback so far, and asked for any more that anyone might have. In terms of immediate plans for changes, the first thing they list is improving the first hour experience. They acknowledge that this is due to a "combination of things," like poor onboarding, how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> systems actually work, clarity in what to do in jobs, and there being too much of a grind for higher-tier weapons.
</p>
<p>
In terms of onboarding, Remedy plan to better communicate the "synergies between Crisis Kits and giving players much better information on what to do in the Jobs and how to be more effective in doing the work that Firebreakers must do." That means harmful conditions, like being on fire, being more readable. 
</p>
<p>
A new patch that arrived yesterday has already made it easier to access jobs, as you no longer need to play the first two clearance levels of each job, and completing the full job unlocks the next full job. The patch has also made Lost Assets and Research Samples more highlighted visually, so that it's harder to miss them. It's also rebalanced how much all of the unlockables cost too, and things like Altered Augments, Improvised Devices, and powerful weapons are easier to access. All of this was done to help with dealing with that grind.
</p>
<p>
There's a few more specifics in the Steam post you can read for yourself, and you can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920272?l=english">here</a>.
