            <p>
Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has hailed PC gaming's "increasing share of the market", in what you could optimistically interpret as the prelude to a GTA 6 PC release date announcement, and less optimistically, as a simple reassurance to investors who are fretting about the decline of console game sales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> is slated to release on Xbox and PlayStation in fall 2025. As per Rockstar Games tradition, the PC release remains TBA. For context, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> released on PC around 18 months after hitting Xbox 360 and PS3, while GTA 4 took an extra eight months or so, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> a year. 
</p>
<p>
This strategy of releasing PC versions late persists despite Zelnick's comment in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">Ian Games</a> that the PC version of a multiplatform game can account for over 40% of overall sales. "We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he told the site. "Of course, there will be a new console generation." 
</p>
<p>
Here is some slapdash background on the console biz, which is undergoing something of an evolutionary slow period. Only Nintendo - who basically operate their own games industry nested matryoshka doll-style inside the regular games industry - have announced their next big piece of hardware. We've yet to hear about PS6 and whatever Microsoft call the Nextbox, so there's a bit of a gap on the industry earnings forecast. In the meantime, the existing consoles are slowly petrifying like forgotten dragons, shipping fewer and fewer copies between them.
</p><p>
Zelnick reckons the release of GTA 6 might help with flagging console sales, even in a year when the US presidency is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-warns-of-negative-impact-to-come-with-trump-s-video-game-tariffs">picking lots of fights with trading partners</a>. And if it doesn't, hey, there's always the apparently thriving PC market.
</p>
<p>
"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," he told IGN. "And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."
</p>
<p>OK, so, once more with feeling: GTA 6 PC release date when? Being a bear of little brain, I can't really explain Rockstar's tendency to show up late on PC, but I imagine it's not a resource question, given that Rockstar have thousands of developers and still earn megabucks from GTA 5 re-releases and GTA Online. The explanation that makes most sense to me is simply that shipping on PC "late" is an excuse to double-dip - max out the console sales initially, then polish up the tech for re-release on more capable PCs and, presumably, the next generation of consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
