An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> live action film is in the works from Ex Machina director Alex Garland, film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco. It’s not clear whether developers From Software are involved, but Game Of Thrones novelist George R. R. Martin - who worked on Elden Ring’s story and characters alongside From boss Hidetaka Miyazaki - is contributing as a producer. All of this comes via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 Miyazaki has dangled the prospect of a movie adaptation in the past, while stressing that film-making very much isn’t his wheelhouse. “I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” he told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> last year. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium. So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play. We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.” 
</p>
<p>
There’s no word yet as to the story, characters and cast, let alone a release date. Perhaps predictably, I struggle to imagine a film that captures the ambience of a From Software game, in which so much of the charm is being the one real agent of change in a static, ruined world. But I can think of a few references for the moodboard: David Lowery’s silty cinematic adaptation of Gawain And The Green Knight and Matteo Garrone’s dynastic triptych Tale of Tales. Perhaps they could pay homage to the soapstone functionality by encouraging audiences to write “is this a dog?” on the box office posters.
</p>
<p>It'll be a while till we learn more, I expect. In the meantime, you can get your fix of Limgrave from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Fall Of Avalon is set in another dark reimagining of Arthurian myth, one less abundant in beauty influencers than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">Tides Of Annihilation</a>. It takes place about 600 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>'s fall, in a realm of "unending strife" and plague that is divided into three zones.</p>
<p>The game is said to span 50-70 hours, with over 200 sidequests and an assortment of miscellaneous activities such as decorating your house, farming and "sketchbook journaling". I sincerely hope that last one is a fully fleshed-out illustration subgame, or at least some kind of fantasy photography mechanic. We need more virtual idylls like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eastshade">Eastshade</a>.</p>
<p>One overarching device is that the world worsens at night - that's when the Wyrdness, "a chaotic primordial force", comes out to play, making foes tougher. I too experience Wyrdness at night, but this is generally because I have decided to eat a family-sized bag of Flaming Hot Wotsits. The Fall Of Avalon's Wyrdness is a touch less gastric in origin. According to the backstory, King Arthur actually ousted it many centuries before during his conquest of Avalon. Now, it's back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Avalon, you are an omni-capable RPG everyperson who can go about wyrdo-murdering using any combination of stats, perks and equipment. "Want to be a crazy alchemist-berserker punching enemies to death? Sure," promises the Steam blurb. "A mystical blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes? We've got you covered. A stealthy archer lurking in the shadows? Say less - this is the game for stealth archer enthusiasts." Cry more, Thief.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on everything I've read about the game. There's talk of a "mature, morally grey story", for example. "Mature" and "morally grey" are terms used by rosy-cheeked children to describe the act of lying about whether they've brushed their teeth. Between that and the boilerplate industry talk of "limitless playstyles", "meaningful choices" and "love letters" to the Elder Scrolls-style RPG genre, I doubt this will be very surprising on the whole.</p>
<p>Still, I quite enjoy the art direction's core theme of "everlasting autumn", and I like the environment design's somewhat Fromsofty sense of rot. Did I mention there's a plague? It's called the Red Death. A bunch of priests are searching for a cure by means of torturous experimentation upon victims who are slowly transforming into monsters. Perhaps it's the Flaming Hot Wotsits talking, but that sounds like just the thing for a Friday night. Let us know if you've played this and Have Thoughts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
