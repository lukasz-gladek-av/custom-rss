            <p>A brace of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> reporting has treated us to the first details of the game's combat system. Here are the headlines: counter attacks, weapon degradation and an energy bar that lets you perform power moves and dodge in slow motion. It's apparently reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> in that you have a stamina system and the dodge and counter timing can be tricky - a summary I would say also describes Punch-Out! from 1984, if I wanted to be a snarky little shitlord. There are no guns, just melee weapons that range from scavenged baseball bats to naginata polearms, looted from a spirit world of shrines and masked figures. </p><!--more-->
<p>Lob a naginata into an online gaming forum roundabouts now, and there's a one in six chance you'll seriously injure somebody who's miffed about all this. It's possible, mind, that they are miffed because some previewer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">innocently suggested that Soulslikes might be an influence</a> (the devs haven't spelled this out, as far as I know) and this fleeting observation has been internet-telephoned into the argument that Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> with schoolgirls. But also, they will be miffed because resenting Silent Hill's combat is integral to enjoying Silent Hill. It is the Silent Hillite's most treasured pastime.</p>
<p>I've held forth in the past about why the series absolutely doesn't need a combat system, and why any and all efforts to "improve" it with more complex mechanics are akin to putting wing mirrors on Pyramid Head. Lately, though, I've found peace in the idea that Silent Hill needing a combat system is Silent Hill's original curse. That need will always haunt the town's hospitals and schools - the ghost of a 'real' action game, tethered to this plane by the whims of commerce, trying to make sense of itself in a story about unschooled protagonists and squishy manifestations of self-loathing, doomed forever to be an uncertain mixture of pretty bad or fine but out-of-place.</p>
<p>It's not like Silent Hill f developers Neobards are breaking terrifying new ground for the series: Silent Hill 4 had weapon degradation already. The strangest aspect of the combat is a special move gauge that's tethered, Amnesia-style, to your character's mental wellbeing. The more spooked she is, the less slow-mo power attack juice she'll have at her disposal. This could be either a bruisingly artificial or clever way of raising the stakes during boss battles. Anyway, I remain more fascinated by the setting and story, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">read about here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A stickfellow in a top hat's just burst through a twentieth story window, taking a fatal tumble down the corporate ladder, and all because I lobbed a parcel at him. This kind of thing happens all the time in Stick It to the Stickman, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">beat â€™em up</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> devs Free Lives are set to release in early access form later this month.</p>
<p>It's glorious enough to forgive any frustration you might have been left with when publishers Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">announced late last year</a> that the corporate slapfest had been delayed into 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can probably make out from the trailer below, Stick It to the Stickman's premise is cathartically simple: "Stickmen need jobs, but more importantly, shareholders need growth. Climb to the top of the tower to crush your boss's nuts, and please note that 50% of office work is kicking stickmen out of windows." Once you brawl your way to the roof of the office in simply cathartic fashion, you fight the existing CEO for the honour of leading the corporate megastructure, and the power to choose between spitting in the face of or bowing before the cabalistic corpoverlords which rule all.</p>
<p>The game's finally set to come out in early access form on August 18, but you can get a taste of its floppy fisticuffs by giving a freshly-revamped Steam demo a go. I have, and as my first exposure to sticking a fleshy wrench in the gears of capitalism, it gets a big thumbs up.</p>

<p>You start off sitting on a park bench, then beat your way through a throng of job applicants gathered around the lobby of a skyscraper. Naturally, you're asked to provide a reference in the form of the name of a friend who already works at the firm. Once you're hired, your first task is to beat this old friend and Fortnite buddy senseless via slapstick scuffle. Then, it's off up the tower, climbing ladders and entering lifts that sound suspiciously like toilets flushing to reach ever new levels of suited sticks in need of dragon punching, spin kicking, or just having a coffee mug lobbed at their bonce.</p>
<p>Free Lives seem to have gotten the mix of hilarious body floatiness once a stickperson gets smacked and the weighty punch you want inflicting such a blow to have pretty close to the sweet spot. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>, the cartoony physicality's top notch. The jokes about capitalism are pretty damn funny to boot.</p>
<p>The devs are aiming to have Stick It to the Stickman's early access last for "approximately 12 months", with fresh additions being made each month. "We plan on expanding the corporation to include manufacturing, marketing, a science center and a doomsday bunker, as well as corporate lobbying," they write. "Each new job within the game will have unique gameplay. And each new job will take the player one step closer to the final chapter of the story."</p>
<p>I'm pretty hooked on booting execs out of windows thanks to the demo, so this is definitely on my radar going forward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unleash-blunt-force-castration-on-execs-when-stick-it-to-the-stickman-finally-launches-in-early-access-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'd love to say that Bloodgrounds plunged me into a crimson mist, but in practice, this arena tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with town-building feels as cosy as a pair of soft leather socci on a frosty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. The setup: you are a gladiator from a Roman-themed fantasy world, who has recently won his freedom in the arena. How is he celebrating his freedom? By becoming a gladiator manager himself, as he continues his quest for vengeance upon the Emperor who slaughtered his father.</p>
<p>I guess this is the optimal Russell Crowe career path, but still, imagine if he'd hung up his sword and reinvented himself as a carpet salesman. Instead of continuing the cycle of violence that was so cruelly forced upon you, you'd have to educate clients on pile density and antistatics while politely parrying their requests to hear about the time you ripped that Scandinavian's ears off with your toes.</p>

<p>People would point out that you sure have a lot of <em>blood-red</em> carpets in your carpet shop, har har, and you would smile delicately and consider your wine goblet and say "maroon and rose, actually". For every query like this, another maroon or rose carpet would appear in your shop and another townsperson would mysteriously go on holiday for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I forget why I'm talking about carpets. Oh yeah, that gladiator game.</p>
<p>Gladiators need to win the crowd, and Bloodgrounds is very much playing the hits (5% critical chance). Its tussles take place in handsomely decked pixelart stadiums boasting such ornamental fixtures as flaming torches and crucified bodies. Your characters and enemies move around according to an initiative bar along the top. There's a no-nonsense distinction between movement points and action points, which are used to perform regular attacks and special abilities, while consumables can be played for free.</p>
<p>The character classes seem both familiar and busily outfitted. There are helmeted thuggoes who can rope-dart people and stun them with a pommel; strutting retiarii equipped with throw-net and trident; archers who can set exploding traps from afar. Leering, scarred and eye-patched humans aside, you'll dally with mythical beasties such as spectral reapers and brazen quadrotor automatons. The arenas themselves have terrain fixtures such as mounted crossbows, and yes, the audience may lob in a power-up or two if they like the cut of your gibs. Preferably, your enemy's gibs.</p>
<p>Between clashes, you retire to your landscape-view villa where you can hire fresh meat and send any less than fresh meat to the infirmary. Much as in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Dankest Sturgeon</a>, you'll add and upgrade buildings with your winnings at other arenas, scattered across a world map of escalating difficulty. Each town facility has its talking head, and I find the writing and characters quite charming so far. Your architect, for example, is a sarcastic ghost sheep who probably began life in an Ovid story somewhere. Good for him.</p>
<p>Bloodgrounds launches this year. Developers Exordium Games are them wot did spacey shmup Last Encounter and horror comedy mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bear-with-me">Bear With Me</a>. It's published by Daedalic, who seem to have a thing for Romans lately - this January, they launched 4X strategy game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield_Fall_of_Rome/">Yield! Fall of Rome</a> from Billionworlds into early access.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-win-the-crowd-in-bloodgrounds-a-gladiator-tactics-rpg-with-darkest-dungeon-style-town-management]]></content:encoded>
