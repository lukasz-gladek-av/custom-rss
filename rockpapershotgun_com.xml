            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government urging action against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a> has been debated in parliament.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition</a>, which amassed just under 190,000 signatures prior to its closure in July, received a response from the UK government back in February, when it hit 10,000. "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games," this reply read. "Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue." As is the process, once it hit 100,000 signatures, it was eligible to be debated by parliament's petitions committee.</p>

<p>The debate lasted around an hour, and saw various MPs ask the government - represented by minister for sport, tourism, civil society and youth Stephanie Peacock - to respond to and provide extra clarity as to how its approaching the concerns set forth about game server shutdowns by the petition and some constituents. It also saw about a million game names be added to Hansard, the record of everything said in parliament, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> and a Super Mario World ROM hack trilogy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlMCTw5gTdk">Grand Poo World</a>.</p><p>In the end, Peacock stuck to the government's established line of making no amendments to the law, but working to ensure companies are providing consumers with the info they should when selling games. The government see the existing legislation designed to stop sellers misleading those buying goods by not providing accurate or complete info in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents">2015's consumer rights act</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2024/13/contents">2024's digital markets, competition and consumers act</a> as doing the job they need to, with Peacock saying: "The law works, but companies may need to communicate better". Meanwhile, in terms of the campaign's ask that publishers are mandated to provide a means for games to keep going after servers are switched off via a final patch or handing this over the community, Peacock said the following:</p>
<blockquote>The government is sympathetic to the concerns raised, but we do also recognise the challenges in delivering this from the video game industry perspective. First, this would have a negativen technical impact on video game development. It is true that there are some games where it would be relatively simple to patch an offline mode after its initial release, but for games whose systems have been specifically designed for an online experience this wouldn't be possible without major redevelopment. Requiring an end of life plan for all games would fundamentally change how games are developed and distributed. While that may well be the desired outcome for some campaigners, it isn't right to say the solutions would either be simple or inexpensive.</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the keys being handed to fan-run custom servers, Peacock pointed to a difficulty in determining who's then legally responsible for ensuring the game stays secure and complies with the law. Potential mixups which lead to people placing blame with the original developer or other harm to their reputation was another cited sticking point.</p>
<p>The government are considering taking one form of action based on the petition, that being having the <a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/">Chartered Trading Standards Institute</a> to put together specific guidance aimed at helping businesses ensure they're providing game buyers with the info the law requires.</p><p>The debate wasn't going to see the government suddenly do a 180 on their already stated response to the issue, but generally speaking I thought the MPs asking for clarification made some good points and had clearly done their homework. One thing in particular that caught my attention was Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon bringing up the recent deal for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">an investment group led by Saudi Arabia to take over EA</a> as the sort of corporate dealing that could see the waters muddied in terms of where the responsibility lies to ensure games do follow the rules in terms of server shutdowns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Labour MP Mark Sewards outlined his view that the government's current relatively laissez faire approach outside of making sure current laws are adhered to might not be ideal in the long run. "If we don't act now, the use of this model and the erosion of ownership rights may spread to other areas," he said. "I think that the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>
<p>This may be the end of the road for Stop Killing Games' UK petition, at least for now, but the wider campaign is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">in the process of preparing and waiting</a> for EU politicians to debate its citizens initiative on the issue.</p>

            <p>
Last month, Heart Machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-development-is-ending-in-early-access-and-devs-heart-machine-are-laying-off-staff">announced that they would be ending development</a> on their roguelike follow-up to the seminal indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. As a result, as is far too common in the industry these days, a number of staff were laid off - including a writer on the yet-to-be released Possessor(s). As a result, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2132890/discussions/0/786567268147400897/#c786567268147744312">post cropped up</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)'s</a> discussions page on Steam with some expressing discomfort at the idea of buying the game post-layoffs, prompting the game's narrative director to explain why he (understandably) would still like it if you bought it.
</p>
<p>
Harris Foster, representing the game's publisher Devolver Digital, explained in the comments that Heart Machine had confirmed that "all revenue-share eligible team members who contributed to Possessor(s) will continue to receive their share," including those no longer at the studio.
</p>
<p>
In turn, another comment from a user named Anthem of Grimm questioned whether people should buy the game or not "so that the developers that were fired can receive pennies on the dollar?" This is where narrative director Tyler Hutchison came in with a very honest response: "As a developer who is slated for lay off - PLEASE BUY THIS GAME!"
</p>
<p>
Hutchison broke down a few of the reasons why you should still consider buying the game, from the practical to the personal. For one, he noted how if the game ends up doing well, it could make those that have been laid off be able to find work easier; "'Oh you worked on Possessors? That game made a bajillion dollars. Please have a stable job with my company. Or Please have a bunch of money to make a new video game.'"
</p><p>
He also pointed out that everyone on the team made Possessor(s) "make games because we want people to play them and have fun. IF no one does that... I really just wasted 3 damn years of my life." And Hutchison also pointed out the profit sharing point, explaining that he knows he will receive a share, though didn't want to speak for everyone.
</p>
<p>
These are all generally quite fair reasons, and humanises the whole process in a way that is often quite corporate. How are we meant to respond when a company has layoffs? When it's a massive studio, it's unlikely enough people will stop buying their games to truly make a dent, but for a developer like Heart Machine, could it make the difference? I don't have the hard data to comment otherwise, still, it gives me pause.
</p>
<p>
There isn't a correct answer to any of this, it's ultimately up to you and your own moral compass in this situation. For what it's worth, Hutchison's explanation did convince Anthem of Grimm to pick Possessor(s) up, so if anything this is a good example of why we need more open conversations about these topics.
</p>
<p>
Possessor(s) is due out next week on November 11th.
