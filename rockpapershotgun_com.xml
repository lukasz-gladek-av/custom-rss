            <p>
It feels quite fitting that a game like Big Hops released today, the day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> wrapped up, because this thing feels like it has a guaranteed spot in Summer Games Done Quick already. You're a frog! Who hops around! What's not to love? It helps that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> feels so good in motion, too.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard of Big Hops before let me give you the proper run down. You play as Hop (get it?), a happy-go-lucky frog that is fooled into unleashing a mischievous spirit called Diss that I was half convinced was voiced by Elijah Wood for a minute (but is actually voiced by the very talented Ben Diskin, hey there Young Xehanort). Big Hops is very much a game that would not exist without, well, any 3D Mario, but it isn't beholden to those games either.

There's no triple jump, at least in the demo, but there is a crouch jump. There's some wall bouncing, but more critically there's some Breath of the Wildian wall climbing, complete with a stamina bar. And of course there's tongue swinging, rolling, mid-air dashing, a real mish-mash of original and borrowed ideas that have been cooked up into a game that feels incredibly tight, speedy, and most importantly of all, bouncy.
</p><p>
I like the sillier elements, like catching bugs with said tongue, giving them a good inspection before adding them to your collection. The environments feel neatly designed too, no wasted space, secrets to be found, and colours that make a nice meal for the eyes. It is a game I cannot describe as anything but delightful, and I look forward to finding the time to play the actual game, somewhere amongst the mess that is life!

            <p>
There is a strange deliciousness in experiencing a game from a perspective that it does not otherwise allow. Sure, things don't always look right, there's just this opportunity to rethink how you view a particular world. Recently, it appears that someone playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> got to do just that, by switching it into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooting</a> mode as opposed to its usual third-person camera, all thanks to an accident.
</p>
<p>
You see, over on the game's subreddit, user Short_Satisfaction_9 (I guess Short_Satisfaction_1-8 was already taken) shared a clip of themself playing the game in first-person using console commands. There's some obvious jank in the clip, you can see through the player-character's face at points which is always yucky, as well as their arms when they're doing some shooty stuff. This, however, is not a thing you are meant to be able to do, and has already been removed by developer Embark.

"We have just pushed a hotfix removing the 'NewConsole' command," community manager Ossen shared in a message in the game's official Discord (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-removes-a-hidden-first-person-exploit-just-1-day-after-it-was-uncovered-this-feature-was-never-meant-to-be-player-facing/">PCGamer</a>). "This feature was never meant to be player-facing. We're continuing to investigate related reports and may take action where appropriate to protect fair play and the integrity of the game."
</p><p>
Just because it exists in one sort of functional form doesn't mean you should expect it at any point in the future, as the devs have already said that it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/dont-count-on-arc-raiders-ever-getting-a-first-person-mode-once-you-start-being-able-to-put-your-face-right-up-against-an-asset-it-kind-of-falls-apart/">extremely unlikely they'll ever add one in</a>. Still! An interesting insight into another world where it is a first-person game, but one you'll have to find an inter-dimensional portal to travel to. Good luck?
