            <p>Attention, folks who like the idea of flinging a fire-breathing Group B monster down some dirt tracks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> devs Kunos are bringing out a rally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. It's called Assetto Corsa Rally, therefore instantly winning the inventive video game name award for this year.</p>
<p>As with road racing AC successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-evo-motors-into-multiplayer-racing-for-the-first-time-in-its-latest-early-access-update">Assetto Corsa EVO</a>, the studio and co-developers Supernova Games Studios have opted to go the Steam early access route for this selection of Scandinavian flicks, with a release penned in for November November 13 this year.</p>

<p>"Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts," Supernova studio director Mauro Notarberardino said in the game's <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-wishlist-now-on-steam/">announcement post</a>. "A special thanks goes to Kunos Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series — especially in terms of the driving model — in this new chapter."</p><p>I can't help but read that first bit as pointing straight to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">EA "pausing" development on future rally sims</a> at Codemasters earlier this year, leaving a DIRTy great Colin McRae-adjacent gap in the market the studio had regularly filled for 25 years or so. Naturally, as Brendy pointed out at the time, there are plenty of other great rally games out there to help fill the hole, but few offer the kind of in-depth realism of a cutting-edge sim.</p>
<p>As for what Assetto Corsa Rally will offer, Kunos and Supernova promise laser-scanned stages faithfully mirroring real life counterparts, the use of Assetto Corsa's physics engine to render everything from surfaces to weather, and cars ranging from 60s and 70s classics to modern trail blazers. At early access launch, there'll be ten rides including the likes of the Lancia Stratos and Rally2 class Hyundai i20N. The screenshots also include a Group B Lancia 037, a Seb Loeby early 2000s Citroen Xsara, and a 90s Delta. Stages on Welsh gravel and French tarmac will be on offer out of the gate.</p>
<p>By the time of full release, which the Steam page outlines is aiming to come in "less than 18 months", the studios' goal is to have five different rallies and a roster of over 30 cars up and running. The likes of a driving school and career mode are also planned. As a number of players have <a href="https://x.com/AC_assettocorsa/status/1979095945531797808">pointed out</a> in response to the announcement, it's a lot to take on while Kunos still have Assetto Corsa EVO in paid early access and in need of more additions before its 1.0 release. That said, the fact AC Rally's being co-developed is enough for me not to be too concerned, at least at this point.</p>
<p>You can wishlist Assetto Corsa Rally via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Steam page</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

If you are fond of snake ladies, sea snakes and staffs that look like snakes, you'll likely be hypnotised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Tides of Torment DLC, which adds three Legendary Lords representing the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly and Sega have just slapped a release date atop this serpentine assembly - 4th December. (PSA: Do not slap anything on real-life serpentine assemblies, unless you are a trained zoologist.) On that very same day, they're hosting a 25th anniversary showcase "unveiling what's next for the franchise".

Expect "new fantasy and historical project announcements, alongside commentary from the development teams shaping the future of Total War." Hopefully, one of the announcements will be that they've finally fixed Twarhammer 3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-developers-are-fighting-to-fix-a-catastrophic-failure-in-many-of-our-ai-systems">currently rather broken AI</a>. No point adding snake ladies if they space out whenever they have to recruit people.
</p><p>
While Tides of Torment will demand a few of your moneybucks, the pack will land alongside some free tweakage and a new campaign for noted demon sexpest Slaanesh. The latter introduces a pirouetting Legendary Lord who once danced at Slaanesh in a sort of sarcastic way, and was accordingly cursed to jig and caper for all eternity. I wasn't aware it was possible to dance sarcastically. I wish I'd known this as a teen.
</p>
<p>
"Coming free as part of Patch 7.0 is the Masque of Slaanesh Legendary Lord, providing a brand-new campaign experience for the excess-driven forces of Slaanesh," Sega explain in <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/mark-your-calendars-for-december-4th-new-total-war-warhammer-content-arrives-alongside-the-25th-anniversary-showcase">their press release</a>. "Alongside her arrival, the High Elves, Slaanesh and Norsca will receive new legacy updates, allowing players to return to past campaigns and experience a host of new gameplay improvements."
</p>
<p>
Total War turning 25! It feels like only yesterday that I was defending Mikawa province against three factions simultaneously in the original Total War: Shogun. I'm not sure Twarhammer 3 players are in the mood for celebrating - the hitherto-popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s Steam user rating is still Mixed to Mostly Negative, as reviewers rage about everything from DLC pricing through the AI problems to Creative Assembly's communication. Still, perhaps we can fit in a hymn to the glory days alongside some criticism of the missteps.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a>'s offline mode is now live, ensuring that the racer "remains accessible for years to come". Well, assuming you're not bothered about playing online, which would still be deep-sixed if Ubisoft opted to shut down the game's servers, as they did with its predecessor. Odds are that won't happen at least in the immediate future, due to the player feedback the publishers have credited as the impetus behind this addition.</p>
<p>That acknowledgement very much looks to be a way of nodding to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>, who rose to prominence following Ubisoft's shutdown of  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">the first Crew's servers</a> - thereby rendering it totally unplayable - without naming them directly.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR">offline mode</a>, dubbed hybrid mode because cars, has taken a year to leave the garage following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">announcement</a>. Jumping into The Crew 2 now sees you offered a choice as to whether you want to play online or offline, with the latter not boasting the mandatory internet connection which led <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>'s shutdown to play out how it did.</p><p>As you might expect, playing offline's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">rather stripped-back experience</a>, with the likes of the race creator, livery editor and custom liveries, leaderboards, ghosts, and the stats menu being sliced away in addition to the more obvious online bits. Any vehicle packs, season pass stuff, or Ubisoft Connect rewards you've bought or unlocked have to be claimed in a house or HQ in online mode before you can use them offline.</p>
<p>The online and offline modes have separate save systems, allowing you to carry online progress into offline play by exporting your online save to offline mode, but not letting you bring any progress you make while playing offline in the opposite direction. There's also a bit of reading to do in terms of how the switching between the two handles your in-game cash.</p>
<p>"When you choose Export to Offline Save, your current Crew Credits balance is included in the offline save file," Ubisoft wrote. "That offline balance can be used to purchase eligible items while playing in Offline Mode, for example, vehicles available in the offline catalogue. However, some items that are only purchasable via the online Crew Credits storefront (notably vanity items and some bundles) are not available in Offline Mode. If you purchase additional Crew Credits while online after exporting, you must re-export your Online Save to update your Offline Save and include the newly purchased credits."</p>
