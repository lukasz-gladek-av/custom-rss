            <p>What's the pettiest reason you began to distance yourself from an old friend? I once casually suggested to a mate that I found toast more filling than bread, which prompted them to bang on for far too long about how I was actually wrong, since the act of toasting necessarily diminishes the structure of bread or somesuch. I'm not sure whether that's true and I don't care. I was speaking my truth about toast and you undermined it. Jog on, toast denier.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s new Ghoul Within update is 18.9 GB, which may well conclusively prove that searing ghoulification actually ends up with the victim weighing more than they did previously. I wish I'd known this at the time of my yeasty bust-up, because I'd have probably tried to make the same argument about toast. We might have stayed mates then. Maybe we could have played Fallout 76 together? Why, that's the subject of this very <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/">Steam blog</a>! Incredible.</p>

<p>Your journey to "Ghoulification" begins with a new questline named "Leap Of Faith" in the Savage Divide. Do that, and you'll be able to transform into a Ghoul, complete with 30 new perks and two new abilities. Glow increases your maximum health depending on how radiated you are, and Feral confers combat buffs and penalties depending on how many drugs you've eaten.</p>
<p>Being a Ghoul will negatively affect your interactions with factions like the Brotherhood Of Steel and lock you out of certain questlines. If you're starting to feel isolated, you can either don a disguise or reverse your ghoul-hood altogether. This is permanent, though. If you want to become a ghoul once again, you'll need to cough up 1000 atoms - about £8/$10.</p>
<p>Alongside a new Level 50 Character Boost and a new event starting April 29th - "The Big Bloom" - the patch notes also detail a host of balancing tweaks. I'm particularly fond of the helpful mundanity in "adjusted some Perk names for better alphabetical sorting". The game's also 75% off on Steam right now, in case you aren't saving for the rumoured imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a>. It's… actually only slightly more expensive than that ghoul reversal charge. Love to be a fan of videogames in 2025. Probably just play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a>, innit. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That and a multitude of smaller tweaks and fixes.

Witness the crossplaying in the below trailer, in which a base-vandalising Astegon gets its bell rung by a group of visitors presumably running foreign hardware. That'll learn 'em to step on my Lamballs.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/571499455390418195?l=english">The full patch notes are on Steam</a>, but I'd hate you to spend any more time in that terrible, terrible place than you have to, so in the spirit of Crossplatform Playfulness, I'm posting the highlights below.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
・Crossplay!</p> <p>Cross-play is now available across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
・Global Palbox </p> <p>Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!
</p>
<p>
・Dimensional Pal Storage</p> <p>A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.
</p>
<p>
・Cosmetic Armour System!</p> <p>You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character's appearance without affecting armour stats!
</p>
<p>
・Photo Mode</p> <p>Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.
</p>
<p>
・Drafting Table</p> <p>Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!
</p>
<p>
・Dedicated Servers for Mac 
</p></blockquote>

Legal fisticuffs with Nintendo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> updates aside, Pocketpair have recently gotten into games publishing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">Their first collaboration is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios</a>, the people behind Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU. The move into publishing doubles as a spiritual dividend for Palworld players who now look with horror upon their sprawling empires of Pokélike slaves. Rest easy, ye fretful caPaltalists - your blood money is being used to fund a new generation of indie games.

It's been four months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a> was released, starting life as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">really great shooter that had more tech issues than you can shake a stick at</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> have kept themselves busy with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections">hefty patches</a>. The first one alone had almost 2000 fixes, with the second one following that up with more than 1700. As of today, patch 1.3 is here, this time bringing in over 1200 changes, fixes, and improvements. Obviously quite a bit less than the previous two main patches, but a sizable figure nonetheless, and hopefully a sign that the game is getting to a healthy point.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on Steam, GSC Game World highlighted a few of the more notable changes that come with the patch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/831582351143207687">Steam</a>, covering a broad range of aspects like AI, general balance, story bits, audio bits, and story progression. On the AI and combat front, mutants' movements during combat are smoother now, and NPCs will have an "improved" reaction to hearing the sound of footsteps.
</p>
<p>
Balance wise, A-life encounters will generally be a bit rarer now, and arch artifacts have had a rebalance themselves; weird water has decreased radiation protection, and weird flower has an increased smell masking effect now for example. There's also a bug that could let players "permanently stack the effect of unequipped artifacts" that has been fixed now too.
</p>
<p>
I really can't list out all of the other patch notes here as there's just too many, which continues to be impressive work from GSC Game World. You can check the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes</a> if you're that desperate to take in every single change. And in case you were wondering, this won't be the last update either, CSC Game World did also note that they have already started working on the next update.

            <p>
I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go.
</p>
<p>
Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in.
</p>
<p>
Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081690/Chromatic_Conundrum/">right here</a>.
