How do you follow up a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/umurangi-generation">Umurangi Generation</a>? Maybe move from photography to videography, or go full shooter (which developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/origame-digital">Origame Digital</a> do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/umurangi-generation-dev-teases-new-horror-game-inspired-by-metal-gear-and-silent-hill">appear to be making too</a>, that one's just not had a full reveal yet). Perhaps instead of either of those things, you'll make a game about penguins, which, yeah, no more beating around the bush, that's exactly what they've done. Introducing: Penguin Colony, a narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game based on H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a> explains that this is a "radically different perspective" from the original piece of literature, in part because you play as a penguin who hears the "echoes of our narrator describing his plight." It's looking like it's somewhat level-based too, letting you waddle, slide, and swim around, discovering what happened "at your own pace." A pretty chill sounding time for a game with such heavy source material!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the narrator isn't having a great time, his brain experiencing time out of order after being called by "the old ones," leaving you, a simple penguin, the only one that can help him. Good stuff.
</p>
<p>
There even seems to be a suitable amount of gaminess to it too, as you can unlock different penguins for replays. They all have different abilities and challenges too, one of them being a baby penguin so you can fit in smaller gaps, but you can't swim.
</p>
<p>
Look, Umurangi Generation is up there as one of my games of the decade, so I'll be here day one whenever it does drop. Over on the Umurangi Generation Discord server, lead developer Veselok said that a trailer and demo will be turning up in the coming months, so my advice is to wishlist the game on Steam if you're interested in checking it out.

Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair announced their intent to get into games publishing using some of that Scrooge McDuck-size swimming pool of money they've acquired over the past year. They already had a game signed up too, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">from Tales of Kenzera: ZAU developer Surgent Studios</a>, and today said indie dev has offered a small tease of a reveal at their upcoming psychological <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Dead Take.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For now the game is mostly wrapped in mystery, but it's apparently all about taking a look at the "darkest secrets" that lurk underneath the "glittering facade" that is the entertainment industry. You'll step into the role (pun intended) of an actor exploring a mansion to "piece together the story of how far a powerful executive will go to seal his legacy." There's object-based puzzles to solve, and you'll need to edit video clips you find to figure out what happened there. No full trailer just yet though.

<p>
In a statement Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim said that they're "being secretive" about the game "for a reason," continuing on to say that the "subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this.'" 
</p>
<p>
For some context, before getting into game development, Slim was an actor, having appeared in Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves and Napoleon, House of the Dragon, and on the video game front he was also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>' Bayek, as well as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera's</a> titular Zau. One can only imagine the stories any actor working on such big names might have.
</p>
<p>
Release date wise it's supposedly launching this year, but for now you can wishlist the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam</a>.
