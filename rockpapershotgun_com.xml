            <p>A decade on from its 1.0 launch, action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-dawn">Grim Dawn</a> is getting some new Fangs of Asterkarn DLC that adds 5.5 square kilometres of in-game terrain. Picture the extra geography barrelling out of the atmosphere like a boisterous asteroid, teeming with bosses and minibosses and unique items. Look out below!</p>
<p>The DLC will increase the size of the base game by 76%, and will be prefaced by a free update with a new scaleable UI and revised stash feature, offering dedicated crafting and components pages. My, my, Grim Dawn, you’re certainly looking sprightly and well-padded, for a Diabbler of your seniority.
</p><!--more-->
<p>“Fantasy/horror action RPG Grim Dawn is a huge and slick affair which clings tight to a doomy tone, eschews online funny business and is careful to keep lore overload at arm's length,” Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grim-dawn-review-2">wrote back in 2016</a>. “A lack of overblown cutscenes aside, you'd never guess that it was made comparatively under the radar and on surely a fraction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iii">Diablo III</a>'s budget.” 
</p>
<p>Grim Dawn certainly found an audience both during and after early access, as developers Crate Entertainment recall in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219990/view/532124583945306256?l=english">an anniversary Steam post this week</a>. “Grim Dawn's success enabled Crate Entertainment to grow from a studio of just 8 people to a team of 29 today, with 4 projects currently in development,” they write. “Your early support has allowed us to not only stay independent from publishers, but to pour our passion into each of our creations.
</p><p>“Likewise, when we started, we never could have imagined that 10 years later Grim Dawn would not only still be receiving major updates but it would have another expansion on the way. Our engineers bent the old engine to their will. Even as recently as last year, we addressed bugs that have been there since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titan-quest">Titan Quest</a>. 
</p>
<p>“Across 82 updates both big and small, we refined and polished, revamping everything from melee animations to how Nemesis bosses spawn on the map. We overhauled loot tables and added loot filters, revamped UIs and smoothed out the difficulty unlocks. Now with v1.3.0 on the way, truly nothing feels off the table to make the game better for you.”
</p>
<p>You can read a playtest changelog for v.1.3.0 <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/v1-3-0-playtest-changelog/150992">here</a>. This being an ARPG, it includes a lot of sentences like “Hamster of Ventriloquism Deafening Modifier Increased to 300/s”. I leave it you veteran Grim Dawners - now presumably well into the Dismal Afternoon of middle age – to make sense of things.
</p>
<p>The developers had planned to wind things up with Grim Dawn's second expansion, Forgotten Gods, in 2019. They figured that “sales would naturally decline” thereafter, but were caught out by growing player counts in 2023. “Despite having 3 games already in development, we knew we had to reassemble the team for one more loop around the sun,” the Steam post enthuses. “As it turned out... that may have been a bit of an understatement as we enter 2026!”
</p><p>Fangs of Asterkarn development is now “in its final stretch”, and they’re absolutely sure this time that it’ll be “Grim Dawn's final hurrah”. You can expect over 60 new bosses or minibosses, 370 unique items, eight new nemesis monsters, and 116 monster infrequents. The DLC will also add a new alchemy system, “awakened Epic items and Affix Rerolling”, a 10th mastery, and a new class combo maximum of 45.
</p>
<p>Not having played Grim Dawn, I can only gaze in terror upon the bulk of this jargon. But I <em>can</em> get my head around the concept of shapeshifting - “a system we once thought was untenable in this old engine”. Sounds like there’s a juicy story there. In general, I’m automatically pleased and interested by efforts to keep older games in the pink. All we need now is a release date for Fangs of Asterkarn, but alas, there is none.</p>

Colony sim and city builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-medieval">Going Medieval</a> will leave early access on 12th March, at which point it will presumably be retitled Gone Medieval. Yes, this is the sort of joke that ought to get you imprisoned – imprisonment being one of many features added to Going Medieval since the winter of 2021, when Sin described it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/going-medieval-is-a-buildier-friendlier-rimworld-spinoff">“a buildier, friendlier Rimworld spinoff”</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Other elements introduced over the long, increasingly Medieval years include fire, water, siege weapons, and a trading system. The 1.0 launch will bring “a proper endgame, wonderful improvements, new content, and a lot of achievements”, write developers Foxy Voxel on Steam. God be praised! Break out the good wine, slaughter the prize calf and let the trumpets ring from the battlements! Here’s a trailer.

<p>
If you’re enticed, but worried this game might prove <em>too</em> Medieval in practice, the other good news is that Foxy Voxel have put <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435830/Going_Medieval_Demo/">a new demo</a> that “adequately portrays the first few hours of the Going Medieval experience”. I both enjoy and resent the sudden self-deprecation of “adequately” here, lurking within the rhapsodic verbiage like a single shrugging potboy in a crowd of cheering peasants. Away with you, young master Adequately! Take your goatish visage back to the kitchens. We have a banquet to prepare.
</p><p>
Sin wasn’t alone in her enthusiasm for Going Medieval. Nate (RPS in peace) was keen too, albeit similarly blunt about the project’s influences. “Just imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a>, but with lutes and stuff, and you can build things on top of each other,” he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/going-medieval-is-a-rimworld-clone-with-one-brilliant-game-changing-difference">wrote</a> following the early access launch. “That really is a big deal, though. I’m almost embarrassed by how huge a difference it makes to me, to be able to build proper halls with thatched roofs, stone keeps looming over forests, and cellars packed with smoked meats and hay.” 
</p>
<p>
Me, I’m most thrilled by the idea that in-game research involves actually writing books, which then need to be kept in a library. If the books are lost, you’ll need to replace them before you can make further advances. It's the kind of naturalistic flourish that definitely won't drive me crazy when I accidentally burn my castle down.
