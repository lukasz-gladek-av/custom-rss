            <p>SSR Wives: The Murder Of My Winter Crush is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> for people who like the chibi proportions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> and also, people who hoot in adoration when they see a low-poly model of an iMac. I am both of these people. Created by Hen Studios with a demo on Steam, it's a sour and sugary blend of survival horror and romantic visual novel. You play one of several anime characters with names such as Tradgirl and Chudboy, all trapped in The Town That Time Forgot.</p>
<p>Those mouth-wateringly chubby iMacs? They are save points, the local equivalent for Resident Evil's typewriters. Excellent work, game. You have reminded me of my advancing age in a way I actually enjoy.</p> <!--more-->

<p>The Town That Time Forgot probably should have been named The Town That Time Deliberately Crossed Off The Xmas Card List Because It's An Absolute Shithole. Here you will find "liminal labyrinths", an abandoned missile silo, and a "clown carnival". Also an "antiquated bakery", but I wouldn't touch the bread. It's doubtless liminal bread, with always angries up my guts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2880000/SSR_Wives_The_Murder_Of_My_Winter_Crush/">The Steam demo</a> offers up a bunch of rusty tunnels and toilets where you will encounter hungry giant rats. Later, there are gnashing pumpkin monsters and assorted mutant clogboggoes with guillotine arms.</p>
<p>Where does the romance component fit in? Well, if you get to know and carry out quests for the locals you might be able to date them, presumably paving the way for one of multiple endings. Beware, however, that the town's residents are "inflicted with disorder", that the game's terrors are projections of their sins, and that you must "balance their emotional connections with the need to survive". To which end, SSR Wives harbours a sizeable assortment of shiny, real-world guns, which look almost cute in each character's mitts until you fire one and turn a rodent into a casserole.</p>
<p>I worry SSR Wives might be throwback to the point of being obnoxious. This is a game that describes non-tank controls as for "cowards", which I would deem "feisty" if the controls worked perfectly: instead, I got chewed apart by a rat because my character refused to strike downward. The Steam page lists "classic door scene transitions" as a feature, which feels like pandering and makes the game sound like a jigsaw of references.</p>
<p>Still, this is a potent demo, and perhaps not as straightforwardly "retro" as billed: there's something going on here with the intersection of fourth-wall-nibbling anime puppetry and cathode-ray Konami squalor I'm still deciphering. The full game is out this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ssr-wives-is-a-sparky-throwback-survival-horror-with-romantic-intentions-and-imacs-for-save-points]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/supermassive-games">Supermassive Games</a>, best known for developing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-pictures">The Dark Pictures</a> Anthology, have announced they've begun the consultation process for a round of redundancies that'll affect "up to 36" staff. As part of this, sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Directive 8020 has had its release delayed to early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supermassive have confirmed that the development of puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a> hasn't been affected by these job cuts, with that game still being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better">on track to come out October 10th</a>.</p>

<p>In a statement posted to social media, the studio blamed these layoffs on a need to "better align" with the games industry being "a challenging and ever-evolving environment", whatever that means.</p>
<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected," Supermassive wrote, "We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans."</p> <div>

<p>This latest round at layoffs follow the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">laying off around 90 workers in February 2024</a>, citing similar reasoning to that which they've employed here in a social post that looked pretty similar too.</p>
<p>Directive 8020, a standalone entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">first leaked back in 2022</a>. Supermassive pencilled in a 2025 release for it as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">a proper announcement last summer</a>, which showed off a game the very much looked like it'd be putting the phrase 'in space, no one can hear you scream' to the test. It's all about a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash landing on a planet and its crew then having further bad times as they're hunted down by an alien organism in true Xenomorphy fashion.</p>
<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," reads the first line of Directive 8020's blurb, which I wish didn't vaguely feel like it unintentionally reflects the mood in the games industry right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020]]></content:encoded>
