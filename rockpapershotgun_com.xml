            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s launch day patch was promised to be a big one, and EA weren't lying. The full notes have just arrived ahead of the shooter's launch tomorrow, October 10th. They're over 2700 words long. That's about double the length of my last feature, but solely dedicated to stuff like recoil and times to murderdeath.</p>
<p>If you played the beta, is there anything left you'll actually recognise when you fire up the full version? I've no idea, to be honest, they could have hidden a line about swapping every character model for Mr Bean in here and I'd likely have struggled to clock it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update's dubbed Patch 1.0.1.0 and EA say it's all about "addressing bugs, refining balance, and enhancing clarity throughout the entire experience". I shudder to think how beefy its file size might be.</p>
<p>Headlining as "major updates" are a lot of the things the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-hefty-launch-day-patch-will-bring-over-200-changes-and-ea-know-folks-pine-for-the-sea">announced earlier this week</a>, when they also said they'd heard folks crying out for the ocean. Namely, the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Movement is refined with reduced slide-to-jump momentum, lowered jump height, and increased inaccuracy when firing while airborne or sliding.</li>
<li>Weapon handling has been rebalanced through general recoil tuning and adjustments to ensure more consistent gunplay.</li>
<li>Rush and Breakthrough layouts revised to deliver a better balance between Attackers and Defenders.</li>
<li>Maps improved with better traversal, lighting adjustments, and overall performance upgrades.</li>
<li>UI and HUD have received a range of polish improvements for clearer prompts, smoother navigation, and more accurate displays.</li>
<li>Settings and controls expanded with improvements across multiple areas.</li>
<li>Audio overhauled game-wide with clearer pings, refined weapon and vehicle sounds, and fixes for missing or delayed effects.</li>
<li>Netcode optimized to reduce desync, fast time-to-death, and instances of invisible damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all of those? Good, you've only got a further 2667 words by my count to go. If you've not equipped the tactical version of your traditional Sunday Papers reading monocle and comfy slippers, I suggest you do it now, Lieutenant videogames.</p>

<p>Right, your eyes are almost certainly clinging on for dear life now, so here's a quick reminder that you can find the exact times for Battlefield 6's full launch on October 10th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">here</a>. It's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Edwin's review</a> too, the first paragraph alone had me saluting and pressing F to pay respects to his writing skills. Yes, I know that last bit's a Call of Duty gag, but let me have it.</p>
