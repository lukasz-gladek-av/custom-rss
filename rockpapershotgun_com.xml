            <p>
Cyanide and Nacon have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a>, the third in a trilogy of goblin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games known for puke-based mechanics and many a snarky note-to-self. I never completed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master Of Shadows</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-shards-of-darkness">Styx: Shards Of Darkness</a>, and if I'm honest, I fear Cyanide's impish infiltrator is doomed to forever butt his smirking, warty head against the 6/10 glass ceiling, with Thief's Garrett flashing V-signs on the other side.</p>
<p>Still, I have a certain respect for the series. There aren't many third-person sneakers like this any more, still fewer that have successfully gotten away with a protagonist who sounds like a chaddy Sam Fisher and looks like he should be cleaning toilets in Moria. So a quiet hip-hooray, then, for the Blades Of Greed, which is out later in 2025. Here's a trailer.

What's the Green Plague up to in this one, then? The usual, from the looks of it: clambering up massive citadels, shivving or bamboozling their guards, cracking the bad kind of bad joke, making away with the treasure. You can still sick up a clone of yourself and turn invisible using Amber, but you also get powers derived from a new energy source, Quartz - these include mind control and time manipulation. 
</p>
<p>
The story is about stealing Quartz from the human Inquisition, and takes you via airship to three large environments - "The Wall, which marks the boundary of the human world; the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn; and the Ruins of the elven capital, Akenash". New areas become available within those sandboxes via "Metroidvania-style" tool-gating. You'll also get to craft weapons and potions before undertaking each heist.
</p>
<p>
The setting has always been Styx's big draw for me. All that cobbled-together, piled-up masonry, buttressed by some respectable grimdark lore. I share Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) distaste for the character's internal monologue, however. "Clearly, a lot of money and skill has gone into making Shards Of Darkness, which only makes the fact that you have to battle past this woeful characterisation to get to the strong stealth meat below all the more tragic," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-shards-of-darkness-review">wrote of Shards Of Darkness</a>.</p>
<p>Re-reading that review, I'm struck by the mention of rampant fourth-wall-breaking, which I don't remember being quite so abundant in Master Of Shadows. Hopefully they've eased off on it in Blades Of Greed. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Find out more on Steam</a>.

            <p>Longdue Games have shared the first gameplay image from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hopetown">Hopetown</a>, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> "spiritual successor" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>, coming soon to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown/">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>First namelessly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">teased last October</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">The Great Disco Thrupening</a>, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-psychogeography-est-of-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-is-a-gonzo-journalism-rpg-named-hopetown">revealed last month</a>, Hopetown was described as "merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of Disco Elysium with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planescape-torment">Planescape: Torment</a>."</p>

<p>At the time, I hoped this tone and tenor of trying too hard<em> </em>was just press release guff. No such luck, if the writing shown off below is any indication.</p>

<p>But let's first back up a moment, because it does <em>look</em> great. So great I'm having some difficulty believing this is what the game looks like, rather than just being concept art. It's stunning. The purple and yellow palette. The painterly style, soft but sharp with detail.</p>
<p>Then you start reading. "Let me introduce myself," says your character to a sweet old lady feeding pigeons. "I don't shit in my own drinking water - though I see that's not a deal-breaker".</p>
<p>In Disco Elysium, your character could find a leather jacket with "Fuck The World" written on the back. If you tried hard enough, you could even convince your partner Kim to wear a complimentary jacket that read "Pissf****t". Someone at Longdue evidently thought those jackets were a good baseline for character development.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I'm viewing this dialogue through eyes pre-exhausted by Longdue's description of your character as "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel" and "unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged". Disco Elysium was frequently self-satisfied, show-offish, and overly slick. But it wasn't ever, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rr56tvKSe28">Nathan Barley on the bus</a>.</p>
<p>The pigeon lady offers your character a loaf of bread. You've got three responses to that, one of which is categorised "Noblesse N'oblige". I like that name. The dialogue itself is "I'd rather lick the bin [knock the bread from her hands]" - a jejune and obliviously mean-spirited interpretation of why the chaotic cringe comedy options in Disco were so much fun.</p>
<p>Your "Gonzo" option is: "Yeah, feed the masses! So let it be done. EAT UP, SKY RATS! (Take the bread)". You ever see a sentence that reads like someone wrote the exclamation points first and worked backwards from there? The attempts at understated philosophy feel just as unconvincing: "They give the filth on the ground a fighting chance to touch the sky. That's admirable".</p>
<p>I don't expect or even especially want a carbon copy of Disco Elysium from Hopetown, but if you're going to piggyback off the imagination of people that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report"> have allegedly had their work stolen from them</a>, apparently justified by the sole contribution of a lone systems designer from an outsourced studio (who I'm sure is excellent at their job and likely had no say in the "spiritual successor" marketing angle), I think you should probably make a more convincing attempt to better understand the spirit you're succeeding.</p>
<p>Still, bloody gorgeous art. And, look, I'm obviously cherrypicking lines out of context from a single screenshot. I'd be very happy to be eat crow for doubting pigeons here. If not, there's always two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">others</a> anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
