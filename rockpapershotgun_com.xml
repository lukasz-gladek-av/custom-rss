I know we're all about PC games, but none of you will mind if I reminisce about how good PS2 games were, would you? Good, because they were! And <strong>Havenhold</strong>, the debut game from the Beijing based <strong>Wolfpack Games</strong>, looks like it could quite easily be one, even if it has some modern sensibilities in places. You play as a Taichu warrior monk, fighting against other players as you all vye for the top of a special mountain, with the catch being that the game's world completely resets every 14 days.
</p>

<p>
Gameplay wise, it looks to be a pretty solid action game complete with dodging, parrying, elemental abilities. Nothing that necessarily stands out on its own, but it looks pretty tight here as a complete package, and I'm a fan of how your visage transforms depending on the element that you're using. As you try to make your way to the top of the game's main mountain, Kunlun, you'll find dungeons, ruins, temples, that sorta thing, where you can learn new abilities and find blueprints to make gear and weapons.

<p>
For me, the main appeal is in the game's cycle system. I love time-based pressure games like The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unsighted">Unsighted</a>, so to see a game like Havenhold explore that across two weeks feels like a cool concept. 
</p>
<p>
The whole game is PvP generally, but you might be sometimes forced to fight tougher enemies with others, so the whole thing is kind of like one really long Fortnite match you can dip in and out of. I like it! Don't worry though, you keep items and powers over into new cycles, so you don't lose out completely.
</p>
<p>
There's a closed beta test taking place later this month on April 17th too, which you can sign-up to try out through the game's Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015760/Havenhold/">here</a>. It's also planned to launch into early access sometime this year, though no word on when that'll be just yet.

        <p>"We're talking about science fiction at this point"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Much like many of you, I suspect, I too would love a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored</a> 3, but I'm not entirely confident it will ever happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">Arkane Austin was obviously shut down last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-deathloop-team-are-making-a-marvel-blade-game">Arkane Lyon are making a Blade game</a>, which leaves little room for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> sequel. But is there any possibility of one happening all the same? Well, still no, probably, but Arkane Studios founder and Dishonored co-creator Raphaël Colantonio did recently say that he could at the very least see himself working on a follow-up.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While on an episode of the Quad Damage Podcast (thanks for the heads-up, co-host Robert Yapp), Colantonio was asked if he'd have any interested in bringing back working on Humanhead Studio’s version of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. The developer expressed disinterest in working on someone else's games (don't forget Arkane's Prey just uses the name), but he did say this about a potential Dishonored 3: "I'd love to - I mean, we're talking totally hypothetically at this point - I could see myself working on Dishonored 3 right now because it's been so long that, you know, why not?"
</p>

<p>
Like all glimmers of hope, there was a caveat, as he noted "after Dishonored 1, the last thing I wanted to do for the next four years of my life was Dishonored 2. In general I like to create new stuff." 
</p>
<p>
None of this exactly screams Dishonored 3, but Colantonio did also say that both he, fellow Dishonored creator Harvey Smith, and current Arkane head and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> director Dinga Bakaba all have their own documents about their own ideas for a sequel. "I don't think it would make sense to talk about it," Colantonio continued. "Which of those three versions will ever see the day, now we're talking about science fiction at this point. So many of the people [that worked on the series] are scattered around, and Harvey is not at Arkane any more. I'm not at Arkane, and Dinga is working on Blade."
</p>
<p>
So, there you have it. All the people formerly in charge of and currently in charge of Arkane all have ways they could take Dishonored 3, except none of them really have the ability to do it at this point in time. It's a shame Arkane likely won't be working on an original game any time soon, even if Blade looks cool, but I'll still keep my fingers crossed that something fresh - or even a Dishonored sequel - makes its way out eventually.
