            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> mod lets folks load directly into any of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s boss fights from a dedicated menu, essentially turning the game into a choose your own bottom kicking adventure.</p>
<p>After all, who doesn't crave the ability to deliberately battle the one boss they're actually good at beating over and over again, ego juice coursing through their veins, a roar of sheer powerful ecstacy reverberating around their quarters? Or, you know, you might just fancy some practice ahead of your next full run through the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Regardless, the mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/261?tab=description">Godhome</a> by Cuckson, whose name I'm going to try not to read anything into. They've developed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> boss scene loader, which does what it says on the tin, letting you hop into any big baddie scrap the game has to offer at any time.</p>
<p>They claim that your progress shouldn't be affected, but also warned that the work-in-progress mod "could corrupt your save data" and recommend you use a 100%ed save they've included in the zip file. "While this mod is loaded, no data will be saved, to prevent corruption or loss of progress in case of using on a main save," Cuckson continued. "If you would like to enable saving, please first disable or remove this mod from your plugins folder."</p><p>Once the mod's loaded, the B key on your keyboard should open up a dedicated menu of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">different boss fights</a> you can load straight into, from the Savage Beastfly to Chef Lugoli. You'll be dropped at "the closest point to the boss that can be achieved purely through scene loading", which the modder says is often right next to them, and get straight on with the battle. There's also an option from the menu to load up a "safe zone", where you can do a bit of prep or recuperate in between battles.</p>

</figure>
<p>It looks like if you've already completed a run through Skong, you'll essentially be able to live in the boss loader menu, warping around to whichever battle you want to face, which in my book makes this a bit different to the existing teleportation mods for the game. The main ones are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/156?tab=description">Bonfire Teleport</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent, which are more focused around making getting around in a conventional Silksong run a lot more convenient in terms of respawns and fast travelling between the established benches. There's also '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/104">Boss retry menu</a>' from Pilout, which lets you retry a specific boss battle right away if you perish during it.</p>
<p>If you want to give Godhome a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with configuration manager</a> framework or head to <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">GitHub</a> if you're not using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d">64-bit Windows</a>. In other recent Silksong news, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">released its second patch into Steam beta yesterday</a>.</p>

            <p>
Many moons ago, I missed my chance to join a weekly Twilight Imperium play session. Missed my chance, or dodged a bullet? Twilight Imperium is an infamously complicated and backstabby boardgame, the kind of baroque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space opera that can swallow up entire days and expose any number of terrible character flaws along the way.</p>
<p>Thank goodness there's now a PC version in the works for Steam, which will at least remove the need to set up the pieces and remember what they do. Here's a trailer.

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5-TK-5JTm4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
It's being adapted by Red Square Games, the Kraków, Poland-based creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slavicpunk-oldtimer">SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</a>. If you've never come across Twilight Imperium before, the gist is that the galactic emperor has popped their clogs and 17 factions are vying to claim the throne.</p><p>"Will you dominate through raw military might, control the Galactic Council with persuasive politics, or outmaneuver rivals with secret objectives and clever deals?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/">asks the Steam page</a>. Me, I'll be pledging fealty immediately to whoever has possession of planet Crisp Bowl.
</p>
<p>
The Steam version is based on the boardgame's fourth edition, and will feature animated 3D tactical space battles. But the better news, I think, is that there will be interactive tutorials and tooltips. Even better, it also supports singleplayer. I don't envy anybody developing AI leaders for a game like this. The multiplayer features include online matchmaking, hotseat, and asynchronous play.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet. If you can't wait - and your index fingers and eyeballs are up to the strain - you can play Twilight Imperium in Tabletop Simulator. Back in 2015, Paul Dean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tabletop-simulator-mods-copyright">interviewed a bunch of tabletop game creators</a> about how they feel about TTS and its copyright-infringing mods.

            <p>It's been long enough since I last played an Ace Combat game that I can remember only two things about Ace Combat. 1) This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXB1W8va3eg">Ace Combat 7 cutscene</a> featuring what appears to be a wavy JPEG of a dog, which the Twitterati all thought was an exasperated animator's joke, but which I understand is <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Cossette%27s_dog">actually a homage to a real staff member's dog</a> who died before the game's release. And 2) you can 'powerslide' by wilfully initiating a stall, which I think might actually be a move from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-haw-10">Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</a>.</p>
<p>Delivery Must Complete sort of builds a whole subgenre around the thrill of powersliding planes. How does it do this? The clue is that "DMC" is also an abbreviation of "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>". Here's a trailer. I promise you there will be no further confusing/upsetting references to dogs.</p><!--more-->

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/">The Steam page</a> calls it "a high speed Acelike Roguelike with SSSTYLE", featuring cell-shaded, upgradeable jet fighters, four procedural locations, and an enemy roster that includes blimps, dragons and mechs. The story blurb suggests that your overall goal is to make a delivery. What's the return postage cost for an exploded Sidewinder these days?</p><p>In Delivery Must Complete, you will: parry missiles, fire bouncy projectiles out of railguns, deal with varying cloud cover, boggle at fantastical terrain flourishes such as floating islands, build a style meter, and call in orbital strikes. You will not: have limited ammo, though you do have to worry about overheating.

<p>It's the work of Melbourne, Australia-based developer and <a href="https://yoyoyollie.itch.io/">gamejam enthusiast</a> Yoyoyollie. There's no release date yet. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ae2501maeth.bsky.social/post/3lyybxmphtc2o">ae2501maeth</a> for noticing. I've been in the mood for a firmly non-simulatory flight sim for a while and this looks like just the thing, though I do have to flag up its mystifying shortage of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">brewing mechanics</a>.</p>
