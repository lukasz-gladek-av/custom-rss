            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">a full release date</a> during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> last night, along with a fresh trailer. However, there's one detail that might put a bit of a dampener [<em>dhampir</em>? - Ed] on your claret-tinged celebrations about the game finally overcoming its many bloody delays.</p>
<p>You see, while the base version of Bloodlines 2 offers four vampire clans with different playstyles for you to get behind the fangs of, Paradox have opted to stick a further two behind paid day-one DLC.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This pair of clans are the Toreador and the Lasombra, and to get them, you'll need to invest in Bloodlines 2's £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 premium edition, or pay an extra £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 to add the Shadows and Silk DLC pack to your base or deluxe edition. If you opt not to pony up that cash, you will still be able to pick between the Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue clans, but yeah, not ideal.</p>
<p>Especially since both premium clans aren't just swankier looks you'll be able to don. They've each got their own unique abilities, which one has to assume will make a difference to how your playthrough goes and feels. "Embrace the shadows as a Lasombra, commanding the very essence of darkness to bend to your will," reads the Shadows and Silk DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048512/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2__Shadows__Silk/">Steam blurb</a>. "Or, revel in beauty and passion as a Toreador, channeling your artistic spirit to captivate and influence those around you."</p><p>Yep, that's right, the Toreador are otherwise known as the "clan of divas", and are your best shot to play a sexy seducer who probably resembles <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Astarion if he were kicked through the uber-risqué section of a gothic outfitter. Or, to put it another way, Astarion in 90% of modded BG3 playthroughs. The base game's Ventrue also look to have the hobnobbing with high society element to them, but they're a bit more buttoned up. There's more info on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/clans/toreador">Toreador</a> and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/clans/lasombra">Lasombra</a> clans' abilities on Paradox's website.</p>
<p>I've asked Paradox for comment. Charging separately for vampire clans seems a risky decision for a game like Bloodlines 2, which already faces the task of convincing Vampire fans it's worthy of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">spiritual successor label</a>, as well as turning around any cynicism that's understandably crept into folks' minds throughout its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">turbulent development</a>.</p>

I'd entirely forgotten about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a>. I wouldn't say hearing the show's melancholy singsong theme during Gamescom's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-announcements-opening-night-live-2025">Opening Night Live</a> gave me Proustian nostalgia pangs, but it did fill me with a vague desire to look up <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/battlestargalactica-fleetcommander">Gunstar mods for Homeworld</a>.</p>
<p>The game announcement in question was for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a>, a new tactical roguelite from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crying-suns">Crying Suns</a>. Published by Dotemu, it gives you quasi-isometric control of the human armada racing to escape the sinister Cylon fleet. You'll divide your time between managing tensions aboard your ships via branching story beats, assigning limited upgrade resources, flushing out new vessels from the planets you visit, and fending off the perfidious toasters in real-time space combat. Here's a trailer.

It seems pretty standard-issue for a roguelike, and appropriately oppressive. Each run sees you navigating between planets and points of interest that harbour threats and opportunities. Every action you take within systems hastens the arrival of the Cylons. When they show up, you must keep them occupied for long enough to complete calculations for an FTL jump to the next sector. There's a tactical pause to help you plot out manoeuvres. Other enemies may come from within: there are Cylons who can pose as humans, remember. It sort of makes me want to play a Battlestar-flavoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. Doubtless there's a mod for that.
</p><p>
I think Crying Suns has a superior sense of atmosphere. I still find that game's vast bridge viewing port quite magnetic, whereas Scattered Hopes feels more formulaic and Paradoxy in its visual direction. Still, I am always up for some fugitive fleet-building, particularly given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jumplight-odyssey-development-suspended-indefinitely-as-league-of-geeks-face-redundancies">the sad demise of Jumplight Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-last-major-update-adds-superweapons-campaign-interludes-and-a-new-armour-system">the wobbly fortunes of the Homeworld series of late</a>. Battlestar's relatively unglamorous, 'low-tech' ships are fun to think about, versus the borderline magical functionality of the fancier Star Treks.</p>
<p>Scattered Hopes is out Q1 2026 - late winter/early spring. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535950/Battlestar_Galactica_Scattered_Hopes/">Steam</a>. If you think roguelikes are a terrible Cylon perversion, there's also Slitherine's much more Homeworldly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica-deadlock">Battlestar Galactica Deadlock</a> from 2017. Moving away from the strategy genre, I'm chuffed to learn of an ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlespace-freestar-galactica-diaspora">Battlestar mod for Freespace 2</a>.
