            <p>November is...done! The tawdry moveable feast that is Videogaming shudders and rolls beyond the canopy, out into the whitening dunes and fathoms of December. Now for revelry! Strike your trumpets! Blow your drums! Possibly the other way round! The folk of game development exit their wagons and sprint weeping amongst the dissipating trees. A bunch of narrative and game designers put on eight-inch stilettos and form a high-kicking cabaret line. The stilettos fly off and perforate Take-Two's entire executive board. A miracle! Saint CJ be praised! 
</p>
<p>What wonders await us out here in the climactic month of the year? More PC games, apparently. Here are a few that deserve scrutiny, maybe even celebration.
</p>
<h2>Monday 1st December</h2>
<ul>
<li>People keep yelling at me in comments that Dotemu's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> (pictured) is an awesome throwback beat 'em up and we are perfect dunces for ignoring it. Fine, those people. Here's an Official RPS Mention. Now get the hell out of my office.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467850/Wild_Growth/">Wild Growth</a> is an intriguing and snazzily pigmented incremental fantasy strategy game in which you play healer to a Norse warband. I like games that explore the healing profession. I'm not massively into idle clickers, though.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 2nd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tingus-goose">Tingus Goose</a> is that frightful game about goose trees that sprout babies. Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humans-birth-geese-who-birth-mutants-to-pay-for-elaborate-sky-mating-in-tingus-gooses-steam-next-fest-demo">inflicted this on us a few months ago</a>. The very title gives me hives. I'd successfully obliterated it from my memory, but then Julian went and recommended it over Slack this morning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleep-awake">Sleep Awake</a> is the horror game in which people vanish when they sleep, and everybody has accordingly gone nuts for want of shuteye/energy drinks. Wimps! </li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> is Santa Ragione's grotesque psychosexual farming fable inspired by Surrealist film and featuring human slaves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 3rd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2692990/DONT_SCREAM_TOGETHER/">Don't Scream Together</a> is not a polite reminder to only scream by yourself in the privacy of your own home, but a Blair Witchy co-op horror game with mandatory mic usage. Don't talk too loud or you'll become what's chasing you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 4th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3884520/Blood_Refreshed_Supply/">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is Nightdive's revamp of Monolith's 1997 Build engine shooter, featuring 42 levels of demonic mischief, a new scenario, and originally cut features such as weather.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> is a long-in-development sci-fi horror in which you explore a trashed Moonbase from the 1980s. One for the Alien: Isolation and Observation lovers.</li>
<li>Floating city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flotsam">Flotsam</a> leaves early access today. Sim Waterworld, they're calling it, despite the commendable absence of Kevin Costner.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveller 0</a> is a town-building prequel to Square Enix's "HD-2D" throwback RPG that includes stuff from the free-to-play Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 5th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3757210/Agreeee/">Agreeee</a> is about trying to agree to the terms and conditions so that you can play the dang game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also coming this week: some new DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, and Mechwarrior V. Plus: various embargoed things. We are entering the final Events season of the year. The silvery shoals and drifts of December hide many secrets. Like hungry sand fleas, they wriggle towards the footfalls of the game devs carousing on the forest's edge. Eesh! Anyway, let us know if there are any promising new games we're missing.

            <p>So, an ambitious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> multiplayer mod called CyberMP has been in development for a little while now, and the folks behind it have just concluded its "most stable and successful" closed beta test yet. Tweaks to key elements like vehicle and player synchronisation, as well as a new interface and custom lobbies went down well with testers, while technical gremlins were minimal.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about CyberMP, it's a project that's currently being worked on by a team of 10, having first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod-gains-traction-following-successful-playtest">come to prominence</a> last summer. Its goal is to offer multi-person deathmatches and races to Cyberpunkers, rather than full GTA Online-style co-op missioning or gigging.</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the mod's latest closed beta test, which the modders had <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1404067462986731571">previously teased</a> would be a "pivotal stage in the project's evolution". As shown off in the video above, the CyberMP team invited a group to give some races and shootouts a go, as well as cruise around Night City.</p><p>According to the modders' <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1444762474581590148">latest Discord post</a>, the key goals included making sure progress had been made on getting players and vehicles to sync up seamlessly, with the CyberMP folks having reworked both systems. Thankfully, that work's paid off, with characters and cars reportedly translating more smoothly across players' screens, while moving about on foot feels "more responsive".</p>
<p>Also under the microscope were a new interface overlay, which provides everything from chat functions to the ability to teleport around the world, and the option to create custom lobbies for the mod's races and battles. Finally, testing out a new JavaScript module and how CyberMP runs on Linux were on the to-do list. The modders say all went well, adding in terms of those last two technical bits: "several minor bugs that were found have already been fixed, and we will continue working on optimisation".</p>
<p>"In summary, we can confidently say this was the most stable and successful test in the project’s history," the CyberMP team wrote. "Over the few days, only a handful of game client crashes were recorded, some of which were not directly related to the CyberMP client. All discovered gameplay bugs have either already been fixed or are being fixed now. We feel we’re reaching a new level and are preparing for even more extensive changes."</p>
<p>As of writing, the mod's still without a release date, but its creators did tease here that more updates on on the way soon. So, I guess all we can do is keep out weird robo-eyes peeled for news of when multi-merc meetups might open up to everyone.</p>
