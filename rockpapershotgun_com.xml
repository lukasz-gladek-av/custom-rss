While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> is obviously quite busy presumably stressing over lukewarm responses to its next game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, they're still working on a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> stuff. The studio revealed a plethora of expansions today, all of which are building up a new "multi-year saga" called the Fate Saga. We'll get to it in a moment, but one of these expansions might raise an eyebrow, as it is quite literally a Star Wars crossover, but is also described by narrative designer Alison Luhrs as one that will push the Fate Saga "forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come."

Anyway, let's talk about the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIAAxlbFujk&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2">The Edge of Fate</a>. This one's out quite soon, July 15th, where you'll be heading to a planetoid called Kepler to "redefine our future." You'll be facing off against Fallen Corsairs and Vex Kobolds on Kepler, and you can get new abilities by binding your guardian to dark matter. On top of that, there's a bunch of new modifiers, armour is getting an update to include set bonuses and reworked stats, and gear can progress up to five tiers.

Then, there's the second expansion, Renegades. Here you'll find the Star Wars stuff, which includes you rocking a lightsaber, alongside some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJUdSgTuSMs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous cosmetics</a>. Honestly, this one stinks a bit. I'm a bit sick of Star Wars by now, and I already think that Destiny having any crossovers at all ruins the vibe, but for it to be a whole, important expansion that'll inevitably get vaulted? Come off it. If you're not as put off as I am, this one is due out December 2.

After that there's a couple more expansions to come too, one called Shattered Cycle out summer 2026, and the other being The Alchemist in winter 2026. You might notice that that's two expansions a year, which certainly is a lot, but there's big questions as to whether that'll be enough to bring people back.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has struggled quite a bit in recent years, not to mention the fact that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">down by a lot of staff</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">couple of years ago</a>, so this certainly feels like a push to get back on track. Fingers crossed for the team more than anything else.
