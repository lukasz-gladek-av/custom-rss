            <p>I wake up at 3AM. Do 50 pull-ups on a halberd wedged in the door frame. Do 50 push-ups on the cold stone floor. A servant hands me my protein mead and a wine frappamachiato. I violently double fist the two beverages. I don't eat breakfast, because food that isn't flavourless cup gruel is the enemy of productivity. Then, I'm dressed in my robes for the commute to the throne room. The magic starts. It's 5AM in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and I'm on my medieval monarch grindset.</p>
<p>I pull out Paradox's <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-192-spring-cleaning.1902372/">latest dev diary</a>. Oh, look at that, they're working with a mystery modder on bringing exactly the sort of big number tables to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> that I need to tell at a glance whether I'm out-grinding my inbred wealth-creating cousins who rule other nations across the world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These big number tables are dubbed The Ledger, and once added to CK3 as part of the game's next major update, they'll give you a big spreadsheet to delve into if you're keen to look up certain aspects of your kingverse. For example, you can quickly check which ruler across the world has the most gold without having to click on them all, or see which of the current crop of wars has been running the longest.</p>
<p>Handy, and according to Paradox design manager Riad Deneche it's the product of some direct collaboration between the studio and a mystery modder whose identity will be revealed in a future dev blog. "Much of their work had already inspired us internally and influenced changes we’d made to the game," the developer wrote. "When I reached out, instead of assigning a predefined task, I asked a simple question: what would you like to work on? They came back with a list so large it genuinely shocked the team. Some of it overlapped with things already in our pipeline, but a lot of it made us collectively ask, 'How did we not think of this?'"</p><p>The Ledger was one of those ideas, and the initial version of it's set to include tabs covering characters, artifacts, ongoing Wars, and houses. All things you might want to sort through, compare or just check up on if you're loading up a save you've put a lot of hours into for the first time in a while. I can't say I've been playing CK3 long enough to have any properly ancient games to return to, but even a couple of weeks gap between checking on my weird Scottish co-monarchy can leave me struggling to remember off the top of my head what's going on.</p>
<p>The likes of counties, titles, holdings, faiths and cultures are also being considered for tabs of their own, and Deneche points out that modders will likely come up with ones the developers don't think to add. Quite frankly, I'll be happy if I can sort monarchs by their percentage of inbredness or courtiers by how much they hate me.</p>
<p>The update that'll bring the ledger and a number of other quality-of-life additions/fixes is currently slated to arrive at the start of Q2, which if my understanding of corporatese is right will put it around the beginning of April.</p>
