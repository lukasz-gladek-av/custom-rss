        <p>Following a tumultuous year for workers at the French studio</p>

            <p>French studio Don't Nod have laid off workers across multiple departments. The full number is unconfirmed, but multiple affected staff have posted about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshv5ffj6c22/quotes">their departures on LinkedIn</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> principal cinematic artist Mary Pouliot, technical artist Laurent Dufrense, and QA lead Sandra Cormier.</p>
<p>It's been a rocky year or so for Don't Nod's staff. Last September, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">paused two unannounced games</a> and said they're altering others, also unannounced, to be more appealing to a "wider audience", following warnings about an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. Chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert attributed this to (the excellent) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden</a> performing "well below expectations" commercially.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Back in February of the same year, French union STJV alleged mismanagement at Don't Nod, including "contradictory" directions, shifting deadlines, and "no long-term vision" for staff welfare (cheers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">Eurogamer</a>). Following September's statements from Guilbert, the STJV published another statement of their own, accusing Don't Nod of creating "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leadership-at-dont-nod-are-creating-an-atmosphere-of-extreme-violence-with-planned-layoffs-says-french-game-workers-union">an atmosphere of extreme violence</a>” with planned layoffs and mistreatment of staff.</p>
<p>(I figure it's worth nothing here, re: the perhaps contentious use of the term "violence" that a.) French works differently to English and b.) the damage caused by extreme stress brought about from job precarity can obviously be genuinely physically harmful. Living under the protective shroud of being one degree of removal and deniability from the most literal definition of violence is how some of the worst people on the planet continue to be allowed to show their horrible little faces in public, after all.)</p>
<p>Sorry about that, had brief <em>commie flush</em>. Must be the weather. Ahem. "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months", said the STJV at the time, saying that around 29% of the Paris studio's workforce could be at risk of losing their jobs. This coincided with another statement from Guilbert saying Don't Nod would be undergoing a "reorganisation project". Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">an IGN report</a>, Don't Nod announced they were expecting to lay off employees at this time.</p>
<p>The numbers get a little bit hard to track from that point. In a <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2025/04/08/don_t-nod-provides-an-update-on-its-strategy-implementation-to-adapt-to-new-market-conditions">strategy document</a> from April of this year, Don't Nod said that "ultimately, 59 job cuts are planned, including 12 departures that have not been replaced since the announcement". Last month, STJV <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/05/looking-back-on-the-fight-against-layoffs-at-dont-nods/">announced</a> that they'd "secured 23 voluntary redundancies for job categories not threatened by the plan, in order to save as many colleagues from being fired", as well as securing severance and strike pay. "Instead of the 69 layoffs initially planned, there were 46 voluntary departures and 1 layoff," STJV write (Thanks, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/543386/article/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-studio-dont-nod-montreal-has-2nd-round-of-layoffs-after-union-intervened-the-1st-time/">Gameranx</a>).</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current round of layoffs. The STJV have yet to comment publicly. I've reached out to them, as well as Don't Nod to confirm the number of layoffs at the studio, and I'll update this if and when I know. Best of luck to all affected. Again, Jusant was bloody brilliant.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Boy, that escalated quickly. Less than a day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s PvE patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">went into public testing</a>, changes that turn the "entire southern half" of the Deep Desert into a PvE area have been hotfixed into the full game.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">promised change</a> arrives alongside the first of the scout ornithopter balancing tweaks Funcom talked about in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">recent AMA</a>, and a couple of other fixes. However, there's a bunch of stuff put into testing yesterday which hasn't yet made the jump to public release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546739082808525243?l=english">hotfix 1.1.0.17</a>, the biggest thing it does is change the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> so that the entire southern half of it is made up of PvE areas - a pretty hefty scaling back of the PvP zones it comprised on release. This is in line with what creative director Joel Bylos said in a recent post addressing PvE and PvP concerns.</p>
<p>To ensure the area retains plenty of "Risk vs Reward" for competitive players, the PvP-filled northern part of it contains the densest deposits of valuable resources, the largest spice fields, and most of the control points.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The servers are now coming back online and patch notes for 1.1.0.17 are available.<br>We have some changes following the message from our Creative Director in this one!<a href="https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7">https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7</a><br>Remember to restart your Steam client if the download does not appear! <a href="https://t.co/1WP0uBv2mk">pic.twitter.com/1WP0uBv2mk</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1938151078337376594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Funcom have made some further balancing tweaks in light of the change, writing: "The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a 'first come, first served' basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest."</p>
<p>If you want to max out the number of schemactics you grab each week, you'll also need to visit Imperial Testing Stations in both PvE and PvP areas. If you're a bit taken aback by how quickly these changes have jumped from testing into the full game, like some players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lkui75/11017_patch_notes/">Reddit</a> and Discord, Funcom have made clear they'll make further adjustments based on player feedback if needs be. By putting these changes live for everyone, they're bound to get plenty.</p>
<p>Outside of that, the devs have started making tweaks to balance Ornithopters with this hotfix. Equipping a rocket launcher to your bird will now slow it down by 20% if it's a Scout Ornithopter, and 10% if it's an Assault one.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how this pretty huge shift in DA's endgame area plays out. It's proven pretty polarising so far, so it'll be interesting to see whether folks come around to it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game]]></content:encoded>
