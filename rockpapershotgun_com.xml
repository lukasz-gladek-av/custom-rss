Gosh, can you believe it? It's already the 35th anniversary of Ruin! It came out before I was born, but even I'm feeling the passage of time with this one. With such a momentous occasion upon us, a special 35th anniversary edition of the legendary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has been released by its developer Official Electric, split across just four floppy disks… except, well, you've definitely already clocked that Ruin isn't quite real. At least not in the way it's been presented.
</p>
<p>
The actual game in question here is Ruin: Chapter 0, an interactive fiction game in the stylings of something you might have seen on the ZX Spectrum, albeit with a lot more flair. And, perhaps, a lot more glitches - <strong>a big flashing imagery warning is needed for this one</strong>. Playable within your browser, it's kind of hard to describe what you do, or even what you're doing, in Ruin. From what I can gather, you are a knight, the hero of rune, tasked by the king to retrieve a sword and defeat evil forever. But no matter what, I just keep getting my ass kicked by this evil, and every time I die it just says "get owned" at me! Rude!
</p>

<p>
And then the game becomes something else… a sci-fi romper across different planets, one where you run through the woods clicking on apples at just the right time as they approach you, and where you take pitstops to take a smoke break. Those moments where you take the devil sticks out of their luxurious boxes requires you to actually do so, dragging it out, flicking your lighter to set it off, pulling it towards your lips. It is such a strangely involved game in some ways, and hands-off in others.
</p><p>
It flicks between your more typical RPG kind of screen, to a first-person point-and-click adventure game, to, quite honestly, an animated movie of sorts. There is an impenetrable quality to it that makes me want to break it down, to uncover its secrets, to do a deep dive on Wikipedia followed by watching several "Ruin EXPLAINED" videos on YouTube. And yet I won't find those, because Ruin is not the legendary IP celebrating its 35th anniversary it claims to be. But it does a good job of making you believe in it.

            <p>
Let's get something real clear here right off the bat: I couldn't possibly tell you if Team Cherry are planning to make any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> games. That isn't to say there isn't more Hollow Knight on the way, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be getting… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">something</a>, at some point, in the future. However! Studio heads William Pellen and Ari Gibson have at least floated a hypothetical idea around how the world of Hollow Knight might get bigger.
</p>
<p>
Remember when ACMI (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) put on a little exhibition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">where there was a playable demo for Silksong</a> earlier this year? Well, as shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar</a>, that same exhibition came with a <a href="https://shop.acmi.net.au/collections/frontpage/products/acmi-guide-hollow-knight-silk-song-softcover">little guidebook</a> filled with concept art, maps, as well as an interview with Team Cherry.
</p>
<p>
Pellen and Gibson were asked by co-curator of the exhibition Jini Maxwell how they might define success for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, both noting that "releasing it with no major bugs" would be a good start. "The 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," Pellen explained. "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."
</p>
<p>
Gibson added on to that saying that said goal was to make Silksong a "game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight," one that "kind of branches off in a nice way; I think they really complement each other." Here's where the interesting bit comes in from Gibson: "I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong. And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern - that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."
</p><p>
Ahah! There it is! The quote that will convince the masses that more Hollow Knight games are in the works. Of course, again, there's no way of knowing this. Still, this comment reassures me. I'm glad that Silksong is mostly a self-contained experience separate from the original Hollow Knight, and if this world has to be explored again, it should once more do its own thing. Wouldn't mind it if Sherma showed up elsewhere, though.
