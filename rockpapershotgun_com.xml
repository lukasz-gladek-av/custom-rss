            <p>
I've had my eye on Mightreya since long before it had its name, when it was just clips of a somewhat generic anime girl doing sick tricks and beatdowns in levels without assets. But now it looks like a genuine (the -uine pronounced like wine, so you've got the right intonation) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> video game, with a slightly less generic looking anime girl continuing to do sick tricks and beatdowns, albeit with a bit more context. And you can even try it out for yourself now with a new demo! Which I did and will tell you about thusly.
</p>
<p>
When I first saw Mightreya (which I oh so desperately wish was called Mightyreya because I keep accidentally typing it that way), I thought it was something in the vein of Gravity Rush. This is an instant boon for me as a lover of the PlayStation's most underrated series with the most juice around, and while you won't be shifting any gravity in Mightreya, there are still qualities to be found there, it's more just that you fly around the place.

<p>
The character in question doing the flying around is the titular Reya, a highschooler who is essentially a superhero livestreamer, with her pink haired, camera toting manager Nio following her around filming everything she (or more accurately, you) get up to. Said livestream is even punctuated by showing up in the top right hand corner, which is perhaps a little distracting, but still a cute touch.
</p><p>
This is a world filled with kaiju, that you have to beat up in bombastic and flashy ways. Here is where you'll find some strong <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> elements, complete with a combo ranking system that encourages you to mix up your moves to better entertain your audience. Everything feels nice and crunchy, the hits are impactful, the dodge windows are precise but approachable, you certainly get some of that superhero flair while fighting.
</p>
<p>
It is also a lot to get used to. Pretty much every button in your controller (it recommends a controller upon booting it up, sorry) is utilised and it took me a while to memorise what everything did. Not a Sisyphean task by any means, you might just need to prepare yourself for an adjustment period. The combo sickos will certainly find something to click with here at the very least.
</p>
<p>
I obviously can't speak to how the story will shake out, this is just a demo after all, and honestly the vague anime-inspired vibe may be understandably offputting for some. Still, worth a shake if you're in need of something to tide you over until Capcom figures out how to make another DmC! You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077640/MIGHTREYA/">here</a>.

            <p>
When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnos">Hypnos</a> upon its announcement last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-have-no-idea-what-you-do-in-hypnos-but-its-cosmic-horror-megastructure-world-looks-so-pretty-im-not-bothered">I noted how I don't really know what you do in it</a>. The trailer was entirely about The Vibes, but that was enough for my mechanically minimalist loving heart. I've now had a go at the demo, and to tell you the truth, I'm still not entirely sure what you do, and I couldn't give a monkeys because oh me oh my, what a pretty world it does contain.
</p>
<p>
Here are the things I do know: you play as the very handsome Choron, a "vagabond burdened by his past" who is searching for a "faceless boy who haunts his dreams." You are in a strange dreamscape filled with impossibly large, almost pristinely white structures that sit atop a holy mountain called Kadath, where pilgrims make their journey towards.

<p>
In the demo, which covers what I think is roughly the first hour of the game, you meet some of these pilgrims, all of which are an odd sort, speaking occasionally in riddles to my mind. Though, I suspect this is because they have an understanding of the world that I don't, and will need to play the game to find out.
</p><p>
For the most part, Hypnos comes across as something of a walking simulator stroke visual novel. There are occasionally dialogue options, like in one instance where a pilgrim is being harassed by some mean-looking folks, and you can try to negotiate, or blast the head of one of the baddies to high heaven with a gun that could easily have come from Blame! (a fellow world filled with megastructures). The consequences of such decisions aren't immediately apparent, but this is a demo, I'll forgive it for not answering my queries right away.
</p>
<p>
The lack of explicit mechanics may put off some (there is some sort of teleporting thing you can do at certain points, but not whenever you like), but for my own tastes I am quite happy to just keep wondering around this mysterious land where people can seemingly turn into pigs that quibble over sharing some crumbs. Everything within your vision is just so unfathomably large, begging the question of who built such things, and for what purpose. The visual novel-esque cutscenes contain designs that can easily sit up in the pantheon Hades' do too, Hypnos simply drips with confidence in its design sensibilities.
</p>
<p>
And throughout it all, I still haven't the foggiest as to what's going on! So I will have to come back to the full thing whenever it releases. For now, you could try out its demo or wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861210/HYPNOS/">here</a>.

            <p>
A few years ago, it's entirely possible that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> isn't the current talk of a town called Didn't Work. But now, when everyone wants a piece of the live service pie, it's not so easy to come in and claim some for yourself. We could spend an eternity figuring out what went wrong, but perhaps the words of former senior level designer on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> Alex Graner will provide a particular insight that the comment section of an annoying YouTuber won't.
</p>
<p>
Graner recently made an appearance on the Quad Damage podcast (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGamesN</a>), where he explained that when he joined developed Wildlight, they were "trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries. You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player."
</p>

</a>

<p>
Graner specifically said he felt that the game "leaned too far into the competitive scene," particularly when development shifted the game towards a 3v3 format. "3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it. It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."
</p><p>
He did, of course, point to that "spotlight" placed upon it at Geoff's Night of Statues and Trailers, adding a lot more pressure for it to do well. But, Graner notes, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came out at a time where battle royales were still fresh and new, Highguard instead arrived with some tough to learn rules and a high skill floor. "If you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game… I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."
</p>
<p>
Quite honestly, I think Graner is at least partially correct here. I haven't bothered with Highguard myself, just not my vibe, but the little I've experimented with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has me feeling similarly. I'm just not good at shooters and people are ruthless! In any case, the 3v3 mode certainly isn't the only problem, as based on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-went-wrong-with-highguard-the-hubris-of-its-developers-leadership-say-former-staff-in-a-new-report">recent report</a>, it sounds like leadership needs to shoulder a heavy load of the blame too.

            <p>
Last year, Owlcat announced they were working on another CRPG set within the world of Warhammer 40,000 called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Dark Heresy</a>. This would have potentially led to an assumption that they were done with their previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, but nope! They're still going, and a brief teaser for that CRPG's next bit of DLC was shared (and when I say brief, I do mean it), and to wet your appetite, some gameplay for Dark Heresy is there to have a look at too.
</p>
<p>
The DLC is titled The Infinite Museion (how often do you think that's going to get autocorrected to Museum, wasting the time of Warhammerers everywhere), and it's all about investigating the secret vault of one Trazyn the Infinite. Now, I know diddly squat about Warhammer lore, but a name like that certainly has a foreboding atmosphere about it.

"Discover Trazyn’s obsession with the Von Valancius dynasty, and choose whether to disrupt or fulfill his plans," reads the DLC's description on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4226770/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__The_Infinite_Museion/">Steam</a>. "Explore a glimpse of his fabled collection, claim priceless relics, and face off against guardians that defy understanding. A new companion joins your retinue with a distinct combat style that reshapes battlefield tactics. This expansion brings a new questline, a new mechanic - implants - that can be used strategically in battle, and a deeper dive into Necron conflicts."

There's no release date attached to this one, however, not even for this year, so you'll have to hold out for now. However, the gameplay for Dark Heresy has a bit more meat on its bones, though only a bit. Mostly it shows off the middle of a battle between your party of characters and some nasty baddies, offering a glimpse of the kind of actions and strategies you can take. Hard to glean how fun it is from such a brief look, and it's only alpha gameplay, but it's better than nowt! No release date here either, so, wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">here</a> I suppose?
