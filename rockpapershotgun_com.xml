The Six One Indie Showcase is a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to video game presentations, but it's certainly working hard to justify itself. Early today the latest showcase was held showing off a huge range of indies, 48 in total, some of them being brand new reveals, others smaller showcases. 
</p>

<p>
There's honestly too many showcases around these days, to see a show with a lot of games that made me go "oh I'm going to put that on my wishlist" is a treat. So, here's just a few I think you should check out, because I'm just one freelancer on the night shift and I can't do them all, but I'd like you to take a look anyway.
</p>
<p>
First up was a proper reveal of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3239830">Truth Scrapper</a>, the next games from the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-stars-and-time">In Stars and Time</a>. This one's a scrapbooking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> where your memories reset every day, but there's a mystery that you need to solve. Did I mention there's toxic lesbians? Instant winner.

<p>
I've had my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/">Artis Impact</a> for a little while now, an incredibly stylish pixelart turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a world overrun by AI. Sounds a bit too relatable right now, but I'm still in.

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1141260/1000_Deaths_Thousand_Deaths/">1000 Deaths</a> is a "gravity-bending 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> where your choices matter", and also a game that looks like graphics card box art from the '90s and 2000s. To be clear, this is the highest of compliments I can hand out.

Okay, this one isn't a game per se, but it does also involve the number 1000. Last year's seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.veryokvinyl.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3PvLKTRCWUK91CwpewlE4CQNnP7ZMmMReUMB9c6eXcMP0Ktst">ridiculously gorgeous looking vinyl</a> set that comes in two versions - one with one set of sisters, one with another. The recent fanzine for the game (which you can download for free on <a href="https://0x0ada.itch.io/blue-communion">itch.io</a>) is getting a physical edition too!

<p>
Then we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3414580/Forbidden_Solitaire/">Forbidden Solitaire</a>, a "card-slashing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about unearthing the contents of a cryptic 1995 CD-ROM that should have never existed." This one's for the card game weirdos (I am card game weirdos).

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946390/Jump_the_Track/">Jump the Track</a> mixes choice based visual novels with pachinko, following an ambitious slacker called Sam who doesn't understand why we're supposed to spend our lives working awful jobs while the rich get to live it up.

<p>
I think you just need to watch the trailer for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/">GlitchSPANKR</a>, I think any approach I take to explaining it will get it wrong.

<p>
And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2681870/Kidbash_Super_Legend/">Kidbash: Super Legend</a>, a very charming and nostalgic-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action-platformer set in a "world of forgotten game characters as a hero with no memory of his past."

The Six One Indie Showcase really did just have what looked like banger after banger, it'll be worth your time to go and <a href="https://youtu.be/adI4uizTYN4?si=VLceKYiRPwY-JyPj">watch the full thing</a> and get wishlisting anything else that catches your eye.

            <p>
As much as I'm up for trying a new one whenever one arrives, I'm not particularly good at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>. It just gets too sweaty for me, I prefer a good single-player shooter above all else because I can actually take down my opponents without the fear of embarrassing myself somehow. And yet here we are again, with the open beta for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, which started earlier today, leaving me thinking "well, I could give it a go I suppose."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I haven't actually had a go yet because, well, I'm a bit busy letting you all know that you can go and play it, and what it contains. Gotta earn a living somehow. Anyway, there's a lot! The biggest thing is The Lab, which is essentially its new map creator that was teased in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-is-almost-ready-for-you-try-it-out-as-the-portal-with-actual-guns-shooter-sets-a-date-for-its-open-beta">initial open beta trailer</a>. This pretty much does what it says on the tin, i.e. you can build your own maps and game modes. Pretty great fit for a game that combines Halo and Portal!

<p>
Then there's the return of Takedown, a team-based mode where if you kill an opponent your team's respawns are shorter, but if you get killed your respawns take longer. If you manage to down every enemy at the same time, you win! Stadium 2.0, a rework of the map from the original game, arrives with the beta too. There's also new 24-player onslaught maps, for those that like a bit more chaos. 
</p>
<p>
Hunt the Devs will also be returning from the open alpha, which isn't a mode so much as an achievement to set out. If you find a 1047 dev wearing a special flaming disco ball skin, you'll get a Dev Killer skin for the faction they're playing in return.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> say that "one more massive surprise" is yet to be shown off, planned to be revealed whenever the game enters 1.0. There's no date set for that just yet, but player progression will continue on to the full game, so don't feel like you have to wait around for it. To sign-up to the beta, all you need to do is head to the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/">game's official website</a>, and pick your platform of choice. Easy peasy!
