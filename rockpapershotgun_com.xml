            <p>
Jagex have announced RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> co-operative survival game set in the same fantasy realm as their ancient MMO. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, looks a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>, and will launch into early access this spring. Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall, a wilderness abundant in winged lizards, and your overall goal is to "slay the Dragon Queen". 
</p>
<p>
I'm going to make the obvious prediction here: you will spend much more time in Ashenfall chopping down trees and composing their delicious, grainy innards into barn doors than chopping down any dragons, regal or otherwise. It's a survival game, after all. The ratio of dragons to logging and carpentry in the first screenshots is a nail-biting 1:1 - if it weren't for that subtitle, I might have assumed this to be a game about woodlands management with optional Smaug-bashing QTEs.</p><p>Rather than dragon-felling cantrips, the announcement release gives prominent mention to a spell for summoning spectral axes to chop trees down for you, which feels a bit like a car salesman leading with the option to just buy a train ticket instead. Still, let's not be <em>entirely</em> miserable before we've even played the game. Here's the announcement trailer.

The game is said to blend "high fantasy with light RPG elements and iconic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> lore." You will "reshape your experience" by means of a magical power called Anima. "Summon spectral axes to fell trees in an instant or channel nature's energy to repair broken armour," the press release explains. Got you: automatable tasks and an equipment degradation system.</p>
<p>There's a progression system with new spells, crafting recipes and abilities to obtain. You'll be able to gad about in groups of four, fighting creatures you might recognise from regular ole RuneScape. And also, massacring the vegetation. Have at you, timber!

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">Read more on Steam</a>. I've never played the original RuneScape or its more recent free-to-play version, which yet graces our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">best MMOs and MMORPGs</a>. As such, I'm not really equipped to comment on whether Dragonwilds is a blasphemy unto RuneScaping or a promising fresh start fuelled by a finely calibrated mix of nostalgia and approachability. But I do know that it takes a lot to get me enthusiastic about a fantasy survival game right now. Still, I like the colourfulness of this, and I strongly relate to the expression of unholy joy on the face of the character in the picture there, as she unleashes the full force of the occult upon an unsuspecting sycamore.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ahead of this Friday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">big content update</a> for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Capcom have put out a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">new blog from director Yuya Tokuda</a>, detailing more scaly, slimy, and shiny additions. The main theme here is "harder fights", with arch-tempered variants of monsters besides the announced Ray Dau. But there's plenty of other planned smaller tweaks and goodies, including a reduction in VRAM usage coming "very soon".</p>
<p>Friday's update includes long n' purple Mizutsune, plus repeatable fights with Zoh Shia, previously a one-off story monster. There's also a new gathering hub, which I'm especially happy about - I miss what I once referred to as "Astera's gung-ho trumpetbastardry". I want to see people and I want to see lights, and I also want to see virtuosic cat chefs.</p>

<p>That's all ancient soup though, so what's new? First, there's seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance starting April 22nd. These are limited events that offer new cosmetic gear, gestures, and decorations, with the titular blossoms being a theme this go around. April 30th brings a limited time arch-tempered Ray Dau event, with a permanent free hunt from May 7th. At least, this is what the text says, the image above seems to contradict that. Either way, arch-tempered Raymond is on the way.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of May, there's a 'Capcom collaboration', plus additional features. Monster Hunter World featured a Dante (from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> series) set, so I'm assuming it's something similar. I'll avoid any easy wanking jokes about Capcom 'collaborating' with itself, obviously.  Finally, there's another big update due sometime in Summer, fonted as such to suggest a similar sized offering to Friday's monst drop.</p>
<p>Tokuda then goes into details about future plans. First up: more 8 Star Tempered Monst in the vein of Tempered Arkveld, with Tempered Mizutsune being the first. "In addition, the update at the end of May will add the Tempered Monsters (â˜…8) Gore Magala and the apex predators of each locale: Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad," say Capcom.</p>
<p>Next, there's balance adjustments across the board, with hammer buffs and corruption mantle nerfs mentioned specifically. There's some quality of life bits mentioned, specifically "the ease of restocking items, checking skill information, participating in multiplayer quests and using the Seikret; and camera behaviour during hunts". A bit later on, there's also the mention of layered weapons, endemic life previews, and "a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas".</p>
<p>In terms of PC performance, Capcom say the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues.</p>
<p>Improvements coming very soon include a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version in Free Title Update 1. These should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jubilant news indeed. If you're still having issues with performance and/or general ugliness, I found that the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93">REFramework</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/245">Disable Lens Distortion</a> mods work wonders, although official improvements are obviously welcome. Now give me an Arch Tempered Greater Jagras. He deserves revenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
