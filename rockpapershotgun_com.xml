            <p>
Anyone that's ever been on the London underground, no matter their background, can all likely agree on one thing: that place is nasty. I mean, it's all underground, where's the dirt meant to go? And it's not like anyone's putting any money into getting the place cleaned. But, if you've ever fantasized about hosing down a Northern Line train for yourself, one, that's possibly slightly odd, and two, you'll be able to do almost just that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator's</a> next and last update.

Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/futurlab">FuturLab</a> shared an <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">update earlier today</a> saying that "the time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator." Four years on since the game launch into early access in 2021, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">cleaning sim</a> will be getting an update titled The Muckingham Files 6 where you'll be able to clean up a legally safe version of a London underground train, as well as a nice looking park with a big gnome statue, amongst others.

The update is already available too, and it's completely free, so you'll just need to update your game when you're feeling the need to clean.

<p>
If you're wondering, "wait, last update? Why?", I would like to say that it's okay when things end sometimes, but also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-devs-tell-us-their-tips-for-real-life-house-cleaning">PowerWash Simulator 2 was announced a couple of months ago</a>, so that'll be why the first one is winding down. The sequel is set to arrive sometime in 2025, as long as all goes to plan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-has-split-screen-co-op-for-twice-the-wash-power">and it'll even have splitscreen co-op</a>. FuturLab are also self-publishing this one, so unfortunately you probably won't be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulators-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-pack-is-out-now">give Cloud's sword a good polish this time around</a>.
