            <p>The future of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> series will see multiplayer bits pushed "more predominantly", according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. The exec said this thing on stage at a conference in Saudi Arabia last month (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>), around the same time he announced the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC the company have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">partnered with the Saudi government on</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked about the future of the series that brought us that one scene where the pirate guy talks about the definition of insanity before kicking you into a big hole, Guillemot said that the publishers' goal "on Far Cry [is] really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed, so that it can also be played for a long time by players."</p>
<p>Yves, believe me, you can play a single player game for a very long time. His comments come a couple of years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-working-on-far-cry-7-and-separate-far-cry-multiplayer-spin-off-game-says-report">reports claiming</a> that Ubisoft were working on both the next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-7">Far Cry 7</a>, and a multiplayer-only spin-off. Kotaku's report at that point alleged Far Cry 7 will see the series move on from the Dunia engine, in use since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a>. The muliplayer game was claimed by Insider Gaming to be an extraction shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness.</p>
<p>While Far Cry's always been more of a single-player romp of explosions and bullets for me, though the last couple of entries have obviously featured plenty of co-op in addition to traditional online multiplayer. I can't recall the matches and modes themselves being anything exceptional, if still fun. However, the map editors they came with were brilliant if, like me, you were a 15-year-old who liked building houses and hideouts, but reckoned getting really into Minecraft would be the final nail in your secondary school cool factor coffin.</p><p>Then again, maybe I'm not the person to ask given I've still not given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> a go, despite having played every other entry since 2. I just keep forgetting 6 exists, then remembering, reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/far-cry-6-review">reviews</a>, and concluding that it's probably not worth it until the next sale, by which point I've forgotten again. Far Cries 2 and 3 were the shooter's peak in my book, at their best when you were setting half of Africa on fire just to kill three guys or blowing an outpost into the sea. My dad, meanwhile, swears by the original and caveperson spin-off Primal.</p>
<p>I'd interrupt his latest Horizon: Zero Dawn playthrough to ask if he'd care about a multiplayer-only Far Cry, but I think I know what the answer'd be.</p>

            <p>Where do you go after making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">Dorfromantik</a>, the 14th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle game</a> on PC? Unto infinity, chick. Unto infinity, and all the uranium-packed celestial masses it contains. Berlin-based Toukana Interactive are back with Star Birds - another “soft strategy” sim and laidback resource management game, in which you take charge of an avian asteroid-mining operation. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The just-released early access build endeared itself to me instantly by having my bird captain quack like an Apple Macintosh, then sealed the deal with a procession of delightfully rotatable space boulders, some of which look like spangly Easter eggs and some of which look like handfuls of Emmental. Don’t call this a review, mind – I’ve barely played an hour, and the game won’t leave early access until at least this time next year – but I get the feeling Toukana are onto a good thing here. Another nice flourish: optional supply quests are presented as little dovecot windows from which a feathery Wesley Crusher peeks forth, waiting for you to accept their errand.

<p>An overview: Star Birds is broken into missions narrated by a cast of wisecracking astral warblers. The abundance of text dialogue is slightly stifling, for a puzzle game, but I suspect it’ll taper off beyond the initial tutorial sections. Each mission sees you parking your mothership next to a new asteroid field, and zooming on individual asteroids to build things and set up a production network. It starts with you socketing a launchpad into a crater, placing excavators on resource fields, and linking them to your launchpad with pipes to shuttle resources back to the mothership. 
</p><p>As the levels and story progress, you unlock and research new facilities, including chem labs that combine two kinds of resource into one. You’ll rarely find every resource you need for the quest at hand on any one asteroid. So you must build landing sites for rockets, and start moving resources between asteroids. All of this proceeds at a leisurely pace: no hazards, no mission timer.
</p>
<p>The UI consists of phat, pastel, pressable buttons that are begging for a touchscreen port. Pretty much every action is performed with the mouse. It feels like they’re treading a delicate line between efficiency and whimsy in terms of the controls, I must admit. I can imagine being annoyed by the act of dragging out snarls of pipework between structures, in a game with more threat or urgency, particularly because pipes can’t overlap. You'll probably have to go back and unravel them, whenever you need to alter the layout of your roids.
</p>
<p>In the context, though, I find the slight tangliness attractive. This is a factory sim that also wants to be a toy, and has so far stuck the landing. If you’re short of credits for construction, you can also pop down a buggy and drag out a path for it between piecemeal gold outcrops.
</p>
<p>I suspect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> players might find Star Birds too fussy, next to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">bucolic immediacy</a> of popping down six-sided tiles, but people who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> and have at least a tolerance for ornithology puns should enjoy this. As may people who liked the vibe of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, at the risk of setting a roguelike amongst the pigeons. You can find Star Birds on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Steam</a>.</p>
