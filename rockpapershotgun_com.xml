            <p>The next big update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Shadow and Order, has been delayed as it undergoes a substantial round of tweakage and expansion.

Former staff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games have revealed to RPS that they’re owed months of unpaid salary, following layoffs at the company last year. They've shared an inside look at a troubled independent studio dealing with payment delays, multiple changes of direction, and general confusion that stretches back to spring 2025.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded in September 2019, Jyamma are one of Italy’s better-known indies. Based in Milan, they worked on several mobile games before breaking into PC and console development with Enotria, released in September 2024. We liked Enotria, a sunny and theatrical action-RPG with a distinct vocabulary of elements and status effects, set in a world of gorgeously distorted Italian folklore. RPS reviewer Caelyn Ellis <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review">deemed it</a> “a delightful Soulslike palette cleanser to chase down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> with”. 
</p>
<p>
According to former workers who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, Jyamma were working on a sequel to The Last Song when the salary payment delays began over March and April 2025. At the time, staff were told the situation would be resolved quickly. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
In April, however, CEO Giacomo Greco put the Enotria sequel on hold. Instead, he announced plans for a trading card game adaptation of Dante Alighieri’s epic poem La Divina Comedia, aka The Divine Comedy - an exciting prospect, following Enotria’s explorations of Italian art and culture. Then, in May, Greco revealed to the rest of the studio in an email that Jyamma was experiencing financial difficulties, and would not be able to proceed with scheduled payments.
</p><p>
In a copy of the email to staff, shared with RPS, Greco attributed Jyamma’s cashflow problems to delayed collection of revenue from sales of Enotria on PlayStation across February, March and April. The company had already faced challenges bringing the game to Xbox Series X and S versions, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/souslike-enotria-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-because-microsoft-decided-to-ignore-devs">promising</a> to "improve our processes" after Greco criticised them on Jyamma’s Discord.
</p>
<p>
The May email to staff stresses that "these issues are specifically related to the last couple of months," and mentions a forthcoming injection of cash from a government tax credit "within a couple of months." There is also talk of "several initiatives to attract private investments through a dedicated platform, which will allow us to diversify our funding sources and ensure greater long-term stability."
</p>

</figure>
<p>
According to a copy of another email shared with us, this time written by administrative manager Anastasia Tsybakova on June 13th, outstanding payments for April had been "fully paid." But sources tell me that Jyamma management repeatedly postponed monthly payments through to August 2025, with one person commenting that "communication became inconsistent and unclear."
</p><p>
According to my sources, Greco announced another massive change of direction in July: the Divine Comedy adaptation would now be an action-RPG, like Enotria. Greco also told staff that Jyamma were in talks with Neowiz about potential funding. In another email sent to staff in July, he wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> publishers had "expressed strong interest" in publishing either the Divine Comedy adaptation or Enotria 2, with "concrete updates" expected by September or October. 
</p>
<p>
The email also mentions discussions with investors about taking Jyamma public on the NASDAQ stock exchange – "a complex process that could take 6-12 months." In the event of Jyamma going public, the email suggests that Jyamma might “explore” distributing company shares to team members with stock benefits options. Finally, the email touches on some "long-term strategic opportunities" in the shape of very early discussions with Amazon and Tencent.

<p>
There is some existing public corroboration for the reports of delayed payments. Shortly after Jyamma <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">screened a trailer</a> for their Divine Comedy game at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2025, Italian streamers Blur and IlMasseo <a href="https://www.drcommodore.it/2025/08/26/jyamma-games-blur-ilmasseo-polemiche/">published allegations</a> that the studio still owed them payments for promotion of Enotria: The Last Song the previous year.
</p><p>
Things came to a head in October. According to sources, salaries for July were finally paid. Greco also announced that the studio would develop a 2.5D Enotria spin-off alongside the Divine Comedy game. In an email sent October 1st, he confirmed that Jyamma were "actively engaged in a deal and public listing process" on NASDAQ, to be finalised in "five-six" months. 
</p>
<p>
However, he also revealed plans for mass layoffs "to make the company more sustainable," with the promise to "ramp up again" and discuss rehiring staff once investment had been secured. According to one source, Jyamma made two separate rounds of layoffs in October and December. My sources noted with some bitterness that on the day of the original layoff announcement, Jyamma posted "Happy Birthday to us!" on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jyammagames/reel/DPRy3pACT1q/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As of February 9th, sources tell me that some current Jyamma staff are getting paid. But several former team members are apparently still owed salary payments for August, September and October. 
</p>
<p>
It’s a depressing state of affairs for such an outwardly promising studio. Enotria is both a well-made game and a rich contribution to the wider compendium of Soulsliking - in foregrounding Italian folklore, it talks back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> studio FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.killscreen.com/understanding-sublime-architecture-bloodborne/">representations of European culture and architecture</a>. 
</p><p>
I’m similarly enthused by what I’ve seen and read of Jyamma’s Divine Comedy adaptation, in which "dark forces subvert the promises of the poem," hinting at some degree of creative antagonism with the source text. Still, all of that comes second to ensuring that your staff have secure livelihoods.
</p>
<p>Approached for comment about these allegations of delayed payments, together with the reports of changes of project direction and publisher negotiations, Jyamma CEO Giacomo Greco offered the following general response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enotria was an ambitious project, entirely self-financed, self-produced, and self-published, born from the passion of our team and several industry veterans, with the clear objective of establishing Jyamma Games' identity through the development of original IPs rooted in Italian culture.</p>
<p>The company has always acted with the well-being of its collaborators as a priority and has consistently worked to retain as many team members as possible. We confirm that we have never ceased compensating our collaborators. While some payments have been rescheduled, all commitments continue to be honored, as they have been regularly over the past six years. Following a necessary restructuring to ensure long-term sustainability, the current team is fully aligned with the studio's resources, and there are no payment delays.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter involving Italian streamers, Jyamma Games has always honored and will continue to honor all agreements made. The parties involved are working together to ensure that all agreed obligations are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Jyamma Games refrains from commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding projects or partnerships, and any information regarding its initiatives will be shared when appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've contacted Blur and IlMasseo for an update on whether they're still owed any payments by Jyamma.</p>

<p><a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> are the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">worker-led group</a> who've carried out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">protests</a> against Microsoft's dealings with the Israeli military, amid what Amnesty International and a UN enquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/israel-still-committing-genocide-in-gaza-amnesty-international-says">have called</a> a genocide in Gaza.</p>

<p>According to reporting from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/ice-microsoft-technology-immigration-crackdown">The Guardian</a> and partner publications <a href="https://www.972mag.com/ice-microsoft-azure-leaked-files/">+972 Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/">Local Call</a> earlier this week, leaked documents indicate that ICE increased the amount of data it stored on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform from from 400 terabytes as of July 2025 to almost 1,400 terabytes as of January 2026. The agency are also reportedly using Microsoft "productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data".</p>
<p>In a statement to The Guardian, a Microsoft spokesperson said that while they do "[provide] cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE" via "key partners", the company's policies and terms of service "do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity".</p><p>Following this reporting, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsofts-ties-with-ice-come-under-fire-amidst-allegations-that-the-companys-cloud-and-ai-technology-are-being-used-to-support-mass-surveillance-of-us-citizens/">PC Gamer</a>. "No Azure for Apartheid recognizes that the same Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI technology that forms the technological backbone of Israel's apartheid and genocide is the same technology that powers ICE's violence towards migrants and communities in the United States," the group wrote.</p>
<p>"We, as Microsoft workers, stand in solidarity both with Palestinians and the communities and families in the United States who are being terrorized, detained, murdered, and deported by ICE," they continued. "We echo the demands of hundreds of workers and community members who spoke out as early as 2018 to demand Microsoft cut ties with ICE."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly revoked the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">in September last year</a>, following reporting that this tech was being used for surveilance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

            <p>"I mean, look, I think everybody knows why we announced it that way then." Stay calm, I've got to get my dinner first. "We know some things we're doing." Please stop trying to jump on the bench. "It's going to be a while yet." Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in his latest bout of interview chatter about the RPG. He's confirmed it's running on a new version of the Creation Engine, but will also be a return to Bethesda's "classic style".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I think in many ways <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way," Todd the bod told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">Kinda Funny Games</a>. "As we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well.</p>
<p>"We've spent the last, you know, several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers Starfield, up to Creation Engine 3. that's going to power Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond," he continued. "Obviously we do all the rendering things. We're really happy with the new stuff that we're doing, but also [in terms of] world systems loading, how we bring things into the world, how we get that detail close to the camera immediately." He added that there's also still "a lot of innovation to be done" in terms of making the game's world "feel like you are experiencing it for the first time" when you fire it up.</p>
<p>That last part I'm taking to mean that the game feels like a big leap compared to its predecessors and competition when you first fire it up, in the same way you could argue a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 did. What, I'd never seen horse balls rendered in such detail before, it was natural to feel a bit blown away. Describing Fallout 76 and Starfield as detours is also - fittingly - kinda funny, since it makes them sound a lot less like huge projects which have taken up the majority of the studio's past decade. There's also the fact plenty of folks view both games as navigational miscalculations which have sapped confidence in Bethesda's ability to not only do what they did best with games like Skyrim again, but to take that formula forwards in a fashion that can compete with today's top RPGs.</p><p>To be fair, The Elder Scrolls 6 ending up as a bit of a polarising game wouldn't be too out of step with its beloved predecessors. Skyrim's often criticised for having taken the simplifying of RPG elements too far in an undeniably successful pursuit of mass accessibility. Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 attract similar flak. Even Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> is viewed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-fallout-new-vegas">some people</a> - who are wrong - as overhyped and far too buggy. Basically what I'm saying is that not even a return to this "classic style" with some technical advancement under the bonnet may be enough not to leave TES VI an unquestionable return to form of Bethesda when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">comes out of the oven</a> in the year 3027.</p>
