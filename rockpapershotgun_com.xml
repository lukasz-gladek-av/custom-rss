            <p>Right, time for some box news. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>. Valve have confirmed, or <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-not-like-a-console/">reaffirmed</a>, that its yet-to-be-revealed price will be in line with a regular PC built to similar specs, rather than subsidised in order to try and compete with consoles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking on Skill Up's  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais said the device's price still hasn't been settled on internally due to some factors which are "fluctuating", but said the aim's to offer a "good deal" compared to a the sorts of existing PCs which offer comparable bang for your buck.</p>
<p>He went on to confirm that the price won't be subsidised by Valve in an effort to keep it on the lower end and compete with consoles, an idea that's been floated around on the lines since the box's reveal. To be honest, as someone who can't currently see where the Steam Machine would fit into my existing setup of a decently beefy desktop and a PS5, that'd be something in its favour, but I'm also conscious that I may well just not be the target audience for the thing. Then again, I'm also yet to invest in a Steam Deck despite regularly being told I likely won't regret it, so maybe I just don't like spending money.</p>
<p>"It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," Griffais said of the Machine. "Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you’re making your own gaming PC from parts." Those features are the likes of its small size, quietness, and ability to be easily flicked on via TV remote or controller.</p><p>Basically, a level of ease or convenience which he reckons is "not really something that exists in the PC market right now". That sounds very much like an 'appeal to newbies considering making the switch' pitch to me, but could also have some catchet with folks who're just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-valve-creates-an-entry-point-for-living-room-pcs-the-console-beating-steam-machines-will-follow-argues-baldurs-gate-3s-publishing-director">keen not to muck around with a/their big PC</a> for everything but the most hairdryer-inducing behemoths (hi, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>).</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to see what number Valve finally settle on and judge things from that. Until that point, there are far more important conversations to be had, as James dipped his toe into last week when he tried to define <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">whether the Steam Machine has soul</a>. Can PC hardware be Aretha Frankliny? Probably, I guess.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> has avoided yet another shutdown after being ressurected in server-emulated form by fans <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">earlier this year</a>. According to the modders behind its revival project, The Crew Unlimited, a bug would have seen the game stop working once 2029 rolled around. Thankfully, they say a solution's been found.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This may be one of the most important updates we've ever released, or arguably THE most important," reads <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-update-tcuserver-1.3.0.0">a post</a> from lead developer Whammy4 about The Crew Unlimited's latest server emulator update, 1.3.0.0. They outlined that not long after the server emulator's 1.0 release, the group realised that if the date on the PC it's being played on is set to something after June 2029, the game simply stops working.</p>
<p>"As you may imagine, we were extremely concerned (how many deaths is this game going to go through? TWO weren't enough already?)," Whammy4 explained. "At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end, but that turned out to not be the case. It is an issue within the actual game client itself, and is not intentional but rather a bug. From our research, we've narrowed it down to either the Summit calendar system (from the Wild Run 2015 update), or the daily Crate mission system (from the Calling All Units 2016 update). Likely culprit is the Summit, even though nothing in the summit calendar data references anything about a June 2029 or 2029 in general."</p>
<p>The good news is that the team say they've found "a less than ideal, but working fix" for this potentially lethal bug, which they've dubbed "Y29K", by making some changes to the server emulator's software. So, crisis averted, even if it sounds like more work may be needed to try and find a better solution for the long-term.</p><p>Here's hoping The Crew can manage to go a few years without any more existential threats from this point, even if its initial shutdown's had the silver lining of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">sparking worthwhile debate</a> about what the end of service for online-only games should look like going forwards.</p>

            <p>Well, that was quick. Season two of Prime Video's Fallout show is still weeks away from arriving on December 17th, but a group of modders have wasted no time in studying its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">latest trailer</a> and taking a crack at adding the NCR ranger power armour shown off to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<p>Can't take a break and wait for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-anniversary-update-didnt-quite-land-with-the-impact-many-hoped-for-so-nexus-mods-have-assembled-their-own">anniversary update's fallout</a> to totally dissipate when there's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">modathon</a> on, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, enter the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98482?tab=description">Ranger Power Armour</a> released by modder PrincessAries and co over the weekend. While not an exact replica, it's based on the armour that shows up in the most recent season two trailer (which I've embedded above) at around the two minute and ten second mark, with its wearer walking into a street wild west-style alongside The Ghoul.</p><p>The mod's armour is designed to be similar in stats to the Fallout series' iconic T-51 power armour, mirroring it being a custom set the NCR have developed, rather than the scavenged T-45d Brotherhood sets sometimes seen on NCR soldiers in New Vegas.</p>
<p>As with a lot of the best power armour mods, this set comes with a wide range of customisation options, including four different base paint jobs. One of those is a lick of red paint so you can sacreligiously use the armour to show how into Caesar's Legion you are. Where the mod really shines, though, is in the various accessories you can add to each bit of the armour for a different look and some stat buffs.</p>
<p>The likes of cloaks, backpacks, bandoliers, and helmet lenses can be mixed and matched to create a unique look. I'm a particular fan of the brahmin skulls strapped to your shoulders and enough bullet casings draped over you to be a human ammo box aesthetic, as well as the hoods which make you look like an unruly fusion-powered teenager. Though, it is worth noting that the modders admit the cloaks in particular can be subject to some clipping misbehavior, especially if you opt for a hooded one.</p>
<p>To get the armour, you'll need to have the Far Harbor DLC, then install the mod and head to a small shack north of the power station outside the ruined town of Natick for a short quest. Given this kind of thing's happening already, I'm keen to see what sorts of mods might arrive once season two's actually aired, assuming it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-s3-episode-15-everyone-loves-fallout-and-the-fallout-tv-show">gets folks going</a> like the first one did.</p>
