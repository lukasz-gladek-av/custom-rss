Years ago I wrote <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-crisis-city-building-games/">a piece</a> about what I presumptuously defined as the "emerging" subgenre of city games that respond to the climate crisis, with its attendant catastrophes of unchecked capitalism and resurgent fascism. Today, it feels dangerously like that subgenre is "sub" no longer.</p>
<p>We are engulfed in strategy sims where society is the rind between the formless terrors without and the only-human abusers within. The geography is clogged by Last Cities and Final Bastions Of Humanity, all of them awkwardly avoiding eye contact, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmyuE0NpNgE">the prophets that line the alleyways of Life Of Brian</a>. I guess it's in keeping with the "unchecked capitalism" bit that apocalypse fantasies have become a thriving business. I hope that's not my fault. On the brighter side, roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-we-descend">As We Descend</a> is quite fun, combining moderately baroque turn-based combat with tales of Vernian dystopia. Here's Wot I Think of the demo.

In As We Descend, you dutifully take custody of another Terminal Metropolis, a crenellated steampunk diorama that huddles <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>-style around a light source - not a coal generator, in this case, but an enormous golden hologram, which is possibly the god of the draconian theocracy you'll have to wrangle with as the latest, unwilling First Ranger. 
</p>
<p>
For reasons currently unclear to me, your city is also a huge circular drill that is tunnelling to the centre of the Earth. On each level, you spend turns playing cards to access facilities and stories within the city. You'll also send expeditions into the surrounding caverns to recover technologies such as reactor rods, used to power the forcefields that safeguard your city's descent.
</p>
<p>
The local wildlife don't take kindly to this. That wouldn't be a problem if they were all roundworms and bacteria, but as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, As We Descend has a nasty case of the megafauna. Enemies range in scale and threat level from gristle-filled balloons to massive, skinless Skeletors. Against these foes you shall pitch Age Of Sigmar-esque battalions of fragile arbalests, iron-palmed monks, tanks with tower shields, and clockwork soldiers, unlocked from run to run.
</p>
<p>
Battles see you distributing your units between two radial zones, while a smaller version of the big golden hologram slings ability cards from the rear. Units in the front zone auto-attack enemies between turns, but are naturally exposed to greater harm. The game's card alchemy feels appropriately compressed and dicey. There are cards that tether stat boosts to moving between zones, cards that cause units to "fixate", inflicting extra damage on a selected foe, while losing the ability to target others, and barrier cards to stave off unit wipes. All of which is powered by faith generated by your citizens, as long as you carry on completing quests for them.

I lost plenty of units in the demo - there's a nice sense of being fundamentally outmatched, and the longer you linger on a level, the more you're provoking a chonkier predator to attack your city directly. During my first run, my dystopaville fell to a crablike rhino that had the bad form to materialise after a series of expeditions, with all of my units at half-strength.
</p>
<p>
I'm wooed but not wowed by As We Descend's strategy-tactics sandwich. What lures me more is the glowering enigma of the city itself, whose art deco crevices teem with small, branching stories involving supercilious overseers and buff blacksmiths and the like. There's an agreeable stink of medieval politicking. Yes, humans are probably the real monsters here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">Read more and find the demo on Steam</a> - the full game's out on 27th March.

<p>Brevity soul'd or no, wit can also be the enemy of honesty; a fundamentally performative pin brooch with an artificial sheen. When I go back over my notes after playing a game, at least two-thirds of them will routinely be useless and powerfully crap jokes I've written in lieu of practical points because - even in a document no-one but me will ever read - I cannot bear to cease reminding myself that I'm an implausibly clever sausage.</p>
<p>Occasionally I do remember to just jot down an unadorned factoid. "Cards wot do two things (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>)" says my notes on this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a>. I've had my eye on it for a while, mainly because making your game star a ghost with an axe and calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/axe-ghost">Axe Ghost</a> is some premium Nic Reuben bait, especially if the ghost also has normal human arms for some reason.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2712670/Axe_Ghost/"> </a></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2712670/Axe_Ghost/">How's the demo</a>? It's good! Falls into the "It's either quite hard or I'm quite bad at it, yet I still want to keep playing" category. A tricky one to get right because, as we've already established, I do like to be reminded that I'm very good at everything by all things, at all times.</p>

<p>It does indeed feature cards that do two things, or rather offer two options, or rather actually offer <em>four</em> options because the arrows on the cards can be reverse-toggled. Those arrows are used for shunting around monsters or grouping them together so you can wipe out the entire shoal with your axe, which is where that Tetris comparison comes in.</p>
<p>They're also useful for pushing monsters away. If a single one reaches you it's farewell to normal human arms: you're now entirely dead.</p>
<p>My Sokoban comparison is more spurious, but what I mean here is that you spend time working out which shunts to chain together to create paths without blocking off others, lest your future shunting plans be interrupted. The most basic arrow will target and move an entire group of monster types as long as they're all touching, but it won't work if <em>any</em> of those monsters would end up getting blocked by the move. For those situations, you need a different type of arrow that tracks collision on each monster individually, letting others complete their move even if some of the group get blocked. You get cards that move entire rows one space, cards that move whole columns one space, cards that freeze monsters in place, and so on.</p>

<p>An additional wrinkle here is that the actual axe you need to actually get rid of the monsters is itself a card, although one that shows up regularly. An Axe Ghost without permanent access to his own axe? Communism did this.</p>
<p>It took me a while to wrap my head around all the rules and counter rules but it ends up flowing nicely after a little investment. What I like most about Axe Ghost is how it takes some game things that feel quite ancient and primitive and turns them into a random conundrum generator, offering meaty, puzzly turns that sometimes had me stumped for good stretches.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I could tell, it's made by a single guy. I realise that's not quite as impressive as it used to be, since with 2025 inflation that's more like one and a quarter guys. Still impressive though. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
