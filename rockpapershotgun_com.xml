A few months on from releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">Greedfall 2: The Dying World</a> has received its first major update, and it certainly seems like a fairly big one. First up, there's a whole new region to explore called "Olima, City of Stars", and I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that it has nothing to do with that guy from Pikmin. Its name actually comes from the fact there's a big ole observatory to be found there, though what that entails, you'll have to find out for yourself.

There's also a new companion arriving with this update, Safia, an "anti-imperialistâ€¦ seasoned explorer". Not played any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> myself, but I'm always down for taking down empires. Rifles seem to be her whole shtick, assisting you in battle with them, and there's an implication that you can learn how to use them yourself from her.

This update also comes with a place called the Hub, located on your own ship ("not a boat" developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/spiders">Spiders</a> makes sure to point out, for some reason), once you've acquired one anyway. While on the Hub you can get ready for your next journey, have a natter with companions, and there's also plans to allow you to buy materials from merchants, view romance scenes (wink wink), and more further down the line.

Combat has supposedly seen some improvements now too, in a few different ways overall it's looking smoother, faster, and a bit cleaner too. Spiders offered a more detailed look at how combat has changed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1997660/announcements/detail/543352686106378873?snr=1_5_9_">earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that there's a new disguise system, more regional quests, newly introduced companion quests, a higher level cap, a respec consumable, refreshed UI, and just a whole bunch of bug fixes. Happy Greedfalling!
