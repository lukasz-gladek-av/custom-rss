The funny thing about games is that while making them, if you put something in them, it's quite hard to take that thing back out again. Who knows what that might break! Which can of course lead to people finding things that were never meant to be seen, like cut parts of a game, which is pretty much exactly what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> through the discovery of a level all about Ashley.
</p>
<p>
As shown off by YouTuber and modder Thekempy, this Ashley level seemingly would have been called Chapter 0, acting as a prelude to the main game. In it, you'd essentially be playing the lead-up to the moment Ashley gets captured, with some of the areas potentially intended for her to explore still viewable in-game, just with not much detail or accessible.

Interestingly enough, you might notice some bits that feel a bit familiar. That's because scenes from this cut chapter actually appeared in the remake's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTMwx9-rKe8">second trailer</a>, back in 2022. These scenes never ended up in the final game, leaving them a bit of a mystery, though again, all sorts get cut from games all the time, it's not that odd. But at least we have something of an answer!
</p><p>
Most of what's available to play doesn't function as certain discovered details appear to imply, like cutscenes that are meant to trigger at certain points. There are some animation triggers that lead to Ashley running around a bit too haphazardly for my liking, but for the most part, there's not all that much going on, so you're not missing out on much.
</p>
<p>
In any case, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s roundhouse kicking Leon Kennedy will be back in our arms, I mean, back on our screens soon enough, as he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">set to be playable in the upcoming ninth entry in the series</a>, Resident Evil Requiem, due out next month, February 27th.
