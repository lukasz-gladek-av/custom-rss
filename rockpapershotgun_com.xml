            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you failed to swipe a key for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta, because you <em>neither</em> signed up via the Battlefield Labs programme before 31st July <em>nor</em> watched Your Favourite Creators play the game during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">recent multiplayer reveal</a>, then Don't Sweat It, Soldier, because Drill Sergeant EA Have Your Back in the shape of a last-gasp code giveaway. </p>
<p>All you have to do is sign into the EA and Twitch apps, then watch 30 minutes of Your Favourite Creators streaming the game. Unfortunately for me, the suggestion that I watch 30 minutes of anything on Twitch is a grievous insult akin to filling my wineglass with Vimto or farting on my outstretched hand. I hate game streaming and so do you, which is why neither of us will be playing Battlefield 6 this weekend. I will share further details of the giveaway only out of a sense of absolute perversity.
</p>
<p>Here's the specific wording from Drill Sergeant EA.</p>
<blockquote>The first step in participating is logging into your EA and Twitch accounts and linking them HERE. Then, during Battlefield 6 Open Beta Early Access, August 7th &amp; 8th, tune into your favorite creators streaming Battlefield 6 to unlock your own early access code after watching just 30 minutes.* Once you have your Twitch Drops code, visit Battlefield's Code Redemption page and enter the code to get Early Access added to your account. </blockquote>
<p>The little asterisk there is for "while supplies last". Perhaps it's too late, and you'll have to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boomtown-rats-transformice">Transformice</a> instead.</p>
<p>These giveaways are business as usual for videogame publishers, but I've found EA's attempts to drive up Twitch engagement with Your Favourite Creators kind of eerie. It's an open effort to cook the numbers and fox Twitch's visibility algorithm. I imagine they don't care whether you actually watch Your Favourite Creators, only that you leave your fingerprints on the client, so why not turn on Twitch, lower the volume and spend 30 minutes ensuring that all of your socks are correctly paired.</p>
<p>If you're a real sucker for punishment, EA are also handing out cosmetics for people who carry on Twitching their Favourite Creators. Here's what you get for time served, with some observations of my own about how your state of mind might escalate in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for 1 Hour and, once you have conquered your nausea, you will earn the Mimic Weapons Package</li>
<li>Watch for 2 Hours and, once you have stopped feverishly washing your face, you will earn the Landslide Soldier Skin</li>
<li>Watch for 3 Hours and, once you have stopped cursing the day you were born, you will earn the Shattered Vehicle Skin </li>
<li>Watch for 4 Hours and, once the police have persuaded you to come down from the tree, you will earn the Imperial Soldier Skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I mentioned that I really hate game streaming? I'm sorry if you don't, and I'm harshing your buzz. I probably just haven't found the right streamer. Recommendations pls.

            <p>
Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has posted a sprawling video about the development of Anthem, EA and BioWare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">ill-fated</a> mech <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> shoot-me-do. We've heard about this remarkably torrid period in the RPG developer's existence from other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-never-grasped-dragon-ages-value-as-an-rpg-says-inquisition-writer">ex-BioWare honchos</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-cancelled-rumour">anonymous sources</a>, but perhaps never quite this extensively: the video tops out at an hour long, and this is just part one.

<p>
There's a bit of gossip and speculation from Darrah, but it's an engrossing listen, assuming you're not absolutely sick of the tale of how EA's GaaSy ambitions screwed up BioWare. Here are some highlights based on a quick skimplay.</p>
<p>Darrah begins with the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>, at which point EA were apparently really hammering home the "single player games are dead" angle, and trying to get BioWare onto live service gaming. It was at this point that Mass Effect 3 game director Casey Hudson pitched Dylan, the early codename for Anthem. EA higher-ups apparently loved the talk of a new approach to multiplayer storytelling, but the Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams were, Darrah continues, less than thrilled by the Dylan team's suggestion that BioWare had to move with the times.
</p>
<p>
Darrah himself is ambivalent about Dylan's initial pitch, calling it vague. This vagueness created problems in 2014 when Hudson left the studio, with nobody else quite sure what the game was supposed to be. According to Darrah, too much time was spent at this stage defining the game against the likes of Borderlands and Destiny.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, there were arguments that Dragon Age 4's development team should be reassigned to the Dylan project. Other spats include a fiery response to a particular demo from Patrick Soderlund, CEO of Battlefield developers DICE, and negative feedback from EA to a perceived reduction in the number of Anthem exosuits, or Javelins, based on some WIP figures.
</p>
<p>
As for the name, there was a push to call it Javelins, but EA preferred "Beyond", only to discover that Sony already had a trademark for this. Darrah notes humorously in passing that the original Dragon Age didn't even have dragons when it was given that name.
</p>
<p>
The video brings us up to approximately late 2017, when Darrah himself became involved with Anthem. Look out for the second part down the line. Thanks to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-darrah-talks-about-the-early-development-of-anthem.1263345/">Resetera</a> for passing this on.
