            <p>I don't much enjoy sports sims, but sometimes an imaginative spin on a sport will sneak past my guard. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/electro-bop-boxing-league">Electro Bop Boxing League</a> has spins aplenty. You probably could have stopped at robot boxers, Developer Dob. You didn't have to give it a swaggering electro swing soundtrack as well. Special moves depicted as old-timey computer punched cards? Soldering limbs back on between rounds with a Repair-o-Gun? Little eggheads in lab coats clinging to the back of my gymrat C3PO as he pounds some would-be Megatron to shrapnel? Referee counts presented as a rebooting sequence? Developer Dob, you are spoiling us!</p><!--more-->

<p>There's a demo you can play and I suggest you play it, rather than endure my attempts to riff on boxing terminology. I'll keep this write-up brief. Electro Bop Boxing League is a musical autobattler with a decent dollop of micromanagement and some joyful atompunk presentation. </p>
<p>The opening hurdle that might turn away a few players is that the majority of commands have to be entered on the beat. This includes: completing the button combos for those punchcards; massaging your various gauges to keep your robot mobile, dukes up, and running at an optimal temperature; and button-bashing your way out of a clutch (here represented as a tug-of-war over which robot gets zapped by the other side's accumulated static electricity).</p>
<p>The whole world and HUD twitches and jiggles to the score, helping you nail the prompts, but still, I found this exasperating in the demo - until I realised that you don't have to match the tempo exactly and continuously. Just hitting the odd beat will do.</p>
<p>The robots are beautiful vintage creations - all Rock 'Em Sock 'Em elbows, caterpillar treads and lightbulb eyes. It feels like there's some decent depth of customisation here, too, though I wouldn't put this in the same league as Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon. The career mode sees you unlocking new parts, abilities and passive crew skills from daily manager events. You can also have tourists come view your budding George Forebot to earn some extra dosh, at the risk of them breaking something.</p>
<p>It's out... soon! April 18th, which is barely a month away. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211280/Electro_Bop_Boxing_League/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In my hectic pursuit of a scoop, I have spent a non-zero amount of today peering at a smudgy image of a London bus sign from a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-annihilation">Tides Of Annihilation</a> trailer, trying to work out whether the new gooner-baiting Arthurian slasher has screwed up its portrayal of Britain’s public transport network. If it had, you’d best <em>believe</em> that’d be a headline. I’d have broken the internet with it. “Never mind turning the Dread Knight Mordred into a waifu,” I’d have written, hissing like a kettle. “Those absolute tourists at Eclipse Glow Games have made a mockery of the sacred N19 route from Finsbury Park to Clapham Junction.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>

Unfortunately for journalism, I can’t quite decide whether the sign is accurate or not, so instead I’m here writing that Tides of Annihilation’s bossfights seem fun. Boss, bus – probably an amazing play on words to be had there, but no time, no time, for there are flying golden swords to dodge, atomic axes to parry, and carpets of lightning to jump over. The trailer is below – it comes from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/100-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-apps-new-games-revealed/?linkId=100000348094054">a GeForce blog</a> detailing something called “DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation”. If memory serves, “DLSS 4” is the daytime circular between Archway and Blackfriars, but I’ll defer to the expertise of our hardware editor.

It's a bit of a numbers-fest, isn't it? I don't see the point of a frame-rate over 60, myself. You might need some narrative context. Fortunately, there’s another, longer trailer from a couple of weeks ago that gives you more of an introduction to ivory-mannered heroine Gwendolyn, and features an extended bash with the aforesaid Mordred. This is the one that has the suspicious bus sign in it. Skip to about 2.50 if you're interested, and let me know if you have a breakthrough. There could be a Pulitzer in this.

If you’re not able to watch either video - possibly because you’re on a London bus right now and don’t want the driver to see footage of that bus sign and become enraged – the short take on Tides of Annihilation (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">announced just last month</a>) is that you’re fighting a bunch of demi-gods from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> in a city that has been pancaked by extra-dimensional invaders. Gwendolyn gets DMC-style dodges, combos, parries, grabs and juggles, plus the ability to summon spectral Knights for specific combat roles – there’s a big fiery one for brutish punching, an ice one that’s great for launching, a green one who’s best at a distance, etcetera. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from the regular street fights and boss battles, there are gauntlet-run platforming bits that wreak havoc upon the laws of physics. Sometimes you’re running along a wall as buildings fold together like tectonic plates, sometimes you’re brawling on the ceiling in a lake of gore. There are also vast stone colossi that must be clambered on and tamed. I’m not moved by the game conceptually but it does look like a laugh. There’s no release date yet – here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/Tides_of_Annihilation/">the Steam page</a>.
