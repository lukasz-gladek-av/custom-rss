            <p>
The current sole creator of immersive sim-shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortunes-run">Fortune's Run</a> has abruptly announced that the project will be going on hiatus, because they are going to jail. Team Fortune's lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a "violent crime", following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The news comes in the form of a developer Steam post that accompanies what may prove to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320?l=english">the final Fortune's Run update</a>. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well," Dizzie writes. "My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. 
</p>
<p>
"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that." The post doesn't specify the violent crime, beyond qualifying that it wasn't sexual in nature. 
</p>
<p>
As for Arachne's departure, Dizzie adds that "my case dates from before I met the other dev" and that "she is not related to it in any way". For context, Dizzie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465">blogged about Arachne's hospitalisation in July last year</a>. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," today's Steam post adds.
</p><p>
Arachne had been in charge of Fortune Run's QA and "a few level segments". Following her surgical procedure, Dizzie has been working on the game solo, trying to finish as much as possible before beginning their period of incarceration (it's not clear when, exactly, the sentence was given). "It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away," the post adds.
</p>
<p>
"Since [Arachne and I] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," it continues. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time." 
</p>
<p>
Existing sales of Fortune's Run have been strong enough that Dizzie should be able to afford rent after they're released from prison, and there's "a chance" they'll be able to resume development of Fortune's Run. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time," the post continues. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen."

            <p>There are currently 35 heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, split between the roles of Vanguard (tanks), duellists (DPS) and Strategists (support). That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nagneto_(Earth-14094)">Nagneto</a>, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from an interview with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, in which Guangyun Chen spills the beans on questions of hero design "Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," he said "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero."</p>
<p>The just-launched Marvel Rivals Season 1 is seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-patch-makes-hulk-less-hulky-hawkeye-less-shooty-and-the-goddess-of-death-deader-just-in-time-for-season-1">juicier than the norm</a>. It introduces several new heroes in the shape of the Fantastic Four, together with three new maps, a Doom Match game mode and some special events.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview with Metro, Chen expounds upon the game's competitive design. One detail that catches my eye is NetEase's decision not to enforce a role lock, which would ensure an even spread of Vanguards, Duellists and Strategists per team, but might also scare off the antisocial people who just want to play DPS. You know who you are.</p><p>"Yeah, so we totally get that the community is discussing role lock and role queue," said Chen, when asked whether NetEase would consider changing their stance here. "At its core, it's really about the game balance. So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p>
<p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Strong early days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> vibes here. I for one look forward to the spectacle of six Pennypackers kicking Iron Man's face in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You know when you drop your nice, shiny pen and it rolls under your bed, and you look under there and see it winking from the depths of a stygian expanse of superannuated dust bunnies, lakes of mildew and anomalous debris that absorbs far too much light? Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.
</p>
<p>
OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> is that and also, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game about drilling for oil. The recently released <a href="https://abylight-studios.itch.io/anoxia-station">Itch.io demo</a> is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

In Anoxia Station you lead a huge, mobile rig into the depths of a dying world. In each chapter, you'll deploy your rig so that you can build resource-generating structures such as refineries and convertors, search for pools of petroleum on your radar, then either relocate to the area or expand in that direction. 
</p><p>
You'll also have to worry about keeping your workforce alive, happy and non-mutinous. This is difficult, because there is a lot down here that can either kill you or severely bum you out: heat, suffocation, radiation, earthquakes, marauding fungus, acts of human treachery, oh, and the insects. You'll definitely want to avoid the insects.</p>
<p>Right now, my proud rig the HMS Dork Fortress is nestling close to a clutch of eggs the size of sperm whales. I do not know what lurks in the eggs and I do not wish to find out. If anybody from my crew asks about them I will say that they are just really sticky rocks. I am also going to build a watchtower pronto, so that I can equip my crew with grenades.
</p>
<p>
Each semi-randomised tile-based level is a mass of unholy 2D art, viewed from a cramped, angled perspective. Buildings form shadowy huddles of pipes, windows and turbines, their fittings blurred by hanging mist and the insidious, queasy wobbling of the camera. The soundscape consists of machine tones, tectonic rumbles, and unidentifiable organic noises. Building anything here feels like a presumption, like you're inviting the darkness to take an interest.
</p>
<p>
Again, I adore the vibe. I'm less keen on the interface being made up of very small icons and text. It can be hard to find the necessaries, even given tutorial hints, and that's bothersome because each turn is on a timer. You can pause using F11, but you can't queue up orders while time is suspended. I'll probably acclimatise to the fiddly presentation, but it's going to be a pain if I have to manage any especially elaborate drilling operations. Right now, I'm only worrying about the tiles around my rig. Especially the one with the sticky rocks.
</p><p>
According to developer Yakov Butuzoff, Anoxia Station takes particular inspiration from Into The Breach, Polytopia, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. They've written <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2924310/view/546723866324501263?l=english">a little Steam blog about the core mechanics</a>, putting an emphasis on random map generation and unpredictability: apparently, one of the key objectives is "to make sure something crazy happens every turn". The full game is out... at some point.
