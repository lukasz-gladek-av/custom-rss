            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/polar-star">Polar Star</a> is, basically, rock paper pistol, but with a few dab-handed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> twists that make it instantly compelling.  You're a saloon dwelling varmint sat at a table with nothing but your six shooter and a glass of whiskey for company, and you're accosted by a chain of ne'er-do-wells. Perhaps there's a bounty on your head. Perhaps it's their whiskey you're drinking. It's not clear, but it seems nefarious. You know what ne'er-do-wells are like.</p>

<p>You have three options: drink, prepare, or shoot. Shoot once successfully - while your opponent is drinking - and you win. But if you shoot and fail, you have to use up your other options before you can shoot again. Prepare counters shoots, and drink counters prepare, preventing your opponent from shooting the next round. But, if your opponent also drinks, <em>you</em> can't shoot next round, and if you both shoot at the same time, you both lose. Or, just you lose really. I assume the game doesn't care.</p>
<p>So, simple enough, but then it throws cards into the mix. One reveals what your opponent is going to do next, one resurrects you both the next time you die, and so on. I had to play the tutorial three times to fully grasp that the game wasn't completely chance-based - it doesn't explain itself perfectly - but I went on a nice journey of realising just how neat Polar Star is during those three attempts. The demo is a bit limited, but it does feature an endless mode with card modifiers unlocked.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is how stylish the game is. Low poly smokiness with neon flourishes and nicotine hues, and some southern-fried electronic OST bangers. You can grab the <a href="https://guntlett.itch.io/polar-star-demo">demo here on Itch</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3628980/Polar_Star_Demo/">Steam</a>.

            <p>Last month, Blizzard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-big-collab-is-berserk-yeah-ok-that-ones-pretty-good-i-guess">announced the first of their planned collaboration events</a>/themed cosmetic greed-jamborees for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Kicking things off is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> - Kentaro Miura's dark fantasy manga about a large man swinging a large sword at demons, full of panels that are very good at conveying thrilling duels with a bunch of slash marks and captions that say 'snick' a lot. I'm no superfan, but I do own a few books, and the original anime is one of my favourites - even if its <a href="https://youtu.be/9TRemrRaPjc">brilliant theme song</a> lied to me re: having zero problems in life as long as I'm wearing my glasses.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The cosmetics - four armour sets, a mount, and a pet - are now out, alongside their prices. In brief, buying the whole lot individually (there's no bundle discount or similar available) will set you back 16,500 of Diablo 4's gamerbux, named platinum. To cover that, your best option is the 18,500 platinum bundle. The price? $149.99 US, or £125.99. Cheers <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/diablo-4s-berserk-crossover-dlc-costs-an-insane-usd150">Push Square</a>.</p>
<p>Now, far be it from me to tell you what your money's worth. But (just picking a random example out of the infinite other potential uses for that small fortune) if you popped over to <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/berserk-multi-volume-books">Dark Horse Publishing's website right now</a>, you could pick up the first four deluxe hardbacks of the actual manga for £107. You'd have a few quid leftover too. Perhaps you could buy a very large sippy cup and several gallons of your favourite reading beverage. Yum! Tastes better than a fake fucking horse, anyway. Or, shell out about eight extra quid for volume 5, and you've got the entire Golden Age arc - Guts's origin story, effectively.</p>
<p>Horrific, honestly. Apropos of nothing, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 workers across Activision Blizzard</a> and Xbox early last year. <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/26/video-gamemaker-activision-blizzard-laying-off-400-workers-in-irvine-la/">Activision Blizzard later laid off a further 400</a>. Was this my fault? Please, Blizzard, stop. I'll buy more horses, I promise. I'd ask how the C-suite sleep at night but I already know the answer: without a single dream in their heads that doesn't involve Smaugish wealth hoarding.</p>
<p>If you're new to Berserk, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-guide-to-loving-berserk-the-manga-inspiration-for-the-souls-games">Gaida Zavaris's guide to loving it</a>. In other 'everything is Ready Player One now and I want to go take a nap on some train tracks' news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Destiny 2 is doing a Star Wars crossover</a>. Why, if I was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">staffer who got laid off</a> after working hard on establishing the series' expansive lore only for Bungie to squat a fat log on my creative legacy, I'd sure be plum miffed right about now! Sweating, wiping my brow, can't work out whether to press the button that reads 'preserving my sci-fi universe's atmosphere' or the one labelled 'tauntaun reference'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is wonderful for that plumber guy, but mostly meant piss all for us PC people. The thing is, this version of the game actually comes with some new stuff, and I like new stuff, and publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> only vaguely said all the new bits would be coming to "other platforms". But! I bring good news, as yes, the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition extras are coming to PC as part of a Tarnished Pack DLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This comes from the first FromSoftware Games Event Spring 2025, held earlier today, which <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a> covered and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others">RPG Site</a> kindly extrapolated details from. Now, to be clear, there aren't many details, but something is better than nothing. For one, there'll be a total of four new armour sets to acquire. On top of that there's two new starting classes, Knight of Ides, and Heavy Armored Knight, both of which are, you guessed it, knights! Not particularly exciting given that there's already some knight options, but what can you do? These two knights make up two of the four new armour sets.
</p>
<p>
You'll also have a total of three new looks for your trusty steed Torrent, which I suppose is more than the none you could choose from before. Apparently some more weapons and skills are being added into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> too. At the very least, FromSoftware did say that the DLC pack will be cheap for those not on Switch 2, though I am a bit surprised this isn't just coming in the form of a free update.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is cross our fingers that that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Not Bloodborne 2 But It's Basically Bloodborne 2 Except It's An Online Game game The Duskbloods</a> comes to PC eventually too.

            <p>
Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sims</a> already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-seikyu">Tales of Seikyu</a>, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/">early access on Steam</a> this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there).

<p>
The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute!
</p>
<p>
There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's "secrets." I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.
