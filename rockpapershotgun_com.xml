            <p>
When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> rocks up, rakes in a bunch of success and critical acclaim, alongside the top game of the year prize at Geoffie's Lil Night of Ads, there will be certain expectations of what's next. It's always what's next! Because there has to be more. But whatever more ends up being for developer Sandfall Interactive, the team is trying to make sure they don't just bow down to what people want from them.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>) in a recent interview, chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse shared that he feels "a bit of pressure" from both lovers and critics of the game for the studio's follow-up, but ultimately "it's not so important to us." He went on to say that they'll have "time to get really focused into the next game. We have some great ideas we're so excited to explore, and we don't start from the same point. The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff."
</p>
<p>
Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who apparently had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-lead-writer-had-apparently-never-played-a-video-game-before-writing-it">never played a game before writing this one</a>, echoed these thoughts, even if she did note that she's "a bit of a people pleaser." With that in mind, she says it's "always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game." 
</p>
<p>
Svedberg-Yen does admit to thinking about these expectations from time to time, but when it comes to creative decisions, they always make sure to be guided by their own personal taste as opposed to what people want from them. "I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," she said. "So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."
</p>
<p>
Let's just cross our fingers that whatever's next causes just a bit less discourse about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. Please. I've had enough.

            <p>
The best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> games are often the ones where the thing you actually do is dead simple, with the challenge coming from an intricately woven path of twists and turns on doing said thing. Like, for example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba is You</a>. You (Baba) are a rabbity thing that pushes wordy blocks around, changing the very fabric of reality as you (Baba) do so. And here we are, with one last big update for the game.
</p>
<p>
Said update, as described in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/736260/view/500593045099514415?l=english">Steam post</a>, "most probably be the final large update for BIY." For the most part the post is just patch notes as to what the update contains, seemingly mostly focused on providing new ways for custom level makers to, well, make even more custom levels, alongside some other general fixes and mod support additions.
</p>
<p>
There's a small treasure trove of new objects you (not Baba) can be in place of Baba, like a hotdog, a brain, a cactus, a yes or a no, and most sweetly, a fox. You'll find a handful of new words like become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. What the last two states of emotions may do in the context of puzzles, I don't know, but I ask that you do not make Baba is Angry, because that would make me quite sad.
</p>
<p>
In terms of bug fixes and adjustments, while searching through custom levels you can skip five pages at a time, some ambient loops have been added into the music selection, typos and other miscellaneous mishaps were fixed. On the modding front, that's all a bit too technical for me, but if it's your kind of bag then it'll surely be helpful.
</p>
<p>
It's a touch sad to see this as the more-or-less end of Baba is You, but nothing can last forever! If you've never checked Baba is You out, it's available to pick up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">Steam</a> right this second.
