            <p>This is proving to be one of the worst weeks of my life, for various reasons (no, not because Jason Schreier is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-not-yet-be-content-complete-and-another-release-delay-is-possible-claims-jason-schreier">mad at me</a>). In my time of need, I open the magic portal of escapism and find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> looking back at me like a poison toad.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hello, Pathologic 3! You are that game about saving a town of butchers from the grandfather of all plagues. You are the Stoppardian fantasy about interrogating the bodies and souls of tricksters, oligarchs and killers. You are the inner wobble between mania and apathy. You are the doomed mayoral enterprise in which players impose quarantines and roadblocks, while trying to maintain the trust of some powerful factions. You are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">out now-ish on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve got a time-rewinding feature these days, so that players can reverse their foolish decisions without starting afresh? You're giving players the ability to clear away miasma using some kind of refillable doohickey? Generous of you, Pathologic 3, but I can see the rusty meat cleaver in your other hand.</p>
<p>RPS has an ancient, fraught relationship with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> series. We are beloved among the elder Pathologgers for Quintin Smith’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body">three-part essay on the original 2005 game</a>, and we are also... disliked, to put it gently, for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">somewhat ambivalent about Pathologic 2</a> – the sequel-turned-remake dedicated to just one of the original game’s three playable protagonists. I’m likely going to be reviewing Pathologic 3, and I’m already dreading the fallout if I conclude that I am Not Keen. Still, duty calls. Something's calling, anyway. I hear it in the basement. It sounds like it has a voicebox made entirely of teeth.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> concerned the doings of the Haruspex, a returning local son who fights the plague using a mixture of surgery and steppe lore, Pathologic 3 focuses on the Bachelor, an academic doctor who is pursuing a rumoured immortal man. While it has similar rancid geography, and the same atmosphere of phantasmagorical confusion and despair, it’s a very different and perhaps an easier game in many respects, as Brendy found when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">playing the demo last year</a>. </p>
<p>The often-exhausting open world format is gone. You don’t have to worry as much about the bare necessities of survival, either, and the time-jumping feature allows for some trial and error, though this isn’t exactly routine savescumming – as Brendy summarised, “you earn time travel gunge by playing a euthanasia minigame where you ease the passing of dying people in the street by administering morphine or other drugs”. A Tardis powered by human souls? How very pathological of you, Pathologic 3.</p>
<p>Developers Ice-Pick Lodge appear to be in a difficult place at the moment. Last year, founder Nikolay Dybowski left the studio after players <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">discovered allegations of abuse and kidnapping</a>. The remaining staff have yet to really comment on these reports. It’s not clear they ever will. I can imagine the painful legalities that may be involved.</p>
<p>Ice Pick are Russian-founded, and you may wish to avoid their games if you’re concerned about indirectly funding Russia’s vicious, zealous and cynical attack on Ukraine. They are currently based in Kazakhstan, however, who appear cautiously supportive of Ukraine’s independence and are calling for peace (I am no expert on the geopolitics here). The developers have also spoken out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commenting back in 2022 that "a crime is being committed in our name”. </p><p>If Pathologic 3 is a success, Ice-Pick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">will hopefully make Pathologic 4</a>. This will star the Changeling, a young girl who can restore life or take it away through touch. Pathologic aside, Ice Pick are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pathologic-devs-are-making-darkwood-2-with-acid-wizards-blessing-in-a-frankly-outrageous-piece-of-horror-synergy">partnering with Hooded Horse and Acid Wizard to make Darkwood 2</a>.  </p>

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has provided an update as to how the studio are planning to go about handling the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">use of generative AI</a> in the making of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>. In an effort to alleviate concerns, the newly decided plan is to avoid using it in any capacity as part of the concept art development process. In general, Larian are aiming to ensure any in-game generated assets in their games come from models "trained" on data Larian already own, rather than risking the charge of creative theft or actual copyright breach.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Vincke revealed these plans in an answer to a question about the studio's Generative AI use submitted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">public AMA session</a> the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">have hosted today</a>, January 9th. The exec kicked off by stating that "there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity", though he seemingly isn't ruling it out for future games.</p>
<p>"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration," he continued. "We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion. So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development. That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>Further on in his response, he outlined the studio's current plan when it comes to using generative AI to make art in games at large. "We will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data," Vincke wrote. "If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="652"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wombat_Medic/">u/Wombat_Medic</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/">Games</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>In between those two points, the CEO made clear that Larian still plan to experiment with generative AI in other areas. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is," he wrote. "We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game."</p><p>Elsewhere <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyliprj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in the thread</a>, Larian's machine learning director Gabriel Bosque offered an explanation of an area in which the studio are making use of this sort of tech. "There is currently one example of machine learning generated assets that end up in the game and that is within our cinematics and animation pipeline," he wrote. "In this pipeline we try to capture the actor's performances as best as we can, so we use machine learning models to clean, retarget and even add motion when it's not motion captured. These models are trained exclusively with Larian data."</p>
<p>In my eyes, the changes outlined by Vincke are generally positive, though the matter of controlling and knowing definitively where every bit of data a model has pulled from originates feels like something which could be tough to pull off in practice. I'm no expert, though - perhaps the solution is as simple as locking your herd of generative AI models in an isolated room that only contains internal data. In the long run, there's also the question of whether 'acceptable' usage of generative AI like this might lead to more wholesale and unregulated adoption down the road.</p>
<p>For now, at least there'll be no weird AI portraits in whichever dungeons Divinity sends you to investigate.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> publishers Hooded Horse are imposing a strict ban on generative AI assets in their games, with company co-founder Tim Bender describing it as an “ethics issue” and “a very frustrating thing to have to worry about”. </p>
<p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways… suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku</a> in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'” I assume that's not a verbatim quote, but I'd love to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>The publishers also take a dim view of using generative AI for “placeholder” work, or indeed any ‘non-final’ aspect of game development. “We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender went on. </p>
<p>“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.” As an example of this slipping-through, see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">the accidental presence of a generated placeholder in The Alters</a>.

</p><p>Hooded Horse employ two artists for marketing, and Bender feels “it would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this.”</p><p>As with much discussion of generative AI, the difficulty of Hooded Horse’s position is pinning down what they're trying to ban. Does an artwork count as generated if somebody used the tech to make a base image of some kind, then fleshed it out and finished it off at length by hand? In general, genAI has become pervasive and hard to quantify across the divisions of game development, thanks not least to the deliberately imprecise, all-enveloping language of the companies selling it. There’s the gloomy underlying reality that a lot of genAI tools are being forced into operating systems and search engines in order to artificially boost “uptake” - it's hard <em>not</em> to use genAI, at this stage. </p>
<p>I write all this not to suggest that bans are useless, but that they need to be more detailed and specific. In general, whether they favour the tech or not, companies need to start talking in-depth about their usages of generative AI. As a small and slightly weird example from the world of education, James Allen’s Girls School in South London recently unveiled an <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/jamesallensgirlsschool/jags-ai-charter-and-curriculum">AI charter</a>, stipulating what they consider fair game both for teachers and for pupils.</p>
<p>I’d love to see similar documents from publishers, though I’m not expecting miracles in a world where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">the largest PC storefront’s approach to generative AI disclosures is practically useless</a>. But still, perhaps Larian will surprise me at their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">imminent Q&amp;A about generative AI usage in the forthcoming Divinity</a>.</p>
<p>Bender acknowledged the trickiness of policing generative AI when working with external partners, while reiterating the need for a blunt ban. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p><p>As an example of the difficulty of policing generative AI usage by third parties, consider the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">AI-generated material in trailers for Postal: Bullet Paradise</a>, which has now been cancelled - developers Goonswarm have attributed this oversight to external artists.</p>
<p>The minutiae of different genAI applications aside, the broad cultural or political case against generative AI has, IMO, remained pretty consistent (yes, this is the point in the 'news post' where I deliver the customary lecture, please skip to the comments if you are weary of such things). The biggest bots operate by parasitically appropriating and undermining the work of theoretically any and all human workers, whether or not you define this as actual theft or copyright infringement. Their actual utility beyond the grand promises is broadly unproven, and in some cases, obviously non-existent.</p>
<p>Being companies, the companies pushing them aren’t following the public interest: they are helping to drive up energy usage and emissions, and saturating daily life with “companion” technologies that may distort online discourse and in some cases, contribute to mental illness. Within the games industry, the tech is viewed by many executives and shareholders as a quick fix for unsatisfactory profit margins, and a tacit excuse for cutting staff.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make every usage of generative AI abominable – I can understand the appeal for smaller devs with minimal resources, and I am myself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">interested in art that makes genuinely imaginative and substantial use of generators of all kinds</a>, rather than just calling on them to “enhance productivity” - providing those technologies are responsibly operated.</p>
<p>But generative AI needs to be understood as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a form of class war</a> that will principally benefit the already-filthy-rich, and which is fundamentally anti-social in encouraging greater reliance on profit-driven corporate tools rather than solidarity with coworkers and peers.</p>
<p>Lecture over! For a more open-ended and nuanced discussion of generative AI in games, here's Sam Horti's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horrible-boring-and-cheap-experts-pan-new-chatbot-npcs-but-some-leave-room-for-optimism">recent excellent catch-up</a> with a brace of developers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and Thirsty Suitors writer Meghna Jayanth and Failbetter's narrative director Chris Gardiner.</p>
