            <p>Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal whipped out their dark shades and finest tactical trench coat at last night's State of Play, announcing that a remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> is set to sneak into our lives early next year. It's a "modernized" version of the classic stealthy and shooty sci-fi sojourn.</p>

<p>The remaster is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3131640/Deus_Ex_Remastered/">set to hit PC on February 5th, 2026</a>. As you can see in the trailer above and as explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/">PS blog</a>, it gives the original game a visual facelift that smooths out some of its old school blockiness, with revamped character models that boast "smoother lip-sync animations and ragdoll physics". Elsewhere in visuals department, Aspyr and Eidos have touched up the various environs JC Denton sneaks or shoots through with "reimagined lighting, dynamic shadows, water physics, particle effects, and fully updated textures".</p>
<p>They've also worked in some quality-of-life additions like autosaves, zippier loading times, achievement tracking, and cloud saves "across supported platforms". Rounding things out is revamped support for controllers which "draws inspiration from what Eidos-Montréal pioneered in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and Mankind Divided" with "refined radial menus, fluid weapon management, and streamlined navigation". Plus, setups with ultrawide or multiple monitors will work out of the gate.</p><p>So, a very remastery remaster. The question is whether it'll be as tempting a purchase for PC folks as I imagine it'll be on console. As of writing, the original Deus Ex's game of the year edition can be grabbed for less than £1/€1/$1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/">Steam</a> thanks to a deal running until September 29th. Over on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">GOG.com</a>, it's currently £5.99, but is also part of the platform's preservation program, meaning GOG themselves have made sure it runs as it should on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex_revision_mod">platforms</a> host the Deus Ex Revision mod which offers a substantial fan-made revamp of the game, and it's tough to say whether the £22.49/€26.09/$26.99 that's been stapled to the remaster right now - set to go up to £24.99 and equivalents once it's out - will be that appealing to folks keen for an Extra dose of Deus.</p>
<p>Time will tell if going the full remake route might've been a better call on Aspyr's part, at least from a PC-centric perspective.</p>
