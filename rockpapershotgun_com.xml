            <p>Revived <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y survivabuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> got a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">early access release date of January 13th</a> the other week. However, the team behind it how now confirmed you shouldn't expect to see it hit Steam at that point, with the game's executive director not seeing the need to knock on Valve's pipe-laden door yet and keen to avoid an early access spent drowning in negative reviews.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This comes from the first <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">post adressing frequently asked questions</a> that Hytale's current devs have put out since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">securing the rights to it from Riot</a>. Right off the bat, executive director Patrick 'Lyall' Derbic addressed whether the game'll be hitting the Steam platform.</p>
<p>"No, not initially," he wrote. "We want to spend our time in early access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing. Steam is a great marketing tool, but one that we might never need. This doesn't mean we will never be on Steam - just that we do not see the necessity of it yet."</p>
<p>On one hand, working with a more concentrated group of players you can grill for in-depth thoughts on the game early doors sounds like a good plan, especially since the team have been very clear what folks will be getting on day one will be quite rough around the edges and have lots of room to grow. On the other, there's perhaps an argument that initially ducking criticism from folks outside of those likely already keen on the proposition of Hytale could potentially lead to blind spots in terms of helping it appeal to a wider audience down the line.</p><p>In any case, I'm not a game developer and certainly appreciate the tough task any game nowadays faces in carving out a reputation for itself that can attract eyeballs and avoid being buried amid the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">massive avalanche of games</a> constantly competing for players' hours.</p>
<p>The rest of the FAQ post saw Derbic acknowledge things like the fact the team are working on getting region-specific pricing up and running for "a limited number of countries to start with", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">$20 being the base price worldwide for now</a>. Extra cosmetics will be added, but there'll be no pay-to-win offerings as far as monetisation goes. Finally, pets, animal taming, and fishing are all in the works, but won't be there in January.</p>
<p>The full thing's also worth giving a read if you're unsure about the different permutations of the three different editions of Hytale being sold out of the gate. Derbic and co have also shared the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements">hardware specs</a> you'll need to meet to comfortably get the sandbox up and running on your machine.</p>

            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">chaos in RAM production</a>, with mass shortages jacking up street prices to are-you-joking levels, now has a major manufacturer casualty. <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">Micron have announced</a> the end of Crucial, their consumer brand for PC memory and SSDs – and likely a familiar name to gaming PC builders who’ve been hooking up their storage drives and slotting in their RAM sticks for decades.</p>
<p>"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments," wrote Micron’s Executive VP and Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s a whole bunch of AI data centres cropping up, and Crucial are rudely hogging memory hardware that could be put to more profitable use than merely supplying grassroots interests in computing and games. Important uses! Like generating a thumbnail image of Mr Beast pretending to swim away from a shark, or unilaterally rewriting article headlines in Google Discover so they’re full of incoherent lies. God, you PC people are so selfish.</p>
<p>Crucial RAM and SSD shipments will continue until 2026, though expect the former, especially, to remain at silly-high prices while that data centre demand keeps shortages short and costs in the clouds. Probably worse so than before, now that there’ll be one less company trying to keep stock flowing.</p><p>After February, they’re gone for good, which is a huge shame. Crucial had been making quality, relatively affordable components and storage right up until Micron’s act of filicide, with the likes of the T500 and X9 Pro currently holding pride of place in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">best SSDs</a> list. I’ve even had a few more recent models – the T710 NVMe drive and the external X10 – in my cupboard, waiting for me to find the time to test them. The PC I’m writing this on, and have played games for years with, has a Crucial P5 as its main SSD, and I somehow remember choosing a 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix RAM set for my first DIY build after reading an agreeable review of it in PC Gamer’s then-tiny hardware section.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a pile of to-be-benchmarked components in your house, that’s a lot of hobbyist history to just... end. And for what?</p>
