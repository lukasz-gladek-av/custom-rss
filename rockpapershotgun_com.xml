            <p>You're shuffling through the desert scrub, wondering if the clawed beasts just a few yards away have spotted you yet. You've made sure to pop a Stealth Boy just to be extra safe, and told Raul that if his knees creak at an inopportune moment, he's on his own. Then, you realise you brought Rex along, and he's gotten stuck on a rock several meters behind you. Finally freeing himself, the good boy bounds towards you at full speed. This should be the point in some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> stealthing that you realise it's brown trousers time.</p>
<p>It isn't, because Obsidian weren't total sadists when they designed the thing. It does take you out of your Mojave roleplay a bit, though. Thankfully, I can report that a modder has taken it upon themselves to ensure that New Vegas now benefits from the finest in sneaking dog technology.</p>

<p>The modder who's cracked the code to covert canines goes by Wombat, and has been doing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/95967?tab=description">plenty of cool stuff</a> with New Vegas' animations as of late. Their '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96002?tab=description">Dog Sneak Animations</a>' does exactly what it says on the tin, adding in some extra movements which allow companions like Rex and Dogmeat to drop into a prone crawl whenever your character decides the time is right for stealthy crouch-walking.</p><p>Seriously, just look at Rex go in the video about, tail wagging just enough to betray how happy he is at the idea of pouncing on some unsuspecting raider. Are dogs actually this good at sneaking in real life? As a cat owner, I've got no idea, but if nothing else the animation's cute enough to distract you momentarily if you sneak yourself into a tight spot you're not going to be able to get out of.</p>
<p>The mod should also support modded dog companions, and judging by the comments could potentially be tweaked to include New Vegas' coyote-snake hybrid Nightstalkers, who'd certainly fit as sneaky slithering sidekicks. Wombat also notes that they've already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94901?tab=description">added to some sneak animations</a> to another non-human companion in the form of loveable robot ball ED-E. Though, there's no video preview for that one, so I can't tell you whether it causes the bot to grow limbs and start scrabbling around on his belly like the dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy creeping around with one of the Mojave's mutts, you'll need to grab a few other mods to get sneaking dogs working. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a>'s up first, with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277?tab=description">JIP LN NVSE Plugin</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation Plugin</a> to follow, all of which are common New Vegas frameworks.</p>

Reader, I am about to venture into that terrible ninth circle of videogame journalist cringe known as pitching your own game in an article. A while ago, I <a href="https://x.com/dirigiblebill/status/1501695516035403780">mused aloud on Xitter</a> that a Batman game (or offbrand spiritual homage) from the perspective of people trying to commit petty crimes in Gotham City would be Interesting and/or Countercultural.</p>
<p>You could portray Batman himself as both a lone vigilante and a pervasive environmental factor - a morbid, hallucinatory tendency of the architecture itself, gradually provoked and intensified by tiny acts of larceny and vandalism. Kind of like the Eye of Sauron, but it’s the Bat Signal, and instead of fighting the urge to wear the Ring, you’re stealing candy bars and writing on toilet walls.

<p>
The above “Batman but it’s the pedestrian POV” video from Gaming with Griff Griffin – disclosure, he’s an old colleague of mine from my time at Future Publishing in the early 2010s – isn’t really what I’m talking about. It shows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> from the perspective of random civilians, spectating on fights (with the usual slowmo) or watching the Caped Misbehaver glide and zipline through the cloudy night.</p><p>Still, it’s close enough to my Twitter concept that I’m going to sue the pants off Griffin. Or burst through his window in a latex suit and delete all his browser tabs… then open and close the browser again so that he can’t restore his previous webpages. With any luck, he’ll become the Joker and we can have a proper vendetta. It’s at least two years since I last had one of those.
</p>
<p>
The accompanying voiceover and editing elicit the quickfix reaction energy of TikTok and similar shortform video platforms. It works well enough, not least because Arkham Knight’s city is so sheeny, dirty and convincing. But it leaves me hankering for a longer video or write-up with fewer changes of POV - perhaps *ominous roll of thunder* a diary series like the ones we used to read on RPS before half the writing team got Thanos-snapped or rode off triumphantly into the sunset. I’m thinking of coverage akin to role-playing a peasant in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, treating it like a medieval life sim. But perhaps what I’m really thinking of, again, is a standalone game.
</p>
<p>
How would it feel, to be remotely anti-social and rebellious in a city prowled by Batman? You could lean into the Adam West absurdity of Bruce chasing after kids for sticking gum to park seats. Or you could give your character more of a backstory, and embrace pathos. Maybe you’re breaking into a pharmacy to get medicine for your mum. 
</p>
<p>
You could also use the format to play with the idea that Batman is, you know, kind of a big dirty fascist and one-man militia, deploying his billions to terrorise poor people who are always characterised as loudly dressed freaks or irredeemable hooligans in vests. You could investigate the idea that Batman is absolutely off his rocker, and that his derangement pervades the very stones and skies of Gotham City, sharpening the spires and filling the sewers with bats. You could play with the thought that we are all trapped in Batman’s dreadful dreams.
