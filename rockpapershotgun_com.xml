            <p>By the great transport gods, trolleymageddon is upon us! It's the end of the line as we know it, and I feel fine. All of that is to say that two wacky trolley-related games are releasing within days of each other, no doubt driving fans of the budding genre off the rails or road.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>, a game about a famous philosophical quandary and also at least one tale of a girl falling deeply in love with a tram, pulled up at this stop on September 12th. Boarding costs £5.20/$6.49/€6.33 right now, or £5.40 if you want the deluxe edition the comes with a mysterious and possibly satirical DLC dubbed '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3550600/The_Trolley_olution/">the V.I.P. lever</a>'. If you hurry, you can probably still catch it! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731330/TROLEU/">Troleu</a>, a game that tasks you with checking tickets and occasionally kicking the bottoms of troublemakers as a trolleybus conductor, is due to pull up on the opposite side of the stop later today, September 15th. Make sure you've got your ticket ready!</p>
<p>If you opt to get on The Trolley Solution's tram, which is named Trolley-San, you're in for a series of amusing scenarios/puzzles based around Phillipa Foot's famous trolley problem. You know, the one with the unstoppable train speeding towards a point at which some tracks separate, with some unfortunate folks strapped to the rails of both forks, and a lever presenting the chance to save one group at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>As I discovered when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trolley-solution-is-a-moral-quandary-that-suddenly-turns-into-a-tragically-touching-tale-of-tram-love">gave its demo a go back in June</a>, The Trolley Solution takes that scenario in a whole bunch of wacky directions, including one which politely requests permission to tweet something highly controversial about footwear from your Twitter account. That's probably less of a threat if you're solely on BlueSky or have smartly given up the socials. Also, this happens:</p>
<blockquote>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough - are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</blockquote>
<p>Given the updated Steam page images feature the likes of a person pushing a tram up an incline like Sisyphus, I can only assume the full version's even wackier.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, meanwhile, is a bus conductor sim with attitude. Lest you accuse me of falsifying its trolleyness, the Steam description insists on a couple of occasions that this is a "trolleybus". I've no idea what the difference between the two is, but our Nic liked the demo when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/troleus-demo-is-for-anyone-whos-ever-wanted-to-physically-kick-someone-out-of-a-moving-bus">gave it a go back in June</a>. That said, while he enjoyed lobbing folks with fake passes out of the doors "at which point they fly off down the street like a crisp packet in a gale", he was neutral about the child kicking you can do if you wish. Here's his conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>Right, now pick your transport and get on. Or, divide yourself in two somehow and board both. Or board neither and stay home to play something else. The choice, as when dealing with tram quandaries and ornery passengers, is yours.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure the just-released Troublemaker 2: Beyond Dream is one of those "good games" you're all so bloody obsessed with. My working summary, based on 30 minutes with the demo, is that it's an unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">Like A Dragon/Yakuza game</a> developed with a fraction of the budget, and set in "fictionalised" Indonesia. That's to say, it's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> comedy beat 'em up with a bunch of other genres haphazardly stirred in. 
</p>
<p>
I compared it to Rockstar's work and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-dying-light-a-martian-themepark-sim-a-glossy-rpg-remake-and-some-cuddly-lego-co-op">this week's Maw</a>, which was Mostly Wrong. This is a predominantly on-foot experience, for one thing, and you can't grievously assault people at random. There are designated gangs of hoodlums you're permitted to punch out, and as far as I can tell, you have to wait for them to Make Trouble first. It seems very polite and passive for a brawler. Also, you get to transform briefly into a dying cow.

<p>
I'm writing up the demo partly because "Troublemaker" is a brilliant name for an urban sandbox brawl-me-do. Such boisterous Beano energy. Petition to call the next Call Of Duty "Bang Street Kids" and the next Doom "Marine the Minx". The previous Troublemaker from 2023 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498740/Troublemaker/">which was pretty well reviewed</a>) took place in a high school - and what is a city, I guess, but a larger school with fancier social dynamics and also, roaming delinquent students called "cars" that waste you instantly on contact. I'm interested to see how far they can extend this "troublemaking" concept. Could we perchance Make Trouble in outer space?</p><p>I'm also writing this up because while I'm not very sold on the button-mashy core combat system, I'm quite struck by the setting. The demo map is a believable jumble of spaces, their disorder amplified by film grain and pop-up. There are neon sculpture trails, pavements lined with scooters, courtyards roamed by lonely broom pushers, half-constructed concert stages, and noisy backstreets where random guys stand on crates twerking. That last one could be a bug.</p>

<p>It feels like a celebration of somebody's neighbourhood. Sadly, you can't enter all the shops and coo over local brands of fast food - often, you're treated to an anime illustration of a shopkeeper. I sound like a massive stinking tourist, I know. I've only ever been to Indonesia in videogames, the last one being the very different <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/afterlove-ep-review">Afterlove EP</a>.
</p><p>
One early hurdle to overcome is the humour. I'm not sure if it's innately awful or poorly localised in English. Possibly, it's both. Example: dropping straight into one of the demo's free roam modes, I approach a man fishing from a bridge. We've barely exchanged hellos when his wife runs up and castigates him for fishing all day. She makes unflattering reference to his "pole" and bullies him back to work with the threat of withholding "our nightly spicy time". I am left alone on the bridge with nothing but questions. And a pole. I try my hand at some fishing myself, but lose interest when I fail the QTE.
</p>
<p>
The jokes do improve in the course of my demo, however uneven the English translation. Subsequently, I meet the aforementioned dying cow, slumped on a corner with a gaggle of onlookers. I moo at the cow sympathetically. The cow tells me that I'm rubbish at speaking cow. This cow, it turns out, has been "gifted by God with critical thinking", and yet now its sorry fate is to be butchered and cooked into rendang. 
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
I ask whether the cow has any final wishes, and it asks me to pass laws punishing corrupt government officials who steal money intended for 5G towers, or something to that effect. I sense that there may be a joke I'm missing here about Indonesian politics (for context: the game's start-up disclaimer puts the word "fiction" in air quotes). I am unable to pass any laws in the demo, so the cow settles for asking me to help it go on a rampage. There follows a minigame in which <em>I</em> am the cow, barging through cars that conveniently burst like soapbubbles.
</p><p>
Aside from brute catharsis, the tragic bovine encounter also furnishes me with some important background knowledge. Shortly afterwards, another sidequest sees me answering trivia questions posed by a couple of blokes doing a vox pop livestream of some kind. What's rendang made of, they ask? Aha! I know this! That cow was complaining about it earlier!</p>
<p>I somehow score full marks on the quiz, or at least, that's what the NPCs tell me. I celebrate by getting into some lumbering and disconnected brawls with mysteriously hostile dudes in vests, involving light and heavy attacks and parries when I can be bothered. Then I decide that it's time to report back with my findings. It's a deflating end to a demo in which I got to rampage through not-Jakarta as a cow.
</p>
<p>
Troublemaker 2 won't be toppling the likes of Yakuza Zero anytime soon, but it has a similar sense of abandon and generosity. Going by the demo, at least, it's a joyfully ungainly Xmas panto of a game, all glitter and gags and wonky stage punches. Creators Gamecom Team started out as a high school project in 2014, and have also made a bunch of Troublemaker games for mobile. I think I've Made enough Trouble for the foreseeable, but I'm rooting for them. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479770/Troublemaker_2_Beyond_Dream/">Read more on Steam</a>.
