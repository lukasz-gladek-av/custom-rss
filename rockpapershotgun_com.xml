            <p>Last year I covered the demo for Void War, robotically describing it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftl-meets-warhammer-40000-in-tactical-space-sim-void-war">FTL meets Warhammer 40,000</a>, because that is what it is, and sometimes, you have to call a Spade Marine a Spade Marine (I did enjoy the demo, as flagrantly combinatory as the game may be). </p>
<p>Void War's art direction has apparently proven a little too familiar in places for Games Workshop’s liking. Developers Tundra Interactive report that the Warhammer publisher issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice earlier this year, which led to their game being <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/">temporarily removed from Steam</a>. </p>
<p>Initially, it was thought that the DMCA notice was a nonsense claim similar to that levelled at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-videogame-no-players-online-resurrected-on-steam-after-a-disgruntled-former-friend-had-it-exorcised-via-dmca">No Players Online</a>, the DMCA system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/river-city-ransom-underground-pulled-from-sale-following-copyright-claims">being perilously easy to abuse</a>. It was issued by somebody called Mal Reynolds, and Mal Reynolds is also the name of Nathan Fillion’s character in Firefly. Suspicious indeed. Tundra have now spoken with Games Workshop, however, and confirmed the claim’s authenticity, though they've yet to clear up the implication here that interplanetary gunslinger Mal Reynolds is secretly a copyright lawyer.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Tundra Interactive / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to the developers, Games Workshop's inquisitors were particularly irked by the design of some shoulderpads in one of the featured trailers, referred to in correspondence as "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim". Find a screen of the armour at stake in the vicinity of this paragraph. Tundra insist that those convex shoulderpads are all their own work, but say they’ve removed the trailer anyway to avoid disruption.</p>
<p>"All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists,” reads <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">a statement to IGN</a>. “While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." </p>
<p>As ever with these things, it is possible to decry how companies with massive legal teams slice the ankles of smaller independent developers, while also acknowledging that the game in question is a screaming rip-off, however entertaining.</p>
<p>That aside, I could absolutely imagine Warhammer 40,000's Imperium launching a crusade in response to copyright infringement. Those Chaos Space Marines are naught but tepid plagiarists. You can’t just glue some novelty Halloween fingers and a rug to your Primarch armour and say you’ve invented the wheel, Horus! Nathon Fillion is on his way over with a subpoena.</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! Peeling back the curtains, I discern traces of blue advancing through sallow clouds, a hint of stray sunshine gracing the soggy leaves in the drive. All signs point to the onset of spring, but I will not be fooled. This is a classic Maw stratagem to waylay vitamin D deficient news editors. The creature is trying to tempt me into the open so that it can shower me in digestive juices (what you in the normal world are pleased to call “rain”). </p>
<p>No, best pull the curtains closed, count the fuel drums under the table, and check that the shotgun is loaded. We will not be lured outside. We will play new PC games instead. Here they are.</p>
<h2>Monday 9th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/">The Oily Depths</a>, you are a submarine driller trying to make quota. What do the levers and buttons scattered around your cockpit do? That’s for Them to know and you to find out to your cost.</li>
<li>If you thought being a submarine driller was rough, you may not appreciate the “stress inducing carpal tunnel gameplay” of rapidfire restaurateur sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3734290/Goblin_Sushi/">Goblin Sushi</a>.</li>
<li>I ain’t a rat, see! Jimmy the Snitch, he’s the rat. I saw him, Mickey the Judas and Turncoat Tony in the kitchen with the candlestick. Hang on, boss, I’ve forgotten what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3725630/WISE_GUYS/">game</a> I’m playing.</li>
<li>More chokepoints await your armies in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3093020/Circle_Empires_2/">Circle Empires 2</a>, the RTS equivalent of bacteria colonies fighting over a platter of Petri dishes.</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 10th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/">Relooted</a> is a side-scrolling heist game in which you pinch colonial artefacts back from private collectors and exhibits. It doesn’t belong in a museum, Indiana!</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Mewgenics</a> is a misanthropic turn-based tactics game featuring an army of mutant lab cats, created by the digital vivisectionists behind The Binding of Isaac.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> is an ornate and ponderous first-person survival shooter in which you try to navigate an island’s worth of claw-some carnival marionettes.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506100/Shadows_of_the_Afterland/">Shadows of the Afterland</a> is a supernatural point-and-click detective game starring a lost soul with two warring identities who can also possess the living. Imagine if Holmes and Watson were one person with a million faces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 11th February</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> is one part RPG beat ‘em up remake, another part brand new game. Special features include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-director-says-actor-accused-of-sexual-assault-was-cast-for-his-slimy-feel">a voice actor accused of sexual assault</a>.</li>
<li>Grasshopper Manufacture have yet to manufacture a single goddamn grasshopper but they <em>have</em> made a new third-person story-driven time cop actioner called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> (pictured).</li>
<li>If the last two are too outwardly brutal for you, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">Starsand Island</a> is an early access anime Stardew Valley. Come, bask in the exquisite penury of equatorial agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 12th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m including ecology sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452130/ANLIFE_MotionLearning_Life_Evolution/">ANLIFE: Motion-Learning Life Evolution</a> partly because I wonder if this could be the Good Kind of machine learning, i.e. a game built around such ideas, rather than deploying them for efficiencies, and also, because this is the game Hayao Miyazaki called “an insult to life itself”.</li>
<li>The folk behind Half-Life fan remake Black Mesa are back with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Rogue Point</a>, a four-player, merc-on-merc, early access FPS.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488540/Crimson_Capes/">Crimson Capes</a> is <del>a lesser-known Marvel franchise</del> <del>a vampire bowling team</del> <del>a series of redstone promontories</del> a 2D pixel art fantasy sword-o-brawler that reminds me distantly of Blasphemous.</li>

<h2>Friday 13th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tarsier are back with another helping of mutant ogres and unspeakable urchins in horror platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/">Reanimal</a>. This one’s got some royally mucky sheep.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2069250/High_On_Life_2/">High On Life 2</a> is more of the first game’s fast and flimsy Rick &amp; Morty-esque sci-fi shoot-comedy, with all-new kickflips to accompany the talking guns. </li>
</ul>
<p>What are we in the Treehouse doing this week, aside from listing new games and hiding from the ravenous sky? I missed the morning meeting, so I’ll have to speculate a bit based on conversations from Friday.</p>
<p>Mark is reviewing a videogame. Ollie has started a lingerie business (and not for the first time). James is reviewing a videogame. Julian was last spotted walking beside the M25 in the vicinity of Leatherhead – if seen do not approach, call 999. I am reviewing a videogame. Jeremy has discovered several new butterflies and is now being held hostage by a rival entomologist clan. Callum is counting to one trillion. Dion is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77QqWVz4iEE">the fountain of affection, the instrument of joy</a>, to keep the good time rolling he's the boy, he's the boy. How about you?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>' director Ryosuke Horii has addressed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-fans-are-demanding-sega-recast-a-kiwami-3-actor-and-dark-ties-may-make-the-situation-worse">controversial casting of actor Teruyuki Kagawa in the remake</a>, which has resulted in fan backlash due to a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022">2022 report from Shukan Shincho</a> detailing sexual assault allegations against the actor. Kagawa apologised at the time, but didn't specify what he was apologising for or confirm the events reported in Shukan Shincho's article.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking about Kagawa's casting as Kiwami 3 secondary antagonist Goh Hamazaki in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2077376.html">GAME Watch</a>, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">IGN</a> have subsequently translated, Horii said the following:</p>
<blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote>
<p>The RGG Studio developer also added that not recasting characters like Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro - the latter a key ally of Kiwami 3 protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, played in the new version of the game by Show Kasamatsu - would have "certainly be safer" in terms of avoiding "online criticism". However, Horii said, RGG "felt there was no use being afraid".</p><p>As of writing, Horii's comments are the only response RGG Studio have made to the backlash against Kagawa's casting in the remake. Publishers Sega declined to provide a statement on the matter when approached for comment by RPS last month. I've reached out to Sega for comment again in light of Horii's comments.</p>
<p>As of writing, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3">fan petition</a> calling for Kagawa to be removed from his role as Goh Hamazaki in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 has amassed just under 10,000 signatures. The remake is set to release later this week.</p>
