</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">filled with squishy squids</a>. These squishy squids have since come close to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">squishing Super Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Also being squished in late 2024 were some players' positive perceptions of Arrowhead's gear pricing, as a Killzone crossover arrived and was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-suitably-festive-solution-killzone-collab-price-backlash">so throughly panned for being expensive</a> that the studio ended up giving the last bit of it away for free as a make-good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of December 18th, though, the Killzone gear'll be making a long-awaited return to the shooter's store with some extra additions to help it feel fresh. This time in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">warbond form</a> for the collective price of 1500 super credits, rather than as individually-sold bits which add up to cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>If you paid for all or even one bit of this Killzone gear when it was on offer last December, this new warbond'll land in your inventory for free, with no need to re-spend any medals either. Meanwhile, if you only got the bits given away for free in 2024 or are a player who's hopped into the game since then, you'll have to fork over those 1.5k super credits.</p><p>As for what's in the warbond, the answer starts with three primary guns. There's the drum-magged StA-52 Assault rifle, the up-close killer StA-11 SMG, and the precise, charge-based PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle. Two armour sets, the heavy AC-1 Dutiful gear and light AC-2 Obedient getup, go with those and come with the Acclimated passive ability, offering 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. Finally, there are the usual capes and paints.</p>
<p>While there's no evidence it's due to arrive anywhere near as soon as this Killzone warbond, assuming it does at all, Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-little-fanfare-helldivers-2s-creative-director-shares-that-arrowhead-are-prototyping-a-roguelite-mode">let slip the other day</a> that Arrowhead have been prototyping a roguelite mode for the buggy shooter.</p>

            <p>
You know that weird chime that plays when you find a secret in the classic Tomb Raider games? Play it now in your head. You weren’t alive when those games were published? I hate you. I hate you. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VhPV3ml7U">here you go</a>.  Great, now we’re ready to talk about the leaked images of Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which appears to be the new Tomb Raider game due to be announced at G-Star K-Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Game Awards show tonight</a>. Or at least, one of them.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The leaked images come via Resetera, with posters <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/">noting</a> that Lara Croft’s pose in the supposed boxart matches her pose in the teaser for a <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1998093291594883300">“future of Tomb Raider” presentation</a> at tonight’s festive Keighley-hauling. Hello Resetera users! I read your mean comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">our best PC games feature</a>. Spare me your kneejerk Blizzard fandom, you casuals. Still, all is forgiven as long as you keep filching alleged videogame titbits from Geoff Keighley's undies.</p>
<p>The screens appear to be trailer grabs, and show a freshly-revarnished Lara sporting her legendary blue top and twin pistols. There is minimal evidence so far of the screechy Croft mutilation we saw in the more recent borderline horror survivalism-themed games.
</p>



<p>
There is minimal evidence of much personality at all, to be honest. I confess, I’ve been sitting on this leak because, frankly, the images seem rather bland and recycled, to the point that I worried they’d been AI-generated for kicks using a combination of Lara Croft character models from various generations of Tomb Raiding. Mind you, that could be because this is a remake of the very first Lara Croft outing on PS1, spliced with the look and feel of the more recent Tomb Raider reboots under Crystal Dynamics. Lara’s gear in the image certainly gives that impression.
</p><p>
There have already been two Tomb Raider reboot trilogies, plus remasters of the first six games under Core Design. Tomb Raider has pillaged itself so often I’m not sure new varieties of Lara are conceivable. Still, please accept my totally original, never before expressed suggestion: why not, like, let Lara Croft age? Instead of resetting her every 10 years because entertainment culture at large has an institutional terror of older women in action roles?
</p>
<p>
Here is my other, definitely not original suggestion, inasmuch as I think I’ve written it on these pages before: pretty please Crystal, can you do a Tomb Raider franchise soap opera in which all the various incarnations of Lara hang out in their mansion and solve mysteries? I've got personalities worked out for each of them based on my expertise in 90s television. OG Lara Croft is the Phoebe, Angel of Darkness Croft is the Joey. Legends and 2013 Croft are Monica and Chandler. Ross gets to be Lara Croft Go and Rachel can be that Game Boy one I've forgotten the name of. Look, roll with it for fuck's sake. This is still more convincing than a Croft who can't seem to grow out of her twenties.
</p>
<p>Terrible jokes aside, I hope Crystal Dynamics make this work. They've been through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">layoffs</a> in the past year. Best of luck with tonight's announcements, all.

            <p>"This game makes an expression that is impossible in reality," reads the blurb which pops up when you go to play DriveCrazy's demo. "Because it is dangerous to drive like this in real life, never imitate." "Ah," I yell as I race a kei truck down the side of a building while missiles and lava lurk in my vicinity, "I see what you mean."</p>
<p>Prompting me to give TubezGames' small lorry game a go was the fact it's just emerged from early access, having been in the oven since July 2023. Now, though, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1556010/view/565894691447373826?l=english">hit 1.0</a>, and I'm seriously considering seeing what the rest of its now-complete story has to offer.</p>

<p>The demo begins in normal enough fashion. There's a kei truck rally on, so you've got to blast your little lorry down a bunch of narrow lanes and trails in a fashion that'd make Colin McRae proud. You're rewarded technique points for clean driving, but the game also doesn't seem to mind too much if you bulldoze a few hedges or barriers without taking damage.</p><p>Then, the stage ends. As the camera fades, you see a mysterious saucer float across the sky. The next thing you  know, you're fleeing for your life through the streets of a city collapsing as aliens invade. No matter. Your truck has so much grip that it feels glued to the road, which helps in evading the missiles which menacingly float after you, the orbital strikes which attempt to get you in their sights, and the falling skyscrapers which lurch forwards across the streets.</p>
<p>Then, you turn a corner and the road's full of lava. Pants. Time to wall-ride, the game says. While your truck can take a bit of convincing to hop onto the vertical axis if you're not running at top speed, once you're racing along the windows you can nimbly jump from one side of the street to the other, skipping any gaps in the façade. It's a Fast and Furious-worthy stunt chase, but with a ride that wouldn't look out of place delivering sushi or pizza through Tokyo's backstreets.</p>
<p>In truth, I'm not sure if the level of stuntage can be taken high enough to sustain a whole game's worth of the adrenaline rush which powers the two demo levels. Then again, the Steam page mentions a battle with a giant bear and the spoiler tag in the 1.0 release notes mention, er, a large fish. So, maybe I'm fussing about nothing.</p>
<p>If you fancy finding out for yourself, you can check out DriveCrazy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556010/DriveCrazy/">Steam</a>. At only £6, it's slightly cheaper now then it will be once its 20% launch discount expires on Christmas day.</p>
