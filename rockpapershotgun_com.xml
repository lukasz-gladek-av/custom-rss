            <p>Former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté's departure from Ubisoft after 20 years in various roles was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">announced earlier this week</a>, and the developer's now put out a post in which he says that leaving wasn't his choice. Instead, Côté asserts that it came after he was asked to step aside as Assassin's Creed boss by Ubisoft as part of a corporate restructure, then offered a reduced role as part of the company's Tencent-backed Vantage Studios subsidiary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/">post on LinkedIn</a>. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice."</p>
<p>He continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years. I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</blockquote>
<p>Côté's departure came as a bit of a shock, given it followed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/assassins-creed-shadows-success-shows-that-the-threat-of-negative-campaigns-is-overblown-opinion">success earlier this year</a>, an important win for what's been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">struggling publisher</a> over the past few years. This restructure around the formation of Vantage Studios, a subsidiary created to oversee Assassin's Creed, FarCry and Rainbow Six going forwards as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a €1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>, has seen Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot appointed as its co-CEO. Yep, that's Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son Charlie, who has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">insisted his appointment wasn't just down to nepotism</a>.</p><p>I reached out to Ubisoft for comment and the publishers stuck to their statement guns from earlier this week, with a spokesperson saying: "Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft.While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build."</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," they continued. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p>
<p>Côté was also very forthright in his defense of Shadows' devs in the face of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">online vitriol over Yasuke being one the game's protagonists</a>, in contrast to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">the elder Guillemot</a>. Here's hoping that Derennes and baby Guillemot are willing to do that kind of thing, but I'm doubtful until we see it.</p>

There is a woman trying to get into my supermarket. She's banging on the sliding door glass, an urgent silhouette against swirling fog and darkness. My manager told me it's not safe outside at night, but the woman doesn't seem afraid, for all her banging. She is smiling. Not a nice smile. A Skibidi smile, all teeth and gums and painfully stretched skin. 
</p>
<p>
I do not think I should let the woman in, but she explains to me in text dialogue that I have it all backwards. <em>She's</em> not outside the store. <em>I</em> am. So really, if I let her in I'm only letting myself in. I do not find this gnomic insight reassuring. I tell her to clear off. She doesn't press her case, but comments before drifting away that there might be consequences later. I silently observe that I would rather have consequences later than consequences right now.

This is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellmart">Hellmart</a>, a grubby first-person job simulator in which you spend your days stocking shelves, cleaning the aisles and manning the checkout, and your nights attempting to secure the premises against a nebulous Evil. 
</p>

The daytime stretches are squalid and oppressive but relatively non-horrific. True, you might have to deal with paranormal antics such as self-slamming doors. True, the boxes of pasta on your shelves look vaguely like pictures of guts and eyeballs. True, the CCTV feeds on your computer by the till often reveal things that aren't there, or which hopefully aren't there. True, a lot of your customers sport that Skibidi smile, and true, it's unclear where they're from, exactly. The store sits in a waste of snow and forest, with locals emerging from behind a distant hill.
</p><p>
But that's all peanuts compared to what happens when the sun sets. I haven't progressed far enough to encounter some of the entities brazenly given away by the Steam page (and the below trailer), but it's telling that you can board up windows. The security measures immediately feel inadequate. Being able to padlock the doors is of minimal comfort, given the presence of patently xenomorph-friendly airvents. The option to hide in fridges just feels like offering yourself up as a snack.</p>
<p>The store isn't huge - it's a handbaskets-only joint, barely roomy enough to justify the supermarket label, but the head-high shelves carve it up into a larger labyrinth that is pleasingly efficient in its jumpscare potential. And then there are the people [citation needed] who bang on the glass. Some of them are probably safe company: it's up to you decide, based on the things they say.

There's been a slight trend in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> about Letting The Right One in over the past year or so. Mark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-was-terrified-of-answering-the-door-before-playing-this-freaky-faced-apocalyptic-horror-and-honestly-it-hasnt-helped">wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-im-not-a-human">No, I'm Not A Human</a>, in which you are a post-apocalyptic hermit appraising the bona fides of night-time wanderers and Visitors. There's also the earlier <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/">Look Outside</a>, in which you definitely shouldn't open the curtains, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone</a>, a chilly piece of military border policing that is hopefully alive to its own inhumanity. 
</p><p>
It's tempting to make connections with Covid lockdowns and lingering agoraphobia, but these are emotions that date back much further, of course - back through games like Papers, Please, Five Nights At Freddy's and Dark Wood to zombie fables about the possibly infected and folk legends about vampires and thresholds. The major difference I sense in games like Hellmart is that the monsters often don't particularly bother to hide their monstrousness. The ghoulish thrill of these games is letting nocturnal callers cross the lintel even when you're 70% sure they're bad news, just to see what mayhem they wreak.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Find the Hellmart demo on Steam</a>. I'll conclude with the anecdote that I used to be a Tesco store cleaner, and the scariest thing that ever happened to me on-shift was two old ladies power-dunking jars of pesto and cream at either end of the store simultaneously - the janitorial equivalent of a Double Event in Pacific Rim. Mind you, now that I've played Hellmart, I realise how glad I am that I never had to lock up after dark. That Tesco was huge. So many sightlines. Pretty sure it had a meat locker as well.</p>
<p>It's out "soon". Bulgaria-based developers Gaze in Games are a new outfit founded by a former member of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> developers Clapperheads. If you're sold on the premise and don't want to wait, there's also the lower-fi <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">Kiosk</a> from Serbian developer Vivi.
