            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/if-letters-had-pants">If Letters Had Pants</a> appears to be the product of three different elevator pitches that took place in the same elevator, and somehow resolved amicably rather than eating each other alive.</p>
<p>The first pitch was for a verbal puzzler in which you combine letters into words on a randomised grid against the clock, with the twist that words vanish when scored to create blank spaces that can be bridged by other letter combinations for higher scores. The second pitch was for a bizarrely prudish roguelite that is all about ensuring that letters are properly dressed. And the third pitch was for an archaeological excavation sim in which you exhibit things like lost floppy discs, or sell them to expand your museum. The result, against the odds, is a single and cohesive video game rather than a claustrophobic clownfight. Witness the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Here’s how the moving parts join together. The word puzzle grid is also a patch of dirt, beneath which lurk the aforesaid archaeological relics. When you combine and remove letters, you’re also lifting away the soil to expose these priceless finds. </p>
<p>Putting pants on letters, meanwhile, gives them modifiers, for use in both the archaelogical excavation and grid puzzler sides of the game. For example, you can whack some gardening trousers on the letter “W” to plant a turnip when it's removed, which grows as you combine words and can eventually be harvested for bonus score. Similarly, you’ll unlock new modifiers as you expand your museum collection.</p>
<p>Ah, wait a minute. This is sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> again, isn’t it? A roguish perma-progressioner with a touch of deckbuilding. Still, the mix of influences is quite distinctive. I like the idea that I might have to choose between a high-scoring word and a low-scoring word that’ll earn me another relic.</p>

            <p>I have a narcissistic recurring daydream that consists of teleporting historical celebrities into the present so that I can show them bits of 21st century technology and absolutely blow their tiny, primordial minds.</p>
<p>"This deceptively pocket-sized contraption is a trillion times more powerful than your silly adding machines," I would tell Charles Babbage, brandishing my smashed Google Pixel phone. "Did the Wright Flyer have wifi?" I would ask Wilbur and Orville, pushing their faces against the window of a 747. "Put this in your pipe and smoke it," I would tell Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, menacing him with the trailer for Silver Palace, a new open world action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Chinese developers Silver Studio and publishers Elementa, which is notionally set in a Victorian metropolis.</p><!--more-->
<p>Silver Palace's Victorian metropolis has red phoneboxes, elegantly appointed trams, top hats, clocktowers, detectives and ballgowns. I imagine Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could just about keep pace with all that, though he might object to the plunging necklines and the overall loudness of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>But then I would show him the angel-winged anime girls, the power-drifting panther steeds, the neck-snapping finishers, the real-time character-swapping, the demons pretending to people who must be exposed using magic profiling functionality. "Why don't your Sherlock Holmes stories have glide mechanics?" I would sternly enquire of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he curled up sobbing into his hands.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one psychic defence would be to point out that his Sherlock Holmes stories don't contain any gacha mechanics, this being a curse peculiar to our so-called modern age. Fine, Doyle, I'll let you have that one. It's not clear what Silver Palace's gacha elements involve, but here's 11 minutes of gameplay overview to give you a sense of the whole.</p>

<p>Some press release blurb to finish: Silver Palace is the tale of Silvernia, a city powered by the "revolutionary element" of Silverium. You are a Detective who must delve into a shady world of corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, and hidden monsters. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be free-to-play.  There's no release date as yet.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the overclocked character designs but I do like the looks of that urban backdrop. Hopefully the open world element is pronounced enough to allow for a Crackdown-style collectathon. Also please may I have some kind of Watson, Silver Studio? Is that catgirl maid the equivalent of Watson in Silver Palace, and if so, can you please make her as creepy as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-2007">Creepy Watson</a> in Frogwares' games?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
