            <p>
The eternal problem with online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of any flavour that has some variation on a levelling system, is that eventually you run out of room, and can't progress any more. That's why so many of them essentially allow you to reset your levels, or to prestige as it's often colloquially known. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one such game that will feature such a system, and in a new blog post, developer Embark have outlined what you get when you prestige.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon">blog post</a> discusses the game's Expedition Project, its version of prestiging, explaining that it will kick off on December 17th, running for a six-day period until the 22nd. Within this period, you can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good, as long as you've reached level 20, and you'll start from a new character with some buffs and advantages.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once an Expedition has departed, any items you have in your stash are put towards it. Every one million coins worth of value nets you an extra skill point you can use on your new raider, with the ability to earn five skill points total. Restarting with a new raider does mean that your skill tree, level, stash, workshop, crafting abilities, and blueprints will be completely reset, but you won't have to do the initial onboarding again.
</p>
<p>
In turns of some permanently unlocked bonuses, carrying out an Expedition nets you the Patchwork Raider outfit, Scrappy Janitor Cap, Expeditions Indicator icon, and +12 stash space. You also get some temporary buffs, like a 10% repair buff, 5% xp boost, and 6% more materials from Scrappy. One point to note though is that "the account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition. Bear in mind, buffs will increase in power for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!)."
</p><p>
Explaining why they're handling a progression wipe like this, Embark said that making the Expedition Project optional is their "solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game." They want to offer people a choice between accomplishing more if there's things they're yet to do, but if they're ready to move on, they can do so. Basically, start planning for what you want to do come December 17th! Happy Arc Raiding!

Video games have a tendency to be very impatient in a way that I think often makes for a worse experience. Constant rewards of many flavours push us to chase after the next challenge, there's not nearly enough games that ask us to slow down. That's why I love a fishing minigame. It is a test of patience that you cannot win by brute forcing anything, the fish must come to you, and you must wait for the right time. About Fishing, the next release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> developer The Water Museum, does ask for your patience… as well as for your willingness to embark into strange, murky waters.
</p>
<p>
Quickly into the game's demo (or playtest, as it's listed as on Steam), you are shown how to fish in a tutorial that perhaps needs a smidge more of a nudge in the right direction, but I did work it out in the end. Like in any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, the fish you're trying to nab will prod your bait, inviting your twitching finger to pull the trigger. The main difference is that the camera follows your hook into the water, and if you successfully fool a fish into taking the bait, you must reel it in, moving your mouse or WASD keys as you do so to point the fish towards your corporeal form for a successful catch.

<p>
This is a game about fishing, not a game with fishing in it, so it's much more involved than a minigame, and appropriately tactile. After catching your prey, you bring it back to a man who I think is your grandpa, who is also kind of a weird asshole. There are curly fries to be hand, it is raining, yet according to him you must fill the tacklebox.
</p><p>
So, you do your best to do so, catching everything you can until your maybe grandpa teaches you a new trick: attaching a fish you caught to your hook lets you puppeteer its dead body. And you do that too, going deep into a hole, where you find a Laura Palmer-esque dead body… and a mermaid.
</p>
<p>
This is simply the opening section to About Fishing, the first chapter of a larger game that takes its cues from both Sega Bass fishing and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, a delightful combination. There is clearly a mystery to be solved, fish to be caught, and based on the game's trailer and Steam page, townspeople to meet.
</p>
<p>
Arctic Eggs was equally as odd and concentrated in the thing it was trying to be, and About Fishing is seemingly no different in the tiny bit of time I've spent with it. You've caught me hook, line and sinker, The Water Museum. I'll be keeping an eye out on the full release, but for now you can join me in wishlisting it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3856530/About_Fishing/">here</a>.

            <p>
A new trailer for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> update, The Last of the Druids, was shared earlier this week, showing off all the cool things you can do in it! Which are mostly relegated to turning into animals, but in my eyes that is eternally a cool thing to be able to do, in a game or not. And with that trailer also came a release date for the update.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a week out now, due to be released on December 12th, just in time for the next weekend. As part of the new druid class that comes with the new update, when in human form you can wield "magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world," including summoning volcanoes, getting trees to use their roots to trap enemies, you know, druid stuff.

<p>
Then, there's the three forms you can take, that of a wolf, a bear, or a fire-breathing wyvern. Looks pretty neat honestly! Druid also comes with a couple of ascendancy classes, one being the Shaman, who "channels nature’s fury, harnessing rage to empower his spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down meteors, lightning, and ice," and the Oracle, who has "perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines!"
</p><p>
Here's the rub, however: Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release date most likely won't be March 2026 like it was previously planned for. "I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," game director Jonathon Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">Eurogamer</a> in a recent interview, continuing, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."
</p>
<p>
While there was no specific updated timeline shared, Rogers said he "certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027." I'm sure this won't be welcome news to some, but hey ho, this is just how early access is sometimes. Have patience, friend, the 1.0 will come.

Imagine a second, alternate version of our world. Everything is the same, on the surface. The sky is blue, the economy is in shambles; it's the unnatural order of things. And yet, you cannot help but feel something is different. Like there's something missing, or perhaps replaced. Ah, there it is - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</a> is not a game that even remotely exists. As it turns out, this world, our world, where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 does, or rather will, exist, is only the world we exist in thanks to the flip of a coin.
</p>
<p>
This, I would like to be clear, is not a joke. "We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'" explained Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/we-ended-up-flipping-a-coin-slay-the-spire-devs-left-it-up-to-pure-chance-whether-theyd-make-a-sequel-or-something-else/">PC Gamer</a> in a recent interview. Apparently this was during Covid, and both Giovannetti and Casey Yano were looking for their next proper project.
</p>
<p>
According to Giovannetti, a Slay the Spire sequel wasn't the only idea they had. "We had different paths we could work on," he explained. "One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on it, and the rest is history."
</p>
<p>
The coin flip itself isn't something Giovannetti witnessed first hand, it was Yano that did it over a Discord call, which the former notes was "maybe questionable," but he still believes he was told "true result. I think Casey would've massively preferred the coin went the other way, because I was always the card game person, and he was the action game person."
</p><p>
There is nothing more joyful, to me, than seeing the creator of a thing engage in an exercise that is so directly tied to the kind of thing that they make. In this case, it is Mega Crit playing with that fickle game called chance, in the hopes that it will work out, that they will, if they're lucky enough, slay the spire. But maybe don't do this if you aren't literally the folks who made Slay the Spire, this isn't a point in history to be taking unnecessary risks.
</p>
<p>
Slay the Spire 2 is currently slated for release on a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-a-secret-thursday-in-march-2026-alternate-acts-teased">secret Thursday</a>" in March 2026, where you'll be able to play it in early access. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">here</a>.
