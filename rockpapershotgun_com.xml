            <p>
A thing I find a lot of joy in is the fact that despite there's technically a new, shinier, perhaps by some people's standards better version of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> is still kicking around. Before the Old School was tagged on the front end of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> was an MMO I put many hours into (and found little success in) as a youth with too much free time, so the fact practically two decades later it's introducing a brand new skill into the game simultaneously impresses me and strikes existential fear into my heart because of how old this game actually is.
</p>
<p>
Moving on swiftly, sailing! That's the new skill coming to Old School RuneScape, the first new one since its launch. According to a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1">blog post</a>, sailing is quite the undertaking, described as "bigger and more expansive than any content that's come before it," and a skill that "touches almost every aspect of the game." With this new skill, you can own up to five boats at any time. These boats are upgradable, and there's three sizes to choose from: the raft, small boat, and large boat.

<p>
There's ship combat, which apparently mostly works the same as land combat, and you can also take a few different NPCs with you out on the sea - or your real friends too! Levelling up requires, technically, just one thing, which is, well, sailing. This includes "interacting with facilities on your boat" like trimming your sails, an action that nets you some XP as well as a speed boost.
</p><p>
On top of all that, you can salvage shipwrecks, chart the oceans you travel across, do some deep sea trawling, complete new quests, gather new resources, and while this one's a bit more secretive, there's new areas to explore too, including 30 new islands, some of which have some new dungeons.
</p>
<p>
The sailing update is coming to Old School RuneScape pretty soon too, as it's currently planned to launch in just under a month's time on November 19th.

      <article data-ads="true" data-article-type="news" data-article-group="news" data-paywalled="false" data-premium="false" data-sponsored="false" data-type="article">

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>This is the game's second delay</p>

    </div>

            <p>
There are two sides to every game delay coin. On the one hand, it's a shame when you're looking forward to a thing only to have to wait even longer for said thing. On the other, there's too many damn video games these days and, oh, gods, don't we all just have a laundry list of things to attend to right now? So make of it what you will that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a>, the cyberpunk restaurant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> set in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloudpunk">Cloudpunk</a>, has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Word of said delay (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/glittering-cyberpunk-life-sim-nivalis-has-been-delayed-until-2025">its second one</a>) comes in the form of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/536616765394782627?l=english">Steam news post</a>, which took the time to highlight just how big this technically small indie game actually is: "Right now, we’re deeply focused on the voice over: we’ve just completed the casting process for over 100 new voice roles after our first casting of 32 roles for our demo 2 years ago," the post explains. "In Nivalis, there will be around 135 primary and secondary fully voiced characters, for a total of about 200,000 words."
</p>
<p>
That, to be clear, is genuinely very impressive. We all know how even the biggest of RPGs reuse voice actors for multiple characters and NPCs. With that, the post notes that amongst all of this voice acting stuff, "releasing the game in 2025 would risk compromising its quality." So the game will now be releasing in 2026, though an exact release day or even month hasn't been revealed just yet (apparently the devs are working on this with their publisher, and confirmation of a release date will hopefully be coming before the year is out).
</p>
<p>
Nivalis, for those that haven't heard of it, conceptually feels like quite an open game. You can manage a restaurant or a night club, buy or grow your own ingredients for your establishment, go fishing, purchase a home, and most importantly meet people. It's the meeting people that almost seems to be the key thing here, and the thing I'm most curious about.
</p><p>
The game's Steam page does note that Nivalis is not an easy city to live in, with gangs hoping to harvest your organs, Corps fining you just for breathing, and "the whole time, the ground under your feet is crumbling." So in a world like this, what are its people like? With as many voice lines as the devs claim the game has, hopefully these people are varied and strongly defined, but I also want them to be people with believable problems, wants, and needs.
</p>
<p>
Like many of us in this world I worked in hospitality for many years, and met all sorts of folks, which sometimes was even quite a nice thing to do. It was also often not a nice thing to do, a dichotomy I hope is represented in Nivalis, whenever it launches next year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/">here</a>.

            <p>
You know, with the original Paranormal Activity steadily approaching two decades of existence, it's becoming harder and harder to recognise what it actually was and is as opposed to the cultural consensus around it. First and foremost you probably think of it as a cheap, jump-scare-filled kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> movie, when in actuality the first entry in the series is a slow, tense window into the world of gaslighting and, obviously, the paranormal. Being as removed as we are from this means one thing: IP expansion, which we're viewing today in the form of the first proper trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paranormal-activity-found-footage">Paranormal Activity: Threshold</a>, the video game adaptation from the developer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mortuary-assistant">The Mortuary Assistant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let's set the scene, with some assistance from the game's description on Steam. Paranormal Activity: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threshold">Threshold</a> focuses on Daniel and Jessica Stewart, who've just decided to remodel their first home. We're introduced to said home by Daniel, showing a fairly sized if sparsely decorated building that he describes as the only one they could afford. Sure thing Daniel!

<p>
The rest of the trailer shows a variety of hauntings and happenings like a shadow moving across the room, a stool sliding along the floor, a door suddenly shutting. There's some kind of vaguely satanic-looking puzzle you can do, but aside from that it doesn't really show much of the broader activities you'll be participating in.
</p><p>
Returning to Steam again, there's an explanation that you can "play in multiple timelines," "hunt and communicate with entities," and "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate." There's apparently multiple endings, and the game's "Paranormal Engine makes every playthrough unique." My guess is that different playthroughs can have different hauntings as I described above take place randomly, which if I'm right, sounds quite similar to the hauntings you can experience in Silent Hill 4's pseudo-hub area.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit that I feel quite apprehensive about Paranormal Activity getting a game adaptation. I can count the number of good entries in the film series on one hand, but there's two hands worth of films to count, distorting what it could be if done well. How might a game adaptation deal with such a framework? Is a game even capable of capturing that tactile feel an actual tape presents like in the first film, having you question what's real and what isn't? I'm not sure that there's enough filters in the world to convey such a feeling.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date for Paranormal Activity: Threshold, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3394030/Paranormal_Activity_Threshold/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
Last month, something a bit surprising, and perhaps concerning, took place in the games industry: a deal was made which saw that a mixture of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners had privately acquired EA. There's a whole host of reasons why this is worrisome, but one reason in particular is the way that it might affect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it isn't exactly a paragon of identity politics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> has by and large been a game that welcomes and encourages people of all creeds, notably LGBTQIA+ folks. It is probably safe to assume that these new owners, however, will not be so welcoming. In fact, concern has been so great over this acquisition that the biggest Sims YouTuber around lilsimsie has <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6?si=sglHvJEekR-fr1md">left EA's Creator Network</a>, having been joined by other big Sims YouTubers like <a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53?si=OTATMfwD8usqaILA">Plumbella</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=4KaoEumB9X0jgD7u">James Turner</a>.

In turn, a message has now been shared by The Sims team on its official Dwitter account seemingly attempting to assuage some of the above concerns, though it has been delivered in a bit of a vague tone. "We're continually inspired by our incredible players and creators; by your imagination, creativity, and the joy you bring to The Sims every day," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply respect that everyone experiences The Sims in their own way and will make choices that are right for them. However you choose to play, create, or share, we’re grateful to be part of your journey. Our mission, values, and commitment remain the same. The Sims will always be a space where you can express your authentic self."
</p><p>
The statement carries on with an even vaguer bit about how everyone's "passion and voices" have affected bits to come in 2026, and that on November 4th there'll be a new update coming to The Sims with "150+ fixes and fresh freebies." Notably, this update is "the first of ongoing updates that address the things that matter most to you," though personally this feels slightly disconnected from the main message and is more addressed at those who are frustrated with how broken the game often can be.

<p>
This is all well and good for now, it's just still a bit too early to tell what kind of effects this acquisition will have. For now let's all just cross our fingers for the future of any staff members currently working at EA.
