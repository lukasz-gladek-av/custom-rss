            <p>Gah! I've lost them again. My precious brows and burns, they've gone walkabouts! Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> latest patch aims to take care of instances of misbehaving hair. That's far from the only fix in what's a very beefy list, with companion buffs, crash corrections, and instances of weird NPC antics also having been tended to. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The near 5000 words of bullet points which make up Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-patch-1050">patch 1.0.5.0</a> make for surprisingly fun reading, with as many fun bugs having been squashed by Obsidian as serious issues. "The player's eyebrows no longer disappear when using the inventory screen or idle camera," was the first note which caught my eye, followed by: "The player's eyebrow color will now be properly saved and applied to their in-game characters after character creation. Note: this unfortunately will not retroactively fix incorrect eyebrow color for existing characters."</p>
<p>Tragedy. Pour one out for all the space adventurers who're stuck explaining why the brows don't match their blonde, brown, or black barnet until the end of time. The hair-raising fixes don't end there. Obsidian have "made adjustments to side burn facial hair so that it no longer disappears at certain angles". Great relief for those roleplaying as American civil war generals or Victorian businessmen.</p>
<p>Getting serious for a moment before I shout out a bunch more wacky ones, Obsidian have fixed a couple of issues which could prevent saving and generally "increased Companion survivability", meaning that they should be more effective especially on harder difficulties and if your leadership skill's high. A number of crashes and scenarios that could see NPCs get stuck have had failsafes put in, while characters should "no longer unexpectedly take explosive damage through walls or objects". Companions should now properly follow you through vents and not get stuck wanting to talk to you when they've got nothing new to say. The studio have also nixed some references to cut content which were causing errors.</p>
<p>Right, more silliness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the Order of the Ascendants members were found to be having conversations with each other at very long distances on Cloister, this wasn't part of the grand equation and has been addressed</li>
<li>Preventing your VALERIE unit from 'beep bop booping' into Ladders if you have climbed it</li>
<li>Player arm doesn't freak out anymore after sliding into a forced cinematic or conversation</li>
<li>Marisol is no longer able to teleport to the rooftop of Scientician's Surplus and enter a problematic state</li>
<li>Characters will no longer make noises before they have been spawned into an encounter</li>
<li>Player can no longer sprint while being mentally refreshed</li>
<li>Glued shoulder pads back onto our 2-handed handgun users so they no longer fly</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice.
