Announced just now at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma - The Frozen Compass</a> is a wintry 3D action adventure in which a tenacious young buck and his dog get stranded on an Arctic island. The key thing to know is that it's a co-op game, a co-op <em>splitscreen</em> game, if you please, which means that you and your friends must decide, right now, which of you will play the dog. 
</p>
<p>
This game is described as "a powerful story of love, loss, and endurance", which doesn't bode brilliantly for the dog, so whoever dons the collar needs to a great tragic actor. I encourage you to spend a few weeks rehearsing the business of lying bloodied in the snow next to a dead yeti, whining heroically at the back of your departing owner, who has decided he's more of a cat person anyway. Come now, let me see your expression of puppy-eyed anguish. There's a nice juicy biscuit in it for you if you can make me cry.

<p>
If you don't have a friend willing to be a dog, the good news is that in Ikuma, you can switch between characters in solo play. Caught between realms, at home in neither: the ultimate nightmare. Each character has unique skills with which to conquer different obstacles. The dog ain't so hot at rowing boats, while the human is less competent at fitting through dog-shaped holes.
</p>
<p>
There appear to be elements of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> here, glinting at us menacingly through the ice. "Use the tools and items you gather on the island to find your way and overcome rough terrain," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728620/IKUMA__The_Frozen_Compass/">explains the Steam page</a>. "Climb, fish, gather resources, do what it takes to get yourself and your companion to safety." You also have to worry about ancient Inuit legends, and the mystery of a lost expedition. "Retrace their steps but beware of what's lurking within the fog that cloaks their path," the Steam page cautions. 
</p>
<p>
Fog, eh? That sounds like the kind of clinging, spectral mist a dog might run barking into, only for the barking to suddenly end in an agonised whimper. How's your abject whimpering? Carnegie Mellon-worthy? Again, you might want to get in some practice. Honestly, I'd love to play the dog but I'm probably going to corpse it and yell something like "oh fuck, a giant werewalrus". 
</p>
<p>
Ikuma - The Frozen Compass will release in 2026. Developers Mooneye Studios are the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/claw-wing-and-swim-through-lost-embers-forgotten-world">Lost Ember</a>, in which you get to play a whole menagerie of critters, from moles to parrots.

            <p>I was all primed to ignore Void/Breaker forever based on it being pitched to me as a roguelite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which you "escape an endless cycle" and "craft infinite weapon variants" in order to "forge deadly synergies". I joke, I joke. There is, of course, no way of ignoring the roguelike and/or roguelite genre in this, the year 2025. We are all caught in the endless cycle of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> or roguelite releases, doomed to forge synergy after synergy until whatever software our universe is secretly running on finally blue-screens. Bet it's Windows 7.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Void/Breaker, I overcame the above feelings of crushing hopelessness and watched the trailer. My feelings about the game are now more specific, and optimistic: this is a game about flaying entire skyscrapers in half with a piano-white shotgun while peering at vaguely fractal, megalithic horizons and other set-dressing that reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>. It's absolutely not Returnal, but it haunts me in a similar way. Those backdrops bode. Here's the trailer.</p>

<p>The developer is Stubby Games, aka Daniel Stubbington, creator of The Entropy Centre. We never managed to review that, but James liked the demo enough to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">feature it in a round-up</a>. "As much as this first-person puzzler borrows from Valve's masterpieces (especially the overgrown lab environments from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>'s opening hour), its demo suggests that it can successfully transplant the thrill of solving a test chamber while using a brain-bending central mechanic of its very own," he wrote.</p>
<p>Odds seem fair Void/Breaker will have something of the same cerebrality. For one thing, there's some kind of hostile AI running the show behind the scenes. "The machines think you'll never escape," comments the Steam page. "The system is designed to keep you here." I imagine the system wouldn't have given me guns if it thought I could shoot my way out, so perhaps you'll do something brainier between the firefights. Perhaps you'll sweep up all the buildings you've just murdered and arrange the fragments into an SOS.</p>
<p>I'm not judging you if you just want to stick around and murder buildings, mind. I like murdering buildings too! Void/Breaker launches later this year, and there's a playtest happening... right now. It runs till 24th April. You can find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2615540/VOIDBREAKER/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in 'game pitches that would keep you reading a novel if they were the first line' is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a>, a horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with life sim bits from Coldblood Inc. Burnt out from years working a dead-end job, Fiona (and I'll quote this directly because it's the blasé single sentence that did it for me) "starts over on a farm and becomes the immortal herald of a dead god". Lovely stuff. Cucumbers. Carrots. Cthulhu. City slickers will say it's fake, but we've seen the punchline to this whole cosmic joke, squirming between the beets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Quick. Hit it. Hit the punchline with combat inspired by Zelda: A Link To The Past. Then, retire to the farm for the evening. You can advance time whenever you want, moving through a "slow-burn horror story" told in cutscenes inspired by Mother 3. Make friends. Maybe date them. Craft things. Catch fish. Maybe date the fish? Not clear. "Unlock combat abilities through friendship bonds". Farm. Do it all while listening to noises by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper</a>'s Martin Kvale and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>'s Disasterpeace.

<p>Coldblood Inc. themselves are a triumvirate of illustrious play weavers, with artist and designer Pedro Medeiros having worked on Celeste and Towerfall, and coder Isadora Sophia having built the open-source 'Murder Engine' on which the game is built. In the same way that owning, say, a very nifty synth is a good way to convince yourself to learn piano, I predict that a non-zero amount of people will learn to make games, simply so they can say they're fluent in the nuances of the Murder Engine. Neat.</p>
<p>Neverway is self-published with funding from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>'s Outersloth. Release is still TBA. The answer, my friend, may be squirming between the beets.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Excellent dwarven miner-shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a> has been quiet for a while, but only because devs Ghost Ship Games having been putting the wrenches to its upcoming roguelite spinoff <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a>. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk_oE3OFVp8">last week’s teasing</a> of some of the 'Reclaimer Tech' that Rogue Core’s bearded delvers will wield, we now have a meatier, action-heavy trailer showing how that kit can be put to use against rampaging xenobeasts.</p>
<p>The trailer, revealed during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a> livestream, also end with the announcement of a closed alpha playtest, which aspiring battleminers can sign up for via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">Rogue Core’s Steam page</a>. And that’s not the only DRG news to emerge, dusty and covered in alien bits, from the showcase, as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> was confirmed to launch out of early access on September 17th.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">I like Survivor a lot</a>, but Rogue Core looks to stick far more closely to the co-operative sci-fi shooterin' of DRG Classic – fully destructible caves included. The dwarf classes are all new, mind: there’s the Slicer, an aggressive melee fighter, the defence-focused Guardian, the Spotter, who can soften up beefier targets, and the Falconeer, who commands a winged attack drone. In each run you’ll be hunting upgrades and new weapons while scrapping your way towards a lost excavation site, so I guess it makes sense that you can't just take DRG’s Driller and dig your way down there in a nice neat tunnel.</p>
<p>These new Reclaimer dwarves each get their own high-tech gauntlets, which sound like souped-up takes on the original game’s support tools. The Guardian’s Stonewall Repulsor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a>, for instance, can not only throw up a protective shield – so far, so DRG Gunner – but also punt enemies off cliffs with a kinetic blast. The Slicer, meanwhile, gets a big old energy sword, which is a big old energy sword. Fair.</p>
<p>I was slightly worried, watching that teaser for the mostly-offensive Reclaimer Tech last week, that Rogue Core might shift aside DRG’s exploration and traversal facets in favour of a simpler killfest. This new trailer does calm those nerves by throwing in some mining and navigation bits, and I spy at least one zipline, so hopefully the pleasures of mastering your spelunking tools come through just as strongly as the thrill of exploding an interdimensional cave monster with a power fist. Also, it seems like some of the environments go heavy on abandoned mining infrastructure, and if there’s one thing I love exploring in games, it’s the decaying ruins of a once-prosperous industry that now stands only as crumbling monument to the builders' hubris.</p>

<p>As for Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, that has a trailer of its own, running through the additions it’s made since its early access launch last year: new biomes, new bugs, mutators and suchlike. There’s obviously still some time before its 1.0 release in September, though the trailer also hints at some upcoming upgrades that could arrive before then, including a buffing can of legally distinct WD-40. Presumably it’s not as useful and powerful as real WD-40, or else spraying it would defeat all the baddies instantly while tripling the game’s framerate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
