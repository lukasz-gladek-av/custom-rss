<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyclopean-the-great-abyss">Cyclopean: The Great Abyss</a> appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a>-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?
</p><!--more-->
<p>

For now, I must wander the catacombs in pitch blackness, navigating by way of the minimap and the sound of my character walking into walls. Sometimes I walk into a ghast, Dark Sentinel, or other Lovecraftian hoodlum. I'm sure the monsters are hideous but again, I can't see them, and the turn-based combat sound effects are oddly cartoonish - generally, it sounds like I'm punching a snowman. I realise "never show the monster" is a cardinal rule of horror, but I think you're allowed a peek when the creature is munching on your face.
</p>
<p>
Oh how I wish I could see the monsters of Cyclopean: The Great Abyss, because this feels like a promising cosmic horror game, not least because it's also a minimalist, mildly sandboxy exercise in retro RPG mechanics - hardly "cyclopean" at all, but certainly enticing.</p>
<p>It casts you as an English aristo of some kind who has dreamt their way into the Great Abyss, and must search for a way back to the Waking World. You begin by rolling your stats and equipment - a really rubbish dagger and some protective rags, in my experience. Then off you trot to get your soul sucked by a Moon Beast. The overworld appears to be fixed, but I've encountered different dungeon layouts when revisiting the site of my previous character's death. Beasties aside, there are doors with pickable locks, treasure chests and, best of all, spike traps. I have triggered many a trap in my time with the demo. Fortunately, you can't trigger them repeatedly.
</p><p>
Cyclopean came out in early access this month. The current build supports the core elements of combat, stealth and dialogue. It can be played from start to end with three potential endings. All going to plan, the 1.0 version will launch in six months and feature more elaborate quests, more elaborate NPC interactions, and a more elaborate sanity system. I haven't had a chance to see what happens when you go insane because I can't see anything and I keep stepping on spikes and I keep dying. It's hard to descend into madness when you have all the base survivability of a mosquito in a microwave.

Developers Schmidt Workshops are, in fact, a single person from Chicago, Illinois. Their past creations include Islands Of The Caliph, "an old-school inspired action RPG based on Middle Eastern folklore and Islamic spiritual tradition". Given that precedent, I'm curious about how they're going to navigate the usual problem here of Lovecraft being a big smelly racist. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958790/Cyclopean_The_Great_Abyss/">find the demo on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-games-workshop">mp1st</a>.</p>
<p>News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a â€œmultiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report speculates that the cancellation was due to Games Workshop themselves deciding to "withdraw funding", although to my knowledge GW don't fund games so much as rent out their license for residuals. The project's publisher isn't named in any of the materials shared, though CCO Daniel Erickson does mention another company's change of "strategic direction" in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-aidan-erickson_over-the-last-three-years-at-thought-pennies-activity-7264324075357941760-nQCJ/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post</a> made last November in the wake of layoffs at the studio:</p>
<p>"Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals," wrote Erickon. "Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding. Last week we had to shrink the size of the studio."</p><p>The "three years" Erickson mentions does line up with the resume dates from the report, two of which list 2022 start dates on the project. Here are the relevant bits from the report, which I've verified with my own RPS nose and eyes and fingers.</p>

<p>Exactly which of Games Workshop's universes the Warhammer game took place in is unclear. The 'fantasy' setting mentioned in one of the posts could suggest either Age Of Sigmar, or Warhammer Fantasy in either its classic or newer incarnation, The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-world">Old World</a>. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-company-looking-for-the-next-one-after-big-success-of-space-marine-2">a recent money-me-doo</a>, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree made it clear the company is "looking for the next one", "one" here referring to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. I love business, man. You can just get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them that your strategy is to find another thing that makes you a lot of money. There was a bit more, to be fair. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games," spoke big daddy plastic. "We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
