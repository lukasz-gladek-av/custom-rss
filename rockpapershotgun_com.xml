            <p>It's the open environments of tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/every-day-we-fight">Every Day We Fight</a> that have most caught my eye. Huge warehouses, bases, and ruins so stuffed with cover and walkways as to suggest the dominant species on the game's pre-alien invasion earth were sandbag piles. These sprawling layouts aren't just for show or getting a nice height advantage, either. The city is explorable between battles with your gang of resistance members, letting you poke around and scavenge before sneaking into optimal positions for the next scrap against invading aliens.</p>

<p>My own personal reaction to realising I'm trapped in a time loop would be the Bill Murray approach, i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/dTbGzGQCe-o">inserting large slices of cake</a> into my mouth, to the audible disgust of Andie MacDowell. Here, you'll be using it to your advantage by learning the location of useful discoveries for subsequent runs. These roguelite bits also make themselves known through a sort of push-your-luck heat meter, where subsequent fights get tougher and enemies more numerous, but also offer better rewards.</p>
<p>The executive producer on the game is YouTube tactics man ChristopherOdd, who I credit for making me markedly less rubbish at XCOM many years ago by offering the simple but transformative advice to prioritise finishing off aliens over everything else - the thinking being that one stray shot from one lowly sectoid can feasibly still kill your best guy. Good advice! Here's him narrating <a href="https://youtu.be/UGywygR2oLA">the game's feature overview trailer</a>. I should also point out how much I appreciate this kind of calm, epic strings-free explanation of what a game actually is. Good trailer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrival of the Rifters brought the world to a standstill, but life goes on for your fighters. Uncover their checkered pasts as they learn to work together. Unveil the mystery of the alien invaders and their control over time as you fight through the streets of a once-beautiful city to reveal the full truth about the war. Your resistance grows stronger with each success, and with each failure â€“ after all, death is only the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every Day We Fight should be on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546080/Every_Day_We_Fight/">Steam in early access</a> by the time you read this, unless you've somehow snuck in the RPS content management system, in which case: get out! The lingering scent of bumeggs and Peter Monyleux squirming is ours to enjoy alone.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publishers-time-loop-tactics-rpg-every-day-we-fight-is-out-today-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sometimes it's fun to just do things that don't make sense. Especially in a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that generally rewards you for embracing the chaos and behaving a manner that'd leave onlookers scratching their heads and slightly afraid.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's one immensely satisfying bit of action those who play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> as a tadpole-slupring hypocrite have, to the best of my knowledge, been unable to get in on since November 2023. No longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">BG3 modders</a> have stepped in to save us from the scourge that is logical decision making.</p>

<p>This is your warning that the minor spoiler gun is about to be fired. Remember the scene when The Emperor offers you a nice tadpole to eat, and you can choose whether to accept that gift or politely decline? Well, there's also the option to unleash your inner drama demon, chuck the Illithid worm on the ground, and stomp on it.</p>
<p>It's cathartic, a bit harsh on the virtual slug, and something any unhinged character worth their salt would go for in an instant. Sadly, all the way back in 2023, Larian opted to use <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-4-now-live_96">the game's fourth patch</a> to ban <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/17sw69a/no_option_to_stomp_the_tadpole/">folks who've already consumed tadpoles</a> and embraced their worm powers by that point in the game from picking the stomp option.</p>

<p>It makes sense. After all, if you're already on the pro-tadpole train, why would you stomp on one to prove just how against inhaling them you are? That's logic, though. My RPG runs, whenever possible, are not bound by the science of reasoning. I lurch from one choice to the next, unpredictably gravitating towards whichever option takes my fancy, no matter how badly it meshes with my earlier choices.</p>
<p>Enter '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17485?tab=description">Stomp that Tadpole</a>', from modder whatsontheflip. It lets those of us who've been "slurping down tadpoles on the regular" randomly decide to engage stompage, either freely or provided we can pass a level 14 constitution check.</p>
<p>Squish. A squid guy wondering just what you actually stand for, if anything at all. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. Bliss. You will never know my true intentions, purple fellow. I am the great stompy slurper, and I am beyond your comprehension.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/attention-massive-baldurs-gate-3-tadpole-hypocrites-this-modll-let-you-get-stompy-for-the-first-time-since-2023]]></content:encoded>
