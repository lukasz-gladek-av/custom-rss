Every year, the fruit flies and mosquitoes return to my kitchen, drawn to the illicit aroma of unlidded pasta sauce and the rank embroidery of carbonised toast around my cooker. Every year, I attempt to remove them non-violently by building intricate traps out of vinegar bottles, or performing slow-motion kung fu punches with a jug.</p>
<p>My inability to keep the winged hoodlums at bay has alienated me from my so-called friends, but on the plus side, it has also equipped me to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mosquito-gang">The Mosquito Gang</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer affair in which one, regular-sized human player attempts to carry out various domestic tasks while four, tiny mosquito players attempt to suck their blood.

The Mosquito Gang is my favourite usage of the term "extraction" game in a while. As one of the mosq, you must obviously try to land on the human player without attracting their attention. Any mammalian essence extracted in that time can be spent at a blood bank to unlock random new abilities and modifiers. The blood bank mechanic is not a faithful representation of mosquito feeding habits, but does create a useful interval between extracting blood and profiting from it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the abilities are, exactly, but one of the screenshots shows a mosquito driving a toy car. The mosquitoes also appear to get side objectives, like unplugging fumigators and turning on a music player. Again, I must sternly object that this is not typical mosquito behaviour. A mosquito does not have the muscle power to operate a steering wheel. You'd need to be a horse fly or larger.
</p>
<p>
The human player, meanwhile, has to carry out chores that range from the ordinary - taking out the trash, preparing a meal - to the Madly Scientific - operating a DNA scanner, mixing a cocktail for a robot. You earn cash for completing jobs, which can be spent on useful implements such as bug swatters. There doesn't appear to be a pacifist mode, but I would love the option to trap the mosq in a jar and stand next to it for 20 minutes doing the floss. As for mosq objectives, perhaps they could add one where you maintain a just-audible presence near the ceiling, then suddenly whine right by the human's ear as they're falling asleep. Always a hit round these parts.
</p>
<p>
I'm a fan of Big vs Little in multiplayer games, and while this doesn't seem quite as high octane as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, I can imagine it being a holler. Perhaps it'll teach me the real trick to staving off the annual kitchen invasion. People have suggested doing the washing-up more often but that feels pretty extreme, very much a last resort. The Mosquito Gang is slated to launch sometime this year. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2811100/The_Mosquito_Gang/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards Of The Coast have apologised for "mistakenly" sending a legal takedown to the creator of a free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod that adds a village inspired by and featuring characters from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The mod has attracted praise from Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who was naturally a bit piqued when it was taken offline.</p>
<p>Published on Nexus Mods on 16th March, the Baldur's Village mod in question was taken offline days later and placed "under moderation review". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13511816-dmca-request-issued-by-wizards-of-the-coast-llc/">According</a> to a Nexus Mods staff member, legal firm Reynolds Law PLLC sent a claim of copyright infringement on behalf of Wizards on 27th March.</p>
<p>The mod has now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">been restored</a>, following a player backlash, so go ahead and marry pixelart Astarion as you please. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">PCGamer</a> also have a statement from Wizards, who claim the strike was one big whoopsie.</p>
<p>"The Baldur's Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly - we are sorry about that," it reads. "We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!"</p>
<p>It's possible this has something to do with Vincke's intervention yesterday. In a predictably popular post on the Muskvine, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">wrote</a>: "free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth. Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.</p>
<p>"Protecting your [intellectual property] can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled," Vincke continued. "There are good ways of dealing with this."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">said</a> in their fan content policy that they're fine with people making mods based on their games, as long as they give them away for free, don't pass them off as Larian's own work, and don't do anything "inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging". Larian are not, however, the legal custodians of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world in which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> takes place.</p>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is informally set after the Larian RPG's ending, so beware spoilers if you're planning to install. Again, it's free, though the modders do run a Patreon. Given enough interest and crowdfunding, they hope to flesh out their chunk of the Forgotten Realms with further BG3 callbacks.</p>
<p>"Our next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline," the Nexusmod page FAQ explains. "Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the "capacity to entirely reallocate them", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," said management in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/?originalSubdomain=fr">the post on LinkedIn</a>. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>
<p>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</p>
<p>The company doesn't specify what that "mandate" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">not-our-fault spinlingo</a>. The statement says the axed workers are "going to enter the employment market" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.</p>
<p>"Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development," they added.</p>
<p>The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">cancelled a Deus Ex game last year</a>, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. </p>
<p>Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers</a> across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">process of "restructuring" was over</a>. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">closure of the Gothic developers</a>, the axing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">139 people from a Diablo IV support studio</a>, and just last week other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-and-perfect-dark-devs-crystal-dynamics-cut-staff-promising-that-current-projects-are-unaffected">layoffs at Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
