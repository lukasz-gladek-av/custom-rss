            <p>My husband died in a horrible toilet accident. Also, I'm distantly related to Ronald Reagan and spend summers in an underwater chateau. These aren't just very true facts about the author of this article, they're things you can tell the reprehensible billionaires of the future in Better Than Us. It's the latest work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">Vampire Therapist</a> developers Little Bat Games, and it's set to arrive in 2026.</p>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, Better Than Us casts you as a master thief whose goal is to infiltrate the swanky parties of the year 2200's richest bastards and manipulate them into looking the other way as you swipe some of their stuff. There's some stealthing, but as you might expect of a game that lists The Count of Monte Cristo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, and the works of Terry Pratchett as prominently among its inspirations as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, your words will be your most formidable weapon.</p>
<p>Lying is key, but you've got to do it properly. "Tell different stories to different people," the game's blurb reads. "Remember who you told what. Build a web of deception so intricate that even the powerful can't see through it. But slip up once—contradict yourself, forget a detail—and everything unravels."</p><p>For all its setting in futuristic floating cities built to save their wealthy inhabitants from the climate change-ravaged Earth below, Little Bat Games make clear that this isn't a cartoonish flight of fancy. Better Than Us' Steam description reveals that it's been "developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida". The game "deals heavily with issues of extreme wealth inequality and faith. It explores philosophical underpinnings of class oppression, effects of climate change on underprivileged populations, and refugees. It also addresses sexual and gender issues, artificial intelligence, and faith in historical contexts".</p>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues," Little Bat creative director and voice actor Cyrus Nemati says of the studio's approach. "Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios." He and fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> alum Sarah Grayson - the pair voiced Ares and Selene respectively - lead Better Than Us' cast.</p>
<p>As someone who loves a good bit of stealth and weaving wordly webs in the likes of Pentiment, if Little Bat can strike that balance in entertaining fashion while offering plenty of freedom in the way you go about prying the possessions from a set of faithfully-rendered fat cats, I can see myself having a ball with this one.</p>
<p>For now, Better Than Us has a 2026 release window and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3954390/Better_Than_Us/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.

            <p>Look lively, me hearties. There, cast your eyes starboard. Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced PEGI rating ahoy. The fair winds have seemed to be blowing our sails towards Ubisoft's long-rumoured remake or remaster of the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, the one that's all piratey, for years at this point. At last, it seems, we may be on track to slide our hull into its port.</p>
<p>Our compasses have endured much flitting between different directions, buffetted by the rogue gusts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">voice actors saying a thing</a> and many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports also saying things</a>. The seasick landlubbers among us may indeed finally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">breathe their sigh of relief very soon</a> after all, it would seem.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That said, if you're hoping this <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">freshly unearthed listing</a> on the Pan European Game Information ratings board's website is awash with details about Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced, you're going to be disappointed. Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">YouTuber Corkben</a>, the listing's naught but a name, an indication that you'll have to be 18 to play this Ubisoft-developed game, and a selection of reasons that rating's been applied.
</p>
<p>Violence, bad language, and the most piratey of all infractions: in-game purchases. Some combination of the same trio adorns <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-bz8nbznbz_F9jMJ_MJXFYGrsaKZAZWOHaA9gS6afh1Y&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">the listings</a> of all the other Assassin's Creed entries, though those have some additional blurb about platforms and release dates that the Black Flag Resynced rating is currently missing. The timing might suggest a a formal announcement at this Thursday's Geoff Awards, something that'd seem to mesh with recent reporting alleging a release early next year.</p><div>

<p>This year's seen plenty of Black Flag remake chatter, regardless of Ubisoft continuing to remain tight lipped on the subject, as they have since such a project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">first reported to be in the works</a>. Back in September, French publication Jeux Vidéo Magazine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">claimed</a> that Ubisoft Singapore, Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are involved in putting together the remake. The magazine also asserted that this Black Flag revamp will ditch with the original's modern-day Abstergo office-wandering segments for some cut content featuring Mary Read. The likes of inventory and combat mechanics have reportedly been tweaked to more closely mirror recent entries Shadows and Valhalla.</p>
<p>So, hoist the main sail! We're headed for remake-laden land at last. Or just an island covered in fools' gold.</p>
