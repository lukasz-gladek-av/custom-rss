            <p>
One of the nicer Industry Trends of the past few years has been the rise and rise and rise of climbing sims. It turns out climbing is a source of many emotions, from the melancholy wonder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> through the savage loneliness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> to the slapstick camaraderie of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> and the agony of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-a-game-about-eternal-punishment-and-frustration-is-tired-of-playtesting-it">various Sisyphus sims</a>. Also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. And I guess we should mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> here? See, it's an absolute avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is on the somber side. Created by The Game Bakers, it's about a woman with bandaged legs and a scuttling robo buddy. She's trying to reach the top of a mysterious mountain, with a selection of routes to choose from and a backpack inventory to manage. I get the sense that there's more up there than goats, snow and the tents of fellow climbers. We will find out shortly, for Cairn is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">on sale now on Steam</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Nic (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-the-demo-for-heavy-breathing-open-world-mountain-climber-cairn-now">impressed by the Cairn demo</a> back in December 2024, even though the leg animations gave him funny emotions. Fortunately, Nic's funny emotions make for entertaining reading.
</p>
<p>
"No graceful, contextual, restrictive animations for Cairn," he wrote. "No sirree! You'll also be carefully balancing your supplies, and using pitons as quick checkpoints as you make your ascent. You'll be thinking about things like posture, effort and balance while climbing. 'Each wall feels like a boss fight,' says Steam. Do...the mountains do the spinny FromSoft thing? I'd love that."
</p><p>
I do wonder how much of today's flourishing climbing genre is a delayed reaction against the success of Assassin's Creed - the game that 'fixed' videogame climbing back in the noughties by transforming it into a fluid spectacle of semi-automated ledge grabs and cornering. Remember videogame climbing before Assassin's Creed? It was all vikings doing pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake at murky vine textures. Still, there's only so many synchronisation towers you can auto-parkour before you want to get your fingertips dusty again.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is another change of tune for The Game Bakers, hitherto known for the nimble RPG snogging of Haven and the gimlet-eyed boss-rushing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a>. Also the *squints* cephalopoddy eco activism of Squids Odyssey. What will they bake for us next? A martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant? It's a martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant, isn't it. I am giving The Game Bakers 24 hours to deny this, before I write it up as a news story.

            <p>After years worth of all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">the other thing</a>, they've just randomly decided now's the time to acknowledge it. Via a Tweeter reply containing that GTA: San Andreas meme no less. I may be a weathered old sailor with cannon fuses tied into my beard and more trips up the rigging than I can count to my name, but I didn't foresee this being how Ubisoft finally acknowledged that Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's what they've done, though. Years of silence, and then like a well-timed broadside, boom:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Why now, in response to a seemingly random bloke selling an Edward Kenway-shaped plastic trinket on Vinted? Well, a man of the sea can only assume the publishers' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a>, which reportedly included the Black Flag remake being pushed back into the financial year ending March 2027, factor in.</p>
<p>Those have been quickly followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">redundancy plans</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">unions calling strike action</a> against Ubisoft, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">real</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-just-as-if-it-never-existed-following-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-remake-cancellation-actor-discusses-losing-three-years-worth-of-work">toll</a> taken on folks lives rightly taking precedence over chatter about a pirate game.</p>
<p>Perhaps this just the way things have to go these days. The sobering reality of workers being chucked into the sun punching you right in face. Then, when you open your eyes again, the surreal sight of a corporate social media account finally tipping its cap to a long-rumoured remake's existence ages after it'd have made sense to do so is there. Immense and unforgiveable brutality, intercut with the promise of goods people might treasure conveyed in a manner so strange you can scarcely believe. Yo-ho. A pirate's life indeed, I guess.</p>
