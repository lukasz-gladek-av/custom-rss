        <p>About 400 other Blizzard workers voted to do the same earlier this week</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a busy week for union organisers at Activision Blizzard. Yesterday, in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a group of over 100 developers that work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> and the mobile only strategy game Warcraft Rumble voted "strongly in favor of wall-to-wall union representation." This comes after around 400 Blizzard platform and technology workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/around-400-blizzard-platform-technology-staff-are-the-latest-microsoft-workers-whove-voted-to-unionise">voted to unionise</a>, also with the CWA.
</p>
<p>
The union is made up of numerous roles such as quality assurance testers, artists, designers, software engineers, and producers, having been particularly inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> devs that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">voted to unionise last July</a>. Organising committee member and game designer Dominic Calkosz said in a statement, "My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals. We chose to organise in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore."
</p>
<p>
Not that there's ever a bad time to form a union, but you can easily understand why these devs are putting in the work to do so right now. From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">entire, massive game cancellations</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">sweeping layoffs at Microsoft</a>, to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">policy changes</a> that might as well be more layoffs, it is not a secure time to be a game developer right now. Big solidarity to the newly unionised workers.
</p>
<p>
Also worth mentioning as part of ongoing internal tensions at Microsoft is its offering of its Azure cloud services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the country's military enacts its invasion of Gaza. The contracts related to these specific services were <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">recently cancelled</a>, but Xbox <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians">remains a target of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement</a>. For more on how the game industry remains connected to this ongoing issue, you can check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">this piece from Edwin</a> where he spoke with various game devs and tech workers about it.

            <p>
I think if you were to travel back in time to around the 14th century to wherever Dante Alighieri was at the time, and showed him <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-maiden">Hell Maiden</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, bullet hell, deckbuilding, '90s anime-esque, essentially fan fiction sequel to his Divine Comedy, he'd probably say something like "Mama mia" and die on the spot in fear of what his own creation spawn hundreds of years later. Yet as ridiculous a concept as it is - and it is ridiculous - the demo for it is quite good.
</p>
<p>
To compare it to other games, Hell Maiden is like a mash-up of Hades and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, the latter leading the charge in moment-to-moment gameplay. You play as Dante himself, or in this case, herself, who is back in hell after having reached Paradiso, with amnesia. And so she begins the ascension to heaven once more!
</p>

<a aria-label="Hell Maiden | Gameplay Trailer" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/90EaQ4buCC8?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>

<p>
When you start off, you're armed with Dante's quill, which sends out fiery blasts every second or so akin to Vampire Survivor's whip. You can have up to four weapons (at least that appears to be the limit in the demo), said weapons represented as cards. Leveling up gives you the opportunity to choose from three new cards, which most of the time will be weapon modifiers, doing things like adding more projectiles, increasing damage, that sort of thing, but you'll occasionally get new weapons to use.
</p><p>
If you pull a duplicate modifier card, you can fuse them with another to improve it, or place it on a different weapon if you so choose. There are even some cards that can affect multiple weapons depending on where you place them. 
</p>
<p>
Like in other Vampire Survivor clones you don't have much control over your attacks, though you can point them in one direction while moving in another, so you do have some control. This feels solid too, at no point did I feel frustrated or overwhelmed by what was on screen, I know each of my deaths was my own fault. It's all quite tightly woven together, especially impressive considering that whenever the game does launch it'll do so in early access.
</p>
<p>
The Hades element crops up in the form of narrative structure more than anything. Upon death you're brought to The Forum, a hub area where you can hang out and chat with various Poets of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, such as Homer, Virgil, and Horace. It seems that befriending them lets you unlock other starter weapons, and they all allow you to pick up different weapon and modifier cards too.
</p>
<p>
All of this is wrapped up in an incredibly well rendered vaguely '90s anime art style, at least when it comes to the dialogue scenes. The rest of the game is mostly pixel art, but there are special moves you can use that do screen-wide damage following some stellar, fully animated cutscenes showing off these anime girlified versions of, I would like to remind you, very real poets.
</p><p>
For the most part just mashing up genres, even if it's done well, doesn't inherently colour me interested in a game, but with its extremely well realised concept, I am currently sold on Hell Maiden. I just hope no one invents time travel so Dante doesn't die sooner than he was meant to.
</p>
<p>
Hell Maiden doesn't have a release date just yet, but when it gets one, it'll launch in early access. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372060/Hell_Maiden/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <p>
It's been a while since we've last seen anything FIFA in the world of video games, namely because EA took a gamble on saying goodbye to the sports association's official licence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-officially-ditch-fifa-and-will-rename-the-series-ea-sports-fc-from-next-year">back in 2022</a>. Whether that has paid off, literally, is neither here nor there right now though, as FIFA announced this week that it has signed a "multi-year partnership" with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager</a>, once again bringing its recognisable (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32897066">if potentially tainted</a>) name back to video games.
</p>
<p>
Well, technically this is the second FIFA game connection since the EA split, seeing as earlier this month it also revealed <a href="https://youtu.be/qKWU52Et1ww?si=CDiUYE_OJLJ0nC8I">FIFA Heroes</a>, but that one's just for phones so we can ignore it for now. In any case, this particular deal sounds like it will go into effect pretty soon, as there'll be official licences for things like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fifa-world">FIFA World</a> Cup, the Women's World Cup, and Club World Cup.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-and-fifa-sign-multi-year-partnership">blog post</a>, all this FIFA stuff will be coming as part of a "playable, revamped International Management module," coming to Football Manager 2026 sometime next year, ahead of the World Cup itself - that kicks off (pun intended) the middle of June, so this update will at least be out in the first half of the year. Said blog post also notes that kits for all 48 of the participating teams in the world cup will be included, as well as some broadcast graphics and tournament branding.
</p>
<p>
Is any of this particularly necessary? Probably not, but it does show that FIFA is still quite interested in having a games presence. Time will tell if that recent, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">internally controversial</a>, private <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buyout of EA</a> will see EA Sports FC get its old name back.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2026-will-be-coming-home-soon-enough-with-a-november-release-date">due out next month</a> on February 4th.

            <p>
Like whatever genres you like, but for me personally, I find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformers</a> to be the quintessential video game genre. Even with the most challenging entries, there are very few other genres that (when done well) are as easy and quick to pick up, play, and have fun with. I think that's why so many of them have such longevity, one such game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/n">N++</a>, a tough but fair platformer that's celebrating its 10th anniversary with a new update.
</p>
<p>
Available now and appropriately titled TEN++ (as if there was any other choice), it's quite a simple update: more game! Which translates to more levels across the game's solo, co-op, and race modes. For solo there's two new level sets, titled "?!" and "!?" respectively, with co-op and race getting one level set each, both titled TEN++. In a trailer announcing the update, developer Metanet Software said that there's "no way anyone 100%'s it… for real this time!"

In a <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/2025/celebrating-10-years-of-nplusplus">blog post</a>, the devs got a bit candid about working on N++ too, saying that "by 2018, we were very burned out, having worked tirelessly on N++ over 6 years. We took a little break - but the thing is, we always come back to making levels. Those of you who have tried it may understand; it’s just fun to do, and somehow there are always new ideas to be uncovered." Subsequently, over the years, they've kept making more levels, having "rediscovered what is so special about this game," thanking the game's community for its enthusiasm in helping them do so.
</p><p>
Oh, and there's another bit of good news too: Metanet Software have started development on their next game. They're keeping quiet about it for now, but you can <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/newgame">sign up to hear about it</a> (and potentially play its beta) further down the line.
</p>
<p>
And if you've never played it before, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/">it's currently less than three quid on Steam</a>, an offer that's hard to turn your nose up at.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> is honestly not a game I expected to still be going for as long as and as strongly as it has. It came out in 2022! That was practically a decade ago, at least in games industry years, and yet here is developer Massive Monster showing off the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> next big expansion, Woolhaven. There's no release date other than an early 2026 release window, but a new trailer did at least show off all of that farming you'll get to do. Or, I guess get your cult to do.
</p>
<p>
The big theme for this expansion, as you may have gathered from the name already, is winter, that pesky incoming season those of us in England will inevitably complain about after having complained about the heat all summer. This particular trailer hones in on the new ranch and the steps you can take to deal with cold, harsh weather that stops your crops from growing as well.

Namely, you can raise animals, which includes things that look like goats, cows, crabs, snails, turtles. You can raise them from birth, breed them, even name them, and after all that you can shear them for some resources, or carve them up for Sunday dinner. Makes naming them just a little bit more difficult, but this is a game where you run a cult, if you take issue with slaughtering an animal for sustenance and not that, I would have questions.
</p><p>
You do also need to make sure they get fed, cleaned, protected from predators too, and there's the option to take them on a walk or ride on them. Over time and levels you can get your followers to attend to these duties, or even get a best animal friend of their own. This part I find quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
Like many sim games of its ilk, the ultimate goal is automation. Take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a game where given enough time, you'll get to a point where you don't even need to tend to your own crops anymore, freeing up your time for more leisurely activities or even bits of story.
</p>
<p>
Woolhaven comes with a couple of new dungeons, so I imagine this loop of building up your ranch as you go on more adventures works similarly to the rest of the game. But I am curious to see if there's any kind of direct commentary on the ever popular, and ever growing, farming sim genre, seeing as you have a whole cult to dictate.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's apparently more reveals to come for Woolhaven, but in the meantime you can look forward to playing it early 2026.
