            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders continue to dig deep into the bag of tools Larian gave them and unleash their creativity on mods which don't just remix existing bits of the game, but add entirely custom elements. While custom campaigns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">new areas</a> rightly grab a lot of the headlines, custom companions have also been starting to arrive. The latest is a "cowboy wizard extraordinaire", a vocation that'll fit right in among the established party.</p>
<p>After all, people will likely be too busy staring at Withers' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8738">modded big naturals</a> to question whether cowboys are a thing in the Forgotten Realms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This conjuring cattlehand is called Jason Altea, and according to his creator Magnetuning was actually the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10086">first custom Baldur's Gate 3 NPC to be given proper custom voiced dialogue</a>, back when modders were initially working out how far they could push messing around with the game's dialogue system.</p>
<p>He's now morphed into a fully fleshed-out party member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10000?tab=description">released in alpha form</a>, with around 200 lines of custom voiced lines and a range of interactions that'll make him feel like a proper member of the base game's crew, right down to getting involved in some of their chats. Altea also has his own quest, custom gear, spot in most camps, and the ability to approve or disapprove of your actions. He also comes with a sewing kit that can modify gear to match his unique body type.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4928">ability to edit hirelings</a> has long been the easy way of making yourself a fairly rudimentary custom party member in BG3, as far as I can tell this might only be the second fully-blown new party member to arrive on Nexus Mods. Modder Queenplouton's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13529?tab=description">The Bloodletter</a> is one, but aside from that, most of what I've found in a quick check have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12257">revolved around existing characters</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3415">animal familiars</a>. This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18415">chest with teeth</a> may also count.</p><p>"Consider him in Early Access for the moment," Magnetuning wrote of Jason. "Some things in this initial release might be subject to change over time, he might not have as much reactivity as you'd expect yet, and you might run into bugs or edge cases I haven't accounted for. I put a list of known issues below, but please let me know if you run into anything else!"</p>
<p>They add that since Jason's an existing character they've previously written a <a href="https://herotune.itch.io/far-from-the-tree">visual novel</a> about, he's taken a bit of crowbarring into the established lore. So, maybe not one for the DnD purists.</p>
<p>If you fancy making orb bloke peeved by recruiting another wizard, the requirements to get this mod - dubbed A Candle In The Dark - are as follows: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8295">AV Item Shipment Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16649">ImpUI_P8_Fork</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/353">P4 Patches</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457">Tutorial Chest Summoning</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, it's time to get ahead of the game. Approach your router and force it to repeat the things Lightning McQueen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaYn0541ro">says about speed</a> at the start of Cars, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a launch patch coming and it sounds like it'll be weighty. EA say "over 200 changes" will be dropping as part of it and have also teased some potential future additions in their latest beta learnings post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">said community update post</a>, EA said these 200 launch day tweaks are "focused on bug fixes, balance improvements, and polish for release". As a result, movement should feel more responsive, while the recoil of automatic weapons will be rebalanced and various gadgets have been tweaked.</p>
<p>Also among the list of changes the publishers have revealed here ahead of deploying the full notes on release are layout revision for Rush and Breakthrough maps "for better balance between attackers and defenders". Some improvements to the game's netcode should also "reduce desync, make time-to-death feel fairer, and address cases of invisible damage". Personally, I don't feel the time-to-death'll truly be fair until a person can live their entire natural lifespan within a Siege of Cairo skirmish, but this'll do for now.</p>
<p>While EA have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">already announced the stuff they'll be adding over the next few months as part of the shooter's first season</a>, they did also cheekily tease the potential return of some other features down the line. "Requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more," they wrote.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>That's far from the only observation EA have made through 92 million-ish hours of beta testing. They plan to offer both single and mixed mode playlists, but note that "players favoured playlists with combined modes". They said that "there were no differences of note" in terms of time spent battling in open weapons playlists vs closed ones, but found that players tended to stick with the former once they'd tried both. "This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," EA declared, but noted that closed playlists will still be on offer at launch.</p>
<p>So, Call of Duty-style freedom in terms of weapon choice for different classes getting more of the spotlight, rather than the more traditionally Battlefieldy emphasis on running with the specific gun type your class is aimed at excelling with. The publishers also add they didn't spot one particular weapon type becoming dominant in terms of pick rate, instead saying things were "well-distributed", which is promising for the variety of bullet you're shot by each match if accurate.</p>
<p>There we go. Now the final few days' wait for Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">full launch on October 10th</a> begin. If you can't stand five minutes without shootering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">ongoing beta</a> will <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">run until October 9th</a>. It's like the two are trying to form their own mixed playlist.</p>
