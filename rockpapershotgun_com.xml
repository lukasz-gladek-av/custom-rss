            <p>A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of "hateful or extremist" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve "bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards" or risk "intense scrutiny" from the government.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=958CB1AD-0C0D-4254-96B4-2C82494C0C5E">the letter</a>, Democrat senator Mark Warner argues that Valve's content moderation doesn't meet industry standards, and says he wants Valve to "crack down on the rampant proliferation of hate-based content".</p>
<p>The exact hateful stuff he's talking about was highlighted in that <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/millions-examples-extremist-and-antisemitic-content-found-steam-new">report by the Anti-Defamation League</a> last week. Its many findings include swastikas in profile pictures, antisemitic images such as the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/happy-merchant">"happy merchant"</a>, and instances of Pepe the frog, a meme appropriated by the far right that - let's be honest - has never washed the stink off. Steam is "inundated with hate" as a result of these findings, say the anti-discrimination group. 

</p><p>While the simmering bubbles of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">fascism</a> won't be news to the average Steam user (or average internet user, to be frank) that doesn't mean we ought to get complacent about them. It's proof, says senator Warner, that Valve is lacking good moderation.</p><p>"Until now, Steam has largely not received its due attention as a de facto major social network where its users engage in many of the same activities expected of a social media platform,” said Warner. "It is reasonable to question how committed Valve is to effectively implement and enforce Valve’s own, self-created Conduct Policy for its users," said the senator.</p>
<p>It's true that Steam does have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct/">conduct policy</a> but (as the original report from the ADL notes) it's limited to things like unlawful behaviour, sexually explicit content, copyright violations, and threatening or abusive language. The ADL make clear their desires, saying they want Steam to adopt an explicit anti-extremist and anti-hate policy of some kind, and to enforce that policy properly.</p>
<p>"The wide breadth and sheer volume of hateful and antisemitic content on Steam is mind-boggling," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. "Steam’s parent company, Valve, needs to make significant changes in terms of policy and practice to address this shocking proliferation of hate."</p>
<p>The searching for hateful content was done using help from an AI tool called "HateVision", which scanned the groups and user profiles on Steam for specific hatestuff, including "39 key potentially extremist and antisemitic symbols". The ADL has written up <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">a methodology for how the findings were compiled</a>, if you like to read that sort of thing. </p><p>Meanwhile, the senator's letter claims that the US Senate has previously complained about this back in 2022, but says that Valve didn't respond adequately back then. According to Warner, the games company has continued with "a ‘hands off’-type approach to content moderation that favors allowing some users to engage in sustained bouts of disturbing and violent rhetoric..."</p>
<p>"As Black Friday and the holiday buying season approaches, the American public should know that not only is Steam an unsafe place for teens and young adults to purchase and play online games, but also that, absent a change in Valve’s approach to user moderation and the type of behavior that it welcomes on its platform, Steam is playing a clear role in allowing harmful ideologies to spread and take root among the next generation," says Warner.</p>
<p>His letter also includes a set of questions designed to hold Valve's feet to the fire about all this. He asks how many human content moderators work on the Steam community, for example. He also asks how many complaints Valve have received over the last ten years which fall under a breach of the conduct policy. And what the company intends to do over the next year to improve their moderation. He wants an answer by December 13th.</p>

            <p>Joining the rare but always brilliant category of “games that sound like someone scratched the high concept into their arm at pub closing time with the sharp corner of a Frazzles packet” is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/Assassinvisible">Assassinvisible</a> - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game about an invisible assassin that’s so invisible the player doesn’t know where they are. True, games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375750/Invisigun_Reloaded/">Invisigun</a> have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:</p>

<p>This one’s going to be very quote-y, because I’m still trying to wrap my head around it myself. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207460/Assassinvisible/">Steam page</a> describes Assassinvisible thusly: “A cute bite-sized puzzle and stealth game that takes place in the margins of a bored pupil's notebook. You're an invisible assassin, sneak your way past the guards to reach your target and erase it!”</p>
<p>The idea, as far as I can tell, is that you’ll track your own movements through the hand-drawn puzzles one square at a time, trying to reach your target and take them out. Through the framing, you’ll also learn more about the student drawing you. Here are the features, which themselves feature the word ‘complexifying’:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn levels (that the kid made, certainly not us) with ever complexifying, unique and interesting situations -absolutely no filler.</li>
<li>An original gameplay where the character is invisible for the enemies, but also for the players!</li>
<li>A touching story told through a pupil's notebook.</li>
<li>Your ultimate revenge for all those years spent being bored (and having fun) in class.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>It’s from French studio Zaatar Café, and it’s out on the 13th of December. Until then, the studio have a few smaller releases on Itch.io you can <a href="https://zaatarcafe.itch.io/">find here</a>. My favourite of these is ‘the elusive portal snake’, which Zaatar Café didn’t design, but recreated from memory after a previous mash up of Portal and Snake they played on Itch got deleted. Storied!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As per a recent update to their FAQ page, The Game Awards have confirmed that DLCs, new game seasons for live service games, and other such releases are eligible for their game of the year award.</p>
<p>The FAQ itself - which appears to have been accessible over the weekend but now links to a ‘coming soon’ page - says the following. Thanks <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-game-awards-will-now-consider-dlc-and-remasters-for-all-its-award-categories/">Neowin</a> for quoting it in its entirety:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><strong>Are DLCs, expansion packs and remakes/ remasters eligible?</strong></p>
<p>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>For this year, this means that releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">The Silent Hill 2</a> remake or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> would be eligible for the GOTY category. A win for either would mean the first time The Game Awards’ GOTY went to anything other than a full release. Previously, things like well loved expansions have factored into, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> winning ‘Best Ongoing Game’ last year, no doubt in part to its excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> DLC.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake"> Resident Evil 4</a>’s remake was also nominated in the GOTY category last year.</p>

<p>Whether you feel this is an understandable decision given the quality of some expansions, or change that only further benefits a few obvious favourites at the expense of more interesting titles, I’ll leave that up to you. Whoever wins, I lose anyway: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> will doubtless get no love. Plus, Alice Bell (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">already summed up the Games Awards better than anybody</a>, imo. Hey ho! Reveals are nice at least! The nominees themselves are being announced later today at 9am PT/12pm ET/5pm GMT.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
