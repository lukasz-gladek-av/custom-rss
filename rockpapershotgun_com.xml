            <p>
The purpose of a Tamagotchi is to have a tiny, portable digital pet with you at all times that you can feed and feed and feed until it grows into something slightly bigger, different, a new creature almost. It's generally a sweet, albeit potentially irritating (the beeps…) little micro-game that may cause a touch of stress, but certainly no feelings of fear. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-full-bloom">In Full Bloom</a>, however, asks "what if your Tamagotchi was actually a blob of an organism with nothing but a mouth that you must continuously feed… or else…"
</p>
<p>
The Tamagotchi connection to In Full Bloom is an explicit one, the '90s classic toys are directly mentioned on the game's Steam page. Yet instead of finding the likes of Mametchi, or Kuchipatchi, or Ichigotchi, you just have… "the mouth." This mouth is, maybe, I'm not sure, something akin to an amoeba? Or really a lump of flesh adorned with nothing but a single orifice it uses to consume whatever you place inside of it. This, in its totality, is the game.
</p>
<p>
You take your mouse, you click and hold on an object with the left button, bring it to the mouth's mouth, and release. And bit by bit it grows. And you start to notice changes. Those dents, is it forming eyes? Right there… it has teeth now. More teeth. More teeth. Even more teeth, a dentist's nightmare amount of teeth. It continues to get bigger too, so you must feed it larger and larger objects until… well, I'm not sure. There's a demo available to try, but it only goes so far, though judging from the game's page it can get as big as a planet.
</p>
<p>
There is admittedly not much game here on a technical level. Yet it still makes for a deeply uncomfortable experience. Some excellent sound design fuels the sensations from dread as you contribute to this thing's growth. I was left with a few questions from the demo too, particularly around who I am meant to be if there is a person feeding it. Neat stuff! I won't sleep tonight! If you'd like to join me in the night terrors, you can try out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">here</a>.

            <p>
Other opinions about the storefront aside, the Epic Games Store launcher, on an experiential level, sucks. I'm not just being needlessly mean here, because this is the exact word Epic Games Store vice president and general manager Steven Allison used in a recent interview about the launcher, where he also detailed what you can expect from it over the course of the rest of the year.
</p>
<p>
"We have a lot of things we need to fix," Allison told sibling site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-launcher-sucks-lets-call-it-what-it-is-epic-game-store-boss-says-promising-a-year-of-big-improvements-to-speed-new-forum-type-social-features-more">Eurogamer</a>, going on to say that the company has "needed to fix them for years. We've been really focused on developer tooling and all the things we do there. But last year, we finally started to point more of our resources towards player experience stuff, all the things that our players have needed, wanted, and all critics rightfully take us to task on. We got a lot of stuff out the door last year, and this year is going to be probably the best year for that stuff on the 'big rocks'. And the big rocks are: the launcher sucks. Let's call it what it is. It's really slow."
</p>
<p>
Apparently work on the architecture of the launcher started in November 2025, with speed improvements set to arrive for users around May or June this year. "It should start to feel good, be faster and people be like, 'Holy shit. It doesn't suck so much.' And that will be a win for us," Allison said.
</p>
<p>
It's not just a speedy store that Epic are working on. Right now, it has zero real social features, a stark contrast to Steam's framework where each game comes with its own community hub and discussion pages. According to Allison, Epic are planning to add what they call "community spaces" to the store with things like avatars, player profiles, private messaging to cross-platform text chat, and voice chat, all of which should also be coming around May.
</p><p>
At some point in 2026, Epic will also be testing "a kind of forum-type experience," though details beyond that are scant. Probably a safe bet to say it'll just be a version of Steam's discussion pages, but I suppose we'll find out later this year!

            <p>Despite any PR babble you might have heard about 2025 being the "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/its-the-year-of-obsidian-the-outer-wilds-2-game-director-says-the-studio-isnt-worried-about-releasing-another-rpg-in-the-same-year-as-avowed/">Year of Obsidian</a>", the studio have admitted that putting out three games in the course of 12 months isn't something they're keen to do again. Sadly, two of those games - mushroom-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and space capitalism-encusted RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> - haven't managed to hit the sales targets corporate overlords Microsoft assigned them. As it stands, Obsidian say they're keen to do more in the fantasy world of Eora, but aren't working on an Outer Worlds 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> blogger Jason Schreier, Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart said the two RPGs landing below those marks have left the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take". The latter already looks to have been decided, with Obsidian hoping development timescales can be sliced down from the six years both Avowed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> took to a leaner three or four.</p>
<p>Not having them all of the games come out in close proximity's also a goal. "Spacing those releases helps the company manage its resources and not burn everybody out,” studio design director Josh Sawyer admitted. "It’s not good to release three games in the same year. It’s the result of things going wrong."</p>
<p>As for where Obsidian have landed following a year of putting out big RPGs with Grounded 2 sandwiched between them, the answer is a next few years in which they plan to focus on unspecified new games, plus additions for both The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2.</p><p>As of writing, Bloomberg report that the studio explicitly plan to keep making games in the Avowed/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe of Eora going forwards. Things seem more murky when it comes to the future of The Outer Worlds series, with the report simply saying Obsidian aren't working on a third Outer Worlds. I've reached out to Obsidian to double check whether that's confirmation the studio aren't planning on ever making a third Outer Worlds, or just that they aren't in the process of doing so right this second.</p>
<p>Personally, I'll be a tad disappointed if this does turn out to be the end of the road for The Outer Worlds series, at least for now. As much as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">I liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, I do still think there's potential for Obsidian's advertising jingle-filled interpretation of the cosmos to deliver something special if it were to get another entry, regardless of whether that something ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">being New Vegasy</a> or excellent in its own way.</p>
