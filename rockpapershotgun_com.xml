            <p>
Much like many of you, I suspect, I too would love a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored</a> 3, but I'm not entirely confident it will ever happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">Arkane Austin was obviously shut down last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-deathloop-team-are-making-a-marvel-blade-game">Arkane Lyon are making a Blade game</a>, which leaves little room for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> sequel. But is there any possibility of one happening all the same? Well, still no, probably, but Arkane Studios founder and Dishonored co-creator Raphaël Colantonio did recently say that he could at the very least see himself working on a follow-up.
</p>

<p>
While on an episode of the Quad Damage Podcast (thanks for the heads-up, co-host Robert Yapp), Colantonio was asked if he'd have any interested in bringing back working on Humanhead Studio’s version of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. The developer expressed disinterest in working on someone else's games (don't forget Arkane's Prey just uses the name), but he did say this about a potential Dishonored 3: "I'd love to - I mean, we're talking totally hypothetically at this point - I could see myself working on Dishonored 3 right now because it's been so long that, you know, why not?"

<p>
Like all glimmers of hope, there was a caveat, as he noted "after Dishonored 1, the last thing I wanted to do for the next four years of my life was Dishonored 2. In general I like to create new stuff." 
</p>
<p>
None of this exactly screams Dishonored 3, but Colantonio did also say that both he, fellow Dishonored creator Harvey Smith, and current Arkane head and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> director Dinga Bakaba all have their own documents about their own ideas for a sequel. "I don't think it would make sense to talk about it," Colantonio continued. "Which of those three versions will ever see the day, now we're talking about science fiction at this point. So many of the people [that worked on the series] are scattered around, and Harvey is not at Arkane any more. I'm not at Arkane, and Dinga is working on Blade."
</p>
<p>
So, there you have it. All the people formerly in charge of and currently in charge of Arkane all have ways they could take Dishonored 3, except none of them really have the ability to do it at this point in time. It's a shame Arkane likely won't be working on an original game any time soon, even if Blade looks cool, but I'll still keep my fingers crossed that something fresh - or even a Dishonored sequel - makes its way out eventually.
