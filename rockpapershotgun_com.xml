I guess the simplest way to describe Jitter is that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>, the hectic spaceship hijacking game from Suspicious Developments, but you are the spaceship, not the hijacker, and also, you can glue pieces of other ships onto yourself, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>, and also, this looks a bit like Lemmings on the Game Boy. Boil that down, and we have a brand new subgenre, the Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike, which... let's maybe forget I wrote the words "Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike". Let's proceed without further reflection to this video showcasing the combat.

If the above description confuses and alarms you, there's a cleaner one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/">the game's Steam page</a>. "Jitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt," it reads. "You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents."
</p>
<p>
Cue impressive scenes of your greenish top-down AI core chewing through asteroids like a lemming through a baguette. Shoo, lemming! That's my lunch, not an asteroid, and since when do lemmings eat asteroids, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
No time for lunch, though, because it's time to talk about simulation systems. As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a>, you'll organise the generation and flow of power and oxygen around your craft as you expand it, ensuring that you still, for example, have the means to swiftly fix hull breaches while adding gun turrets to the design. It might sound like it requires a shedload of menus, but the largely mouse-based controls are quite simple for a game of this fiddliness. There's a demo on Steam, if you'd like to try for yourself.
</p><p>
If the idea of playing an AI seems dry, may I draw your attention to the line above about your crew. It consists of named humans with fetching character portraits and bespoke abilities. You'll shepherd them through boarding actions, opening airlocks and tactically clicking rooms to have them survive against greater numbers. Beware: if you lose one of the story-critical ones, it's game over. This seems to rule out the possibility of being an Evil AI, alas, though there's definitely scope for venting the odd humanoid in a fit of cybernetic pique. 
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Jitter, though it's a bit too processing-intensive for my work laptop, with all manner of physics-enabled celestial body bouncing around the playing field. There's no release date yet, but developers Berko Games posted in June that they're now focussing on "the final major updates before our Early Access release".</p>
<p>Their practical difficulties include living in Ukraine, a country that has been fighting off a Russian invasion for three and a half years. "It's not easy working under drone and missile strikes, but your attention and support should remain focused on the game itself," the developers comment briefly in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2877660/view/541108949283242521?l=english">a recent update</a> about the game's NPC vessel behaviour.

            <p>February 1st, 2021. Until yesterday, that was the last time Ubisoft had posted anything on the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman</a> Tweeter account. That outstanding streak has been broken because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platforming series</a> has turned 30, promting the publisher to reaffirm that a team of devs is still busy working on Rayman's future, with news to come, er, not very soon.</p>
<p>Before you shout at me for writing about a games company posting that, yes, they still plan to make video games in the future, this is also a chance to highlight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGyqe1t_JU&amp;t=2s">Rayman Alive 2025</a>, a pretty hefty community showcase of fan projects helping to keep the aged limbless being's legacy alive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an appearance at the end of that fan-run event, Rayman producer Loic Gounon and composer Christophe Heral did all the thanking you'd expect, while also providing that brief update on Raymond Man's status. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman," Gounon reaffirmed. "Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>Heral then whipped out a rather delightful banjo and delivered some sweet tuneage while Rayman stood on a plant leaf next to him, blankly staring into the void. Ubisoft added that the likes of exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes dev interviews will be put out in the coming months.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>ðŸ‘Š ðŸŽ‰Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy ðŸŽ‚ðŸ¥³</p><p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p></div>â€” Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Anyway, this served as the climax of Rayman Alive 2025, which is organised by <a href="https://x.com/VnheardVoices">Vnheard</a>, creator of unofficial Raymanimated series <a href="https://x.com/Rayman_SL">Rayman: Scepter of Leptys</a>. There were cameos from a whole host of Rayfan projects throught the showcase, including Rayman: Origins mod <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/617018">Ales Origins</a>, fan comic <a href="https://x.com/clairiphi/status/1962604349277843650">Rayman Nightmarish</a>, and <a href="https://raymanbeatbox.tonocatmeow.com/">Rayman Legends Beatbox</a>, the latter of which you can fire up in your browser and have Rayman shred some fat bass guitar riffs as you work.</p>
<p>There's a full list of featured projects in the description, and as ever with these sorts of community showcases, there's a chance you'll find something you dig in there. Hey, given how long it might be until Ubisoft do a Rayman tweet again, the Rayfans'll need it.</p>
