            <p><a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">The Crew Unlimited</a>, a fan project making Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, released yesterday, September 15th. There's been some early issues to rectify, with the developers having put out two hotfixes already and emphasised that they're "not responsible" for any problems caused by people having grabbed "broken/corrupted game files" from "shady sources".</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">reported earlier this month</a>, The Crew Unlimited's devs started working on it not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play"> pulled the racer's official servers offline</a> in March 2024, rendering it unplayable. Cue a group of fans deciding to set up a server emulator that'd allow them to get it up and running again for players who still had the game files installed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon opening up its gullwing doors yesterday, the project quickly ran into some teething issues. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1107329778396172348/1417303193984962570">an announcement on Discord</a> early this morning, project lead whammy4 revealed that the team have performed "over 10 hours of non-stop tech support" out of the gate, and it looks like the majority of the issues have affected folks who didn't already legitmately own The Crew's game files via Steam prior to grabbing The Crew Unlimited.</p>
<p>"It has come to my attention that a lot of you have acquired (by whichever shady methods...) broken/corrupted game files," the developer wrote. "If you have acquired the game files from shady sources then we are not responsible for whether your game works or not. Players with legit Steam copies have had by far the least issues, no wonder. Also, to those who expect swift 24/7 around-the-clock support for them and them personally - I don't want to say rude things in announcements."</p><p>Prior to the project's release, its developers had acknowledged via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ page</a> that while they wouldn't be distributing any of The Crew's game files, "as long as you manage to run the game files, we have absolutely no way to tell a legit copy from a non-legit one, so we just have to let you in."</p>
<p>Around that announcement, the team have put out a number of fixes. The first, a launcher update called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417254654672113735">version 1.1.0.0</a>, fixed the default save "disappearing and preventing the game from logging you in", as well as some DateTime string errors. It also added an 'Apply' button to the cheats section in the hopes of averting some "interface confusion".</p>
<p>That update's been followed by two hotfixes. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417310879262965870">Version 1.1.1.0</a> stopes a default 'TCUPlayer' profile being automatically created and save game names being left blank, while <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417332986105430066">version 1.1.2.0</a> rectifies the player being automatically given the username, er, "UserName" instead of the default 'TCUPlayer' due to "a logic error in the launcher" if you clicked play straight away.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but my defining memory of The Crew is not being able to get the Artic Monkeys' 'Do I Wanna Know?' out of my head, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure I wanna know if it's as overplayed in this fan revival.</p>
