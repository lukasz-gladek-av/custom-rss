            <p>The map masters who make the madcap map mayhem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> have made more maps for maladjusted mates to mop up their misgivings in machinegunning map-bound mockery. The magnificent maraud 'em up has mustered 37 more maps a mere month after the mapsters mapped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">a further 35 maps</a> into the multiplayer mix-up, meaning that by my map math the myriad maps now measure 263 - much more than many mainstream grudge match manufacturers may have mapped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Ahem. </p>
<p>The maps were mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/523090111361976393">major map update</a> that immersed new maps, mechanics and murder machinery into the muzzle misfiring must-play. The makers of the militaristic manshoot have moreover made a stun mine as a means of mystifying your miffed matchmate.   </p>
<p>There's more to mull over. The minicity of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> now manifests as a multiplayer metropolis, a map which may emerge in your memory as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">the murky municipality in the magnificent muckabout</a> of the aforementioned moniker (my most memorable moment was mounting the motorbike).</p>
<p>Another minor modification sees maps maximise movement with a mini marathon, a "Racing System" that may amass more malevolence among mates. To mollify matters militant messers may now muss up their mohawks with markedly more cosmetics. Meanwhile, the main menu has been met with a makeover.</p>
<p>The macabre mirror matches of Straftat are unmissable. In a moment when many media misfits like myself are miscontent with modern multiplayer movement shooters, the immeasurably multiplying maps of the Lemaitres make for a minorly mythical tale of unmatchable might. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">marvellous</a> map for the medium to meet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've been meaning to research the Crusades for a while. A series of vicious medieval religious wars for control of the Holy Land, initiated by the Latin Christian Church following the conquest of Jerusalem by the Rashidun Caliphate, they've become a collection of memes bandied around by today's armchair fascists. See also, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">"deus vult"</a>. I've explored them indirectly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">articles about the cultural inheritance of Warhammer 40,000</a>, but never really dipped into any history books or crusader fiction save for ailing 2004 action game Knights Of The Temple: Infernal Crusade, in which Sir Spamalot Go Bonk against a majestic sunset.</p>
<p>One place to start the R&amp;D rollout might be Knights Of The Crusades, a grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> 4X game in which players re-enact the period from the perspective of Christian and Muslim factions.</p><!--more-->

<p>Knights Of The Crusades launched into early access this week, and "takes you on a grand journey through the First Crusade and beyond--across the Holy Land, Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Europe." It's from the developers of the Kingdom Wars games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-the-machine-starts">which we have enjoyed in the past</a>, and strikes me as basically Age Of Empires but Paradox-scale.</p>
<p>The main campaign sees you first tooling up to contest Jerusalem and then, growing your holdings as you "shape a world that reacts to your choices across a massive dynamic map filled with cities, pilgrim routes, shifting alliances, and relentless holy wars". There is much talk in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440120/_Knights_of_the_Crusades/">the Steam page overview video</a> of raiding hamlets and putting innocents to the sword. Glamorising it may be, but it doesn't seem sanitised. There's the endgame prospect of, essentially, becoming the bad guys from Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>The above describes the initial Eastern European Christian or Templar campaigns, anyway: as regards the early access update schedule, the developers are promising "a lot of focus on making every culture feel unique, with new units, building sets, and mechanics for Pagan, Orthodox, Muslim, and Western Christian factions."</p>
<p>Will it turn out to be a careful study of two hundred years of zealotry and pillage, or will it be another excuse for the scurvy alt-righteous to cosplay as Richard the Lionheart, or will it be some secret third thing? Only you, a hypothetical Crusades historian and/or time-traveller who has played the 1.0 version, can decide. Right now, I'll settle for saying that I'm abstractly interested in the idea of a campaign that begins with a Zerg rush towards a specific location, then phases into a more open-ended and murky 4X structure.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start any video game-skewed Crusades research would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, but I fear I am too daft and fickle to play Crusader Kings. Or too time-strapped, anyway. Still, I welcome any advice you have about either the Paradox series or other video games that investigate this terrible period and its legacy. It can't be <em>all</em> strategy sims, surely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> will get a non-VR release on PC later this year, allowing would-be Colonial Marines access to its Weyland-Yutani black site without first requiring you to force your head inside a pair of microscopic televisions. Subtitled "Evolved Edition" - which feels like a real elbow in the kidneys for VR evangelists - it will sport "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals". Hopefully, that'll be enough to juice the VR version's current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850050/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_VR/">Mixed</a> user review consensus on Steam. </p><!--more-->

<p>As you may guess from the above, I'm not a VR evangelist, partly because I can't afford a modern VR headset and don't have the living space to play VR games without injuring myself, my loved ones or my precious (scavenged) bedroom furniture. I only own an original PSVR, which is curled up in the corner of my cupboard like a dead servo-skull. It was last used to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-squadrons">Star Wars: Squadrons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-beast">Paper Beast</a>, which are the two VR games I consider worth the discomfort, if not the expense, of VR.</p>
<p>I hear that the latest Zucker Buckets and Gaben Goggles are more comfortable to wear, but I still don't trust myself to put them on without becoming a public health hazard. I have terrible, humiliating memories of previewing some Marvel VR game at an event. Surrounded by the minions of Thanos, I swung Thor's hammer with all of my strength and clanged the PR person over the head. This happened in a converted warehouse about 300 metres wide. Now, imagine if I'd been surrounded by digital xenomorphs. That PR person would be dead.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm delighted that Rogue Incursion has decided to trade in its fancy eyestrain helmet for reassuringly non-engulfing 2D displays. Here's some story blurb about Rogue Incursion. It's the first of a two-act story, with the second act promising "new challenges and deadlier enemies".</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new action-horror entry into the classic franchise, Alien: Rogue Incursion transforms you into Zula Hendricks-the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments-on an extremely dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan. With her synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled stealth and serious firepower at her disposal. And when the threat she discovers has extinction-level consequences, Zula suddenly finds herself with humanity's fate on her shoulders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Evolved Edition launches on 30th September. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a>. Did you play the VR one? Let us know how you got on with it. While we're talking Alien, I'll conclude by shoving you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">the next game from the people behind Duskers</a>, one of the finest unofficial Alien games yet made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
