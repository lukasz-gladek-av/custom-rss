            <p>I did not expect to meet Mozart in Shovel Game, nor did I expect him to ask me to mine a pyramid of shit, with the helpful advice that I start at the top to avoid any floating shitbricks. Mozart is probably the least interesting thing about Shovel Game, actually.</p>
<p>It's a shortform first-person oddity with Minecraft-style destructible voxels (yes I know Minecraft doesn't really use voxels) and a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/action-half-life-the-5-a-m">AHL_5am</a>. The idea is to tunnel through "a sequence of strange and unfamiliar spaces". Here's a trailer.

<p>Only certain blocks can be mined, and you'll want to dig with caution, because the catacombs are full of groaning, wailing sprites that look like Zordon from Power Rangers. It's as if somebody had cracked the glass on his energy tube, freeing the galactic wizard's blobby visage to wander the Earth in pain. Enemies kill you on contact and I've yet to discover any weapons, just my trusty shovel and an 8-ball - purpose unknown.
</p><p>It's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3869670/Shovel_Game/">Steam</a>, but you can find <a href="https://lukewasthefish.itch.io/shovel-game">a demo on Itch.io</a>. Expect plenty of aggravation: there's a labyrinth full of oozy blue phantoms that requires fast footwork. Also a kind of cosmic chapel full of what appear to be flattened babies. The developer is Luke Vincent, who created it for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-002/entries">"shovelware horror" gamejam</a>, ho ho.</p>
<p>Bonus game mention: leafing through the submissions page for that jam, I discover a new work from Mike Klubnika, architect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/split-mike-klubnika">S.p.l.i.t.</a>, which Nic had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/split-review">eloquent emotions about</a>. Co-developed with James Dornan, Klubnika's jam game is called <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/crank-it">Crank It</a> and is about being stuck behind a set of gadgets in a cavernous hallway, trying to spot horrible creatures. Got to say, this sounds far worse than shit pyramid Mozart.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> began life as a DLC expansion, but then developers Team Cherry decided the concept was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-developers-announce-a-full-sequel-silksong">"too large and too unique</a>", and upgraded it into a full game. They spent six years working on the thing in almost total silence, while fulminating legions of the terminally online quietly drove themselves bonkers hunting for release date clues. We now have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-youve-only-got-to-wait-a-little-bit-skonger">Silksong release date</a> - it's just two weeks away - so in theory, the nightmare is over. Except, oh dear - Team Cherry are planning post-launch content for Silksong, and they're already calling it "ambitious". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">breakout interview</a> with Press X To Jason Schreier, the person who considerately does all the investigative reporting in games journalism so that humbler souls like myself can spend our days taking the piss out of him. According to Schreier, "they're already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come." Then there are some snippets from Team Cherry's founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," Pellen said. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."
</p>
<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," interjected Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p><p>
Those monsters! I look forward to revisiting this post in 2030, assuming RPS hasn't been turned into sausages by then, while writing up the latest rumours about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>: Polyestertune or Satinmelody or whatever they end up calling the third one. In fairness, Hollow Knight did get actual DLC expansions before Silksong that launched at a regular rate.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the DLC tease is perhaps better interpreted as show of kindness. Earlier in the interview, Gibson and Pellen fret that by actually releasing Silksong, they're spoiling things for players for whom the real Silksong is speculating endlessly about the release of Silksong.</p>
<p>"It's nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they've obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it," said Gibson, diplomatically. Added Pellen: "Feels like we're going to ruin their fun by releasing the game." I guess their tantalising talk of "ambitious" post-launch material is a bid to keep the dream alive, then.
