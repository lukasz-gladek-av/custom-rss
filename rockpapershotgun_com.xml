            <p>Yesterday, modding site Nexus Mods announced a change in ownership that'll see its founder step back. Not much info was provided in the announcement as to who the new owners were, but it's now been confirmed to be a company called Chosen.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-announce-ownership-change-but-the-folks-taking-over-remain-a-bit-mysterious">reported</a>, the ownership change announcement penned by Nexus mods founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott didn't go into much detail as to the identity of those being handed the reigns. A Victor and a Marinus were cited as having "come on board to lead this next chapter", along with links to their Nexus Mods profiles that only offered brief bios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We reached out to Nexus Mods yesterday in order to try and learn more about the identity of the new owners, and were provided with a statement by community lead Mathew Elliott.</p>
<p>"We didn’t go into too much detail about the new ownership in the initial post, but the community has been quick to put on their investigator hats, digging into the new owners’ identities, backgrounds, beliefs, even their favorite football teams, and speculating on what this might mean for modding," it said, "A bit of Reddit or Twitter sleuthing will surface most of what they've found." It added that the new owners are "very hands-on and are now embedded directly with the team in our offices."</p>
<p>The community sleuthing Elliott referenced was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-site-has-been-sold.1219452/page-2">this ResetEra thread</a>, which saw users RandomlyRandom67 and chocobalt conclude that the new owners are a company called Chosen, with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-folmann/">Victor Folmann</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinus-elgaard/">Marinus Elgaard</a> believed to be the Victor and Marinus referred to in Scott's post. This has now been confirmed via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a stickied comment</a> on Scott's original post.</p>
<p>In it, Folmann, Elgaard, and Nikolaj Nyholm address Scott's post not mentioning Chosen by name, writing: "This post wasn’t about Chosen — it was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active."</p>
<p>The trio assert that they don't plan to start charging for mods or revoking lifetime premium  subscriptions, adding in terms of monetisation in general: "We’re not changing the core model. No aggressive monetisation. No paid mods. If anything, we’re aiming for fewer ads, not more."</p>
<p>Chosen, which was only founded in January 2025, <a href="https://www.wearechosen.io/">state their aim</a> as being to "partner with founders to help scale what they’ve built—amplifying their impact, supporting their team and culture, and ensuring the business thrives for the long term." Basically, they look to be in the business of buying into or buying up community-focused platforms (their website cites previous work with the likes of EA FC community databases <a href="https://www.futbin.com/">FUTBIN</a> and <a href="https://renderz.app/">RenderZ</a>), and running them, with founders offered the chance to stay on board or take a "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313157405918294018/">quick, straightforward exit</a>" that Chosen claim shouldn't leave them worrying about their creation going down the pan.</p>
<p>Folmann's LinkedIn activity came under scrutiny following the aforementioned ResetEra sleuthing, including a 'Gaming startup monetisation cheat sheet' that mentions NFTs and crypto, originally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_gaming-startup-monetization-cheat-sheet-activity-7254843104778743824-072i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40">posted seven months ago</a>. When a commenter fretted about these features being added to Nexus Mods, Folmann <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7254843103344287744?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340502971027271681%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%2C7340506104696623104%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340502971027271681%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287340506104696623104%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7254843103344287744%29">responded</a> "100% agree — not happening".</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/victor-folmann_fundraising-startups-founders-activity-7286004822758035456-HSyz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAB_mKVYB3dueA0zR9oGk-0S67NVqlS0qC40"> post</a> from four months ago sees him predict that in 2025 "AI will enable solo devs to create $100M hits and 2-person teams to build AAA games", and claim "AI-powered modding will revolutionise game development".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods and Chosen for comment.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how all of this plays out, but originally announcing the ownership change in a way that left folks needing to do some pretty in-depth detective work to find out exactly who was taking over seems a strange and counterproductive move on Nexus Mods' part, at least from a PR perspective.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Beta test site and small game curator Alpha Beta Gamer have put out their Games To Get Excited About 2025 showcase, and (salt to taste, granted) it's exactly what it says on the tin. 110 curated trailers in an hour and five minutes, organised and timestamped by genre, with no paid adverts and no teeth-grindingly awful skits. They've also made a point to not include any cinematic trailers, although I haven't watched the whole thing yet. They might be liars. Are you liars, Alpha Beta Gamer? Wait, don't answer that. I've seen Labyrinth like fifty billion times, I know how this ends up.</p>

<p>Being a jiving hepcat iconoclast trailblazer, I immediately scrubbed through to the 'weird games' category, which reminded me how obscenely gorgeous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-living-things-is-a-stop-motion-artbook-puzzle-game-based-on-a-600-year-old-alchemical-manuscript">All Living Things </a>is, and also introduced me to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, in which you punch people for refusing to pay the fare on your trolleybus. The FPS section opened with <a href="https://rowye.itch.io/darkenstein-3-d">Darkenstein 3D</a>, which looks a bit like classic Medal Of Honor but with nazi-hunting and dog rescuing. And I also learned that speculative biology tale <a href="https://nomarsh.itch.io/scrimshaw">South Scrimshaw</a> is getting a second part. This was all through some very casual browsing, mind. I feel I should also point out that at no point was I assaulted by a.) a muppet, b.) a pair of shit shoes, or c.) Hideo Kojima.</p>
<p>"It’s a streamlined experience created to counteract the bloat of the mainstream Summer showcases," says ABG. And yeah, can't fault them on that at all. Do let me know if you spot anything especially groovy, or perhaps even the coveted double-groovy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Casino roguelike" AAA Simulator's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/">Steam page has a demo</a>, and also a boxout description I imagine I'd find extremely trite (in a Brewdog Punk IPA, Outer Worlds anti-capitalism-as-a-feature type way) if I hadn't already read designer Nic Vasudeva-Barkdull's much more convincing and considered thoughts on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicbarkdull_aaa-simulator-on-steam-activity-7336656661970874368-Nn3F">putting the game together</a>. This is the nature of trying to sell a game in a couple of sentences, admittedly.</p>

<p>Vasudeva-Barkdull says the idea came about when Blizzard's Rod Fergusson implored executives, in the wake of layoffs, to "be empathetic...these people aren't knobs and dials". It made Vasudeva-Barkdull wonder, he says, "what kinds of knobs and dials the executives of these companies actually have, and whether there could be game design that actually shapes your actions towards greed and callousness".</p>
<p>"My first instinct was that if a player were given a literal knob or slider to hire and fire people, along with an ever-increasing profit goal to meet, they would have no choice but to do evil things like mass layoffs in service of the bottom line," says Vasudeva-Barkdull.  "The design of the system wouldn't have it any other way. And that, I believe, is the core truth of simulating the corporate world. Any option which does not bring profit to the shareholders simply does not exist - in the simulation or in reality".</p>
<p>Incentivising player callousness by marrying it to efficiency or other incentives isn't a new idea, of course. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a> etc. But I do think there's something interesting in stripping away the narra-framing and telling a story <em>about</em> a system, albeit with some heightened surreality and a bit of silliness.</p>
<p>As for the demo itself? It made me grin like a guilty pickpocket roleplaying as a guilt-agnostic pickpocket, yeah. You fire people ten at a time. Hiring interns is abstracted as a buff where you "select five employees to receive minus 100% salary", itself very funny and horrible wording, but it feels especially nasty when you go to use it and actually have to click five employees with names and jobs shuffling their way around the studio. The interface and music are pretty charming, too. It all feels very cartridge-coded - much lighter and livelier than you'd probably expect from a business tycoon or management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. The full thing is out September if you fancy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
