            <p>
This afternoon, a choice of two raging videogame lawsuits to report on. Firstly, a snippet from the on-going courtroom scrap between former Unknown Worlds executives and Krafton over the state of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s development, in which the former accuse the latter of changing their story about why the executives were fired.</p>
<p>I've decided not to write that one up because it feels like we are entering the realm of potshots over minutiae, rather than learning anything genuinely new about Subnautica 2 or its creators, but if you're interested, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-inc-versus-subnautica-2-former-lead-developers">GamesIndustry.biz has your back</a>. The parallel Tencent/Sony bust-up has the virtue of relative novelty. It gives me a whole <em>different</em> kind of headache. What's going on with this one, then?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Well, last November Tencent announced that they would publish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light Of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic adventure featuring robot mammoths, archery, red-haired ladies, and scrapmetal tribal aesthetics. An ungenerous commenter might assert that it's a "slavish clone" of Sony's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. That's what Sony called it, anyway, when they announced in July this year that they were going to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">sue Tencent back to the Neo-Stone Age for copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
In their California federal court filing, Sony alleged that Tencent had, in fact, approached them in 2024 and pitched a new Horizon game under license, even as development continued on Light of Motiram. As James noted in our write-up, the implication here is that Tencent were going to make their very own Horizon game regardless of whether Sony consented to brand it an official sequel or spin-off. 
</p><p>
Sony sought to block Light Of Motiram's release, arguing that it would cause "irreparable harm to SIE and the consuming public", which is rather histrionic. I am picturing a solitary tear rolling down the face of a member of the Consuming Public as they plead with the storekeeper that they wanted the <em>other</em> 6/10 metal dinosaur game, not this one. Yes, it is I - the Horizon disliker. Still, I can't deny that the games look rather similar, and it's telling that Tencent have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">edited Light Of Motiram's Steam page</a> to remove some of the more obvious points of overlap with Horizon.
</p>
<p>
Tencent have now hit back against Sony's accusations with even louder language. They contend that Sony are seeking "an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", and that Light Of Motiram ain't even finished yet and as such, can't be fairly assessed for what it invents or borrows. They also say that Sony are suing the wrong people. 
</p>
<p>
As passed on by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">The Game Post</a>, Tencent's motion to dismiss the case comments that "at bottom, Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain." 
</p>
<p>
Tencent further argue that Sony's claims for Horizon Zero Dawn's originality have been "flatly contradicted" by developers Guerrilla, citing a behind-the-scenes doc in which art director Jan-Bart Van Beek compared the game to Ninja Theory's 2013 action-adventure Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. They also make reference to "the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolise through this lawsuit". 
</p><p>
They insist that Light Of Motiram "merely employs the same time-honoured tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon - like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>: Primal, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-new-dawn">Far Cry: New Dawn</a>, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more". In summary, they accuse Sony of trying to "transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets."
</p>
<p>
As regards Sony's argument that Tencent wanted to make a Horizon game for them, and decided to proceed with their "slavish clone" despite not being given permission, Tencent's court motion refers to a GDC meeting from March 2024 in which Tencent reps pitched a licensed Horizon mobile game. They claim that since no actual Tencent executives or employees were at the meeting, nothing at the meeting "is alleged to be an act of copyright or trademark infringement".
</p>
<p>
As for the 'suing the wrong people stuff', Tencent's motion notes that Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, whereas Light Of Motiram is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, who operate under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as 'Tencent Games' and/or 'Level Infinite'". Tencent's lawyers are of the opinion that "Sony's threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue."
</p>
<p>
I'm no lawyer, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">belated efforts to educate myself</a>, but the last two paragraphs read to me like Tencent are trying to get off on a technicality. I sympathise more with the line about Horizon not being as original as all that, and certain ideas being public property. Except that I'm pretty sure that if the roles were reversed and Light of Motiram had launched before Horizon: Zero Dawn, Tencent would have been yelling blue murder about breach of copyright.</p><p>The discussion of what Light Of Motiram - out 2027 - yoinks or doesn't yoink from Horizon is kind of fun to follow, because it's comparing ideas and aesthetics. In general, though, I default to the position that picking sides in a copyright spat between two billion dollar videogame publishers is like deciding which cybernetic T-Rex you most want to step on you.

            <p>Something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>-related has happened <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">at an Australian museum again</a>. This time, rather than the game being confirmed for an appearance back when it was still infinitely mysterious and sans release date, it's Team Cherry devs addressing just how difficult their creation is, following plenty of post-release discourse on the subject.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">first patch making a couple of its early bosses a bit easier</a> to tackle, amid debate as to whether it's just good and hard, or pushes into unnecessarily annoying slog territory via the likes of bench placement and hazards being able to deal out two masks of damage. As with every FromSoft game since time itself began with the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a>, where you stand on that bickering will likely depend on how prepared you are to spend hours battling one foe over and over again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Naturally, the appropriate venue for Team Cherry co-directors Ari Gibson and William Pellen to weigh in on this conundrum of our time is Australia’s national museum of screen culture, <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">ACMI</a>, where the launch of a new exhibition was attended and reported on by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>.</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson said when asked about the difficulty by exhibition co-curator Jini Maxwell. "So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes."</p><p>While acknowledging that Skong packs "some moments of steep difficulty", Gibson stuck to emphasising that going for a wander is the best medicine if you get stuck banging your head against a bug-shaped wall, as there are "ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely". Learning? In a video game? Come on lads, I can't be doing that. I use my brain for marginally more important things during the average day, but by the time I get to playing games for non-work purposes, it's all just mush up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. Gibson and Pellen also explained the differences between developing Silksong and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> from a hardness perspective. Hornet, with her superior zippiness and superior skills to the knight, demanded more complicated base enemies to make sure she still faced a good challenge.</p>
<p>"The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," Pellen said. "The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away."</p>
<p>I imagine this was followed up with a gesture to some screens of culture as the devs indicated that the time had come to check out the Aussie exhibitions. If you're still struggling with Silksong, definitely check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked very hard on. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">also</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in">mods</a>.</p>

            <p>Parkoury zombie bludgeoner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has, literally just this minute, gone on sale, which means the review embargo curtain has lifted on RPS to reveal... an empty chair with an IOU stuck to it.</p>
<p>This one is my bad, rather than because of any cheeky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">code</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">withholding</a>. I’d simply underestimated how many trillions of PC games were also out this week, and had to abandon my charge through The Beast to help keep the undermanned Treehouse on top of things elsewhere. Still, we’ll shortly be bringing you a full, likely much better appraisal from RPS veteran Dominic Tarason (thaaaaaanks Dominic), and in penance, I offer some initial impressions from my couple of hours with the game’s opening.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">Techland weren’t kidding about the nighttime</a>. In response to complaints that the nocturnally inclined zombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a> weren’t sufficiently scary after the sun goes down, The Beast looks to put more horror back in the darkness. Successfully, in the mind of this wimp. Between the night’s pitch blackness, the keyring LED you call a torch, and the sprinting, lethally hench super-zeds that aren’t at all keen on sharing the game’s rooftops, any sort of freerunning you were flexing with during the daylight hours is effectively reduced to nervous shimmying through the void.</p>
<p>Yet it still feels like you’re <em>supposed</em> to be chased back to the safehouse by these burly Volatile bois now and then, in which case panic and near-blindness become enemies in themselves. Several attempts to survive my first night ended with my shinbones shooting up into my lungs, the stress of a pursuit having overwhelmed my ability to consider whether a roof-to-roof jump was actually doable before I hurled myself into the cobbles below. It’s not always "fun", strictly speaking. But it is decent horror.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Techland</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If anything, The Beast’s brighter hours could do with more of this urgency. The bread-and-butter meleeing benefits from some nicely heavy hittin' sticks, but the actual swinging sensation is on the wrong side of sluggish, at least in these early stages. The first two bosses aren't that exhilarating either: they require little in the way of sharp timing or last-gasp dodging, outside of a few repeating, heavily telegraphed attacks.</p><p>Visually and practically, they’re also just minor variations on the same 'What if a ghoul was taller and shredded' concept, which somewhat saps the excitement out of your stated mission of hunting and killing as many of these souped- up zeds as possible. Fleeting thrills can be had in the moments when you transform into a berzerking monsterman yourself, ripping off limbs and punching through chest cavities, but the time limit on this literal beast mode seems disappointingly stingy, considering how many regular shovel hits it takes to build up the gauge.</p>
<p>Again, mind, I’d only got two hours into what is supposedly a 20-hour-plus campaign. And I was similarly insta-fatigued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">apparently ain’t half bad</a> once it gets rolling. Maybe I really <em>should</em> stick to hardware, in which case, I’ll note that Dying Light: The Beast has also been granted Verified status for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – justifiably so, as it repeatedly breached 60fps on my Steam Deck OLED when running in Performance mode. There is the slight hitch of an Epic Game Store pop-up asking on launch if you want to sync accounts, but it doesn’t throw up any serious non-Steam-app compatibility woes, and can be banished with a tap of the B button on subsequent boots.</p>
