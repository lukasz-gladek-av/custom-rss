Reader, I am about to venture into that terrible ninth circle of videogame journalist cringe known as pitching your own game in an article. A while ago, I <a href="https://x.com/dirigiblebill/status/1501695516035403780">mused aloud on Xitter</a> that a Batman game (or offbrand spiritual homage) from the perspective of people trying to commit petty crimes in Gotham City would be Interesting and/or Countercultural.</p>
<p>You could portray Batman himself as both a lone vigilante and a pervasive environmental factor - a morbid, hallucinatory tendency of the architecture itself, gradually provoked and intensified by tiny acts of larceny and vandalism. Kind of like the Eye of Sauron, but it’s the Bat Signal, and instead of fighting the urge to wear the Ring, you’re stealing candy bars and writing on toilet walls.

<p>
The above “Batman but it’s the pedestrian POV” video from Gaming with Griff Griffin – disclosure, he’s an old colleague of mine from my time at Future Publishing in the early 2010s – isn’t really what I’m talking about. It shows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> from the perspective of random civilians, spectating on fights (with the usual slowmo) or watching the Caped Misbehaver glide and zipline through the cloudy night.</p><p>Still, it’s close enough to my Twitter concept that I’m going to sue the pants off Griffin. Or burst through his window in a latex suit and delete all his browser tabs… then open and close the browser again so that he can’t restore his previous webpages. With any luck, he’ll become the Joker and we can have a proper vendetta. It’s at least two years since I last had one of those.
</p>
<p>
The accompanying voiceover and editing elicit the quickfix reaction energy of TikTok and similar shortform video platforms. It works well enough, not least because Arkham Knight’s city is so sheeny, dirty and convincing. But it leaves me hankering for a longer video or write-up with fewer changes of POV - perhaps *ominous roll of thunder* a diary series like the ones we used to read on RPS before half the writing team got Thanos-snapped or rode off triumphantly into the sunset. I’m thinking of coverage akin to role-playing a peasant in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, treating it like a medieval life sim. But perhaps what I’m really thinking of, again, is a standalone game.
</p>
<p>
How would it feel, to be remotely anti-social and rebellious in a city prowled by Batman? You could lean into the Adam West absurdity of Bruce chasing after kids for sticking chewing gum to park seats. Or you could give your character more of a backstory, and embrace pathos. Maybe you’re breaking into a pharmacy to get medicine for your mum. 
</p>
<p>
You could also use the format to play with the idea that Batman is, you know, kind of a big dirty fascist and one-man militia, deploying his billions to terrorise poor people who are always characterised as loudly dressed freaks or irredeemable hooligans in vests. You could investigate the idea that Batman is absolutely off his rocker, and that his derangement pervades the very stones and skies of Gotham City, sharpening the spires and filling the sewers with bats. You could play with the thought that we are all trapped in Batman’s terrible dreams.

            <p>Ubisoft have proposed a round of voluntary redundancies at their Paris headquarters, which could see as many as 200 jobs cut. These plans follow a major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations and restructuring</a> by the publishers last week, which came with a mandate demanding staff return to working in-office five days a week (an annual allowance of work-from-home days was part of that proposal). All of that understandably drew the ire of unions representing Ubisoft workers, with a number now having reportedly agreed to a three day-long strike next month. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">IGN</a> of the proposed Paris layoffs. If those cuts do see 200 jobs eliminated, that would affect around 18% of workers at Ubisoft HQ, whom IGN cite as currently numbering approximately 1100 in total.</p>
<p>"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the Ubisoft spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."</p>
<p>The union response to these layoff plans appears to have been swift, with French financial paper <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a> reporting this morning that all of the French unions representing Ubisoft workers have agreed to a three day-long strike set to run from February 10th to 12th. The five French unions - the Video Game Workers' Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, the CFE-CGC, the CGT, and Printemps écologique - are also reported to be reaching out to unions outside of France who represent Ubisoft workers in an effort to make sure the pushback isn't limited to a single country.</p><p>The Solidaires Informatique union previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">called for a half-day strike on January 22nd</a> as "an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions". "It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions,” they wrote at the time, in comments addressed to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. "Perhaps he needs to be reminded that it is his employees who make the games."</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.service-public.gouv.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F37509">Rupture Conventionnelle Collective</a> process requires any staff departures as part of it to be voluntary and subject to terms agreed upon by employees and unions, the question is what might happen if Ubisoft don't end up viewing it as having seen enough workers agree to give up their jobs. The answer in that case could well be regular old layoffs, as Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">recently inflicted</a> on The Division devs Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm after a voluntary redundancy scheme at the former reportedly didn't get rid of enough staff to satisfy Ubisoft management.</p>
