            <p>I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Workshop will let players download and share maps, campaigns, new weapons and gadgets that they've added to the game, although ambitious modders will need to know the Lua scripting language to implement their changes. It looks like the map editor is pretty friendly, however, given the 2D tile-based levels.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of topdown games that aim to walk in Hotline Miami's bloody footprints, but Intravenous 2 differs by going deep on tactical elements. You can stealth through the levels if you choose: enemies of vision cones, you can hide in shadows, and you can manipulate the environment by turning off lights, lockpicking doors, or using items to distract or lure enemies.
</p>
<p>You can also tinker with your skills and weaponry. There are 29 weapons according to the Steam page - although whether that's been updated to reflect those added in updates such as this one, I don't know - and those weapons can be customised with suppressors, laser sights, ammo types and so on.
</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Intravenous 2 brags that its storyline is dynamic and changes based on your style of play. I don't know how far it follows through with that, but I'm interested in giving it a go just because I love stealth games and tactical combat. I've had good experiences with topdown games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/door-kickers">Door Kickers</a>, and I'd be onboard with a less fiddly, more action-oriented take on a similar experience. Topdown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, as opposed to topdown SWAT? I dare to dream.
</p>
<p>One day, one day I will find time to play it. For now: hey, it's cool that its got mod support. All games should have mod support. You can find more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608270/Intravenous_2/">on Steam</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sons-of-the-forest">Sons Of The Forest</a> is about being chased by fithy cannibals who cannot swim, so the latest update ought to be useful to players. Its major new feature is the addition of rafts, which players can construct and then float about on like a 2000s Tom Hanks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rafts come in three flavours ranging from small, slightly less small, to a full on houseboat with walls and ceilings. All three can be tied to the shore with a new mooring structure, and otherwise paddled about the lakes and waterways of the island.
</p>
<p>There are some other neat new features, too. Players can now draw plans for defensive walls around their base and leave Kelvin to do the hardwork of constructing them. Kelvin also now has a faster swim animation and both he and Virginia are able to pull themselves out of water at its edge, both of which seem useful when they inevitably fall off your raft.
</p>
<p>If you make the mistake of ever coming back to land, there are apparently impprovements to aiming with the crossbow, compound bow, crafted bow, shotgun and slingshot, all of which you'll see while scrabbling to survive against the cannibals.
</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280">patch notes are available over on Steam</a>. We already liked the game plenty when it hit 1.0 early last year, as Matt Cox (RPS in peace) explained in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sons-of-the-forest-review">Sons Of The Forest review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s developers have agreed to pay a $20 million (around Â£16.4m) fine to settle charges brought by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC allege that HoYoverse "unfairly marketed loot boxes to children that obscured real costs and misled all players about the odds of obtaining prizes." HoYoverse will also be banned from selling lootboxes to children under 16 without parental consent.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cognosphere_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> (PDF) alleges that Genshin Impact's warren of different currencies is "challenging and confusing, particularly for children and teens.
</p>
<p>"Players must exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes, with exchange rates in unusual denominations. This complicated system, according to the complaint, misleads consumers about the amount of money that players spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money that players would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes."
</p>
<p>The same complaint also alleges that HoYoverse collected personal information about children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). 
</p>
<p>The allegation that Genshin Impact misleads children about the odds of winning "Five-Star Prizes" in part relates to the Event Banners and "influencer campaigns", which the FTC says "give players the impression that they will have better odds of obtaining the five-star prize being promoted than they have in reality."
</p>
<p>The ruling which would see HoYoverse pay the fine, delete the data held about children aged under 13, and no longer sell lootbnoxes to children under 16, requires approval by a federal judge before it can go into effect.
</p>
<p>"Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning," said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTCâs Bureau of Consumer Protection in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">press release</a>. "Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions."
