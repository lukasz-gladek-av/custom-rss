            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed Palfarm, a new farming spin-off whose cheeky compound title implies the possibility of countless other Palspin-offs, from Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/train-simulator">train Simulator</a> to Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">netenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be a Palworld version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, with players alternating between tending crops, mining the caves, battling wildlife, and bonding with the local NPCs. As in vanilla Palworld, you can capture Pals with different abilities and set them to work on tasks like sowing and watering. Here's a trailer.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-farming-spin-off-revealed-just-11-days-after-nintendo-announced-pokemon-equivalent-pokopia">Eurogamer</a> note, all this follows swiftly after the reveal of Nintendo's new Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, which also involves farming. Nintendo are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">suing Pocket Pair for alleged patent infringement regarding the Pokémon series</a>, which makes the announcement of Palfarm a bit like playfully tweaking the genitals of an enraged Pyroar while it's trying to bite your head off.
</p><p>
You can read more about Palfarm on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It appears to be retaining Palworld's viral blend of whimsy and parodic cruelty. "On this island with its changing seasons, a relaxing farm life with Pals awaits!" chirrups the description. "Of course, eating your own Pals is absolutely out of the question!" 
</p>
<p>
Later, there is mention of killing off Pals in the wilderness, because "after all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way" and "sometimes what you reap might be red". Congratulations, Pocketpair, you have triangulated the secret callousness of the videogame concept of "farming".
</p>
<p>
There's multiplayer, and a town with a commercial area and a hidden black market. The black market appears to be run by a pipe-smoking blaggard with a very large revolver. You can play Russian roulette with him, seemingly. You can also push snowballs to make them bigger, and get married. No release date yet.

Kojima Productions have shared a new trailer for OD, their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>. Unlike last night's melancholy breadcrumb of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> coverage, this reveal actually has substance. It looks a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a>, Hideo Kojima's much-mourned teaser for his cancelled Silent Hills project, inasmuch as the game appears to be first-person, and the trailer is set in some kind of menacing residential building. The whole video is pervaded by the fear of something trying to get in, as expressed by the title "Knock". You can watch it below, unless you're too <em>scared</em>.

Are you too scared? I'm sorry to make light of your perfectly reasonable desire to avoid sources of tension and alarm. Here, allow me to transcribe. We see through the eyes of a young woman played by Sophia Lillis, as she enters a windowed room with rain and trees beyond. There are some institutional-looking chairs - perhaps this is another horror game sanitarium? - and a small makeshift altar by one window, with a bunch of mismatched candles and an eerie post-it of a staring eye. Some of the candles look like distressed babies. The babies recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, though none of them are in jars. Lillis begins lighting candles using a matchbox emblazoned with the word "MISSING" and a drawing of an airplane.
</p>
<p>
The play environment also puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>. Sorry, I skipped over a bit in my description above: let me flashback about 60 seconds. There's an opening scene of a big red ornamental door with smaller arched portals carved into it, and a miniature sealed double doorway at the top with gold foil flourishes. Unlike the door in Silent Hill 4, this door isn't chained shut.
</p><p>
Somebody slides a red greeting card through the jamb with a nightmare drawing of a face on one side, consisting mostly of eyes. On the other side there is an instruction to "light fires" and "celebrate" something blurred out. Also, some vaguely alchemical imagery. Other, partly redacted trailer text refers to rituals, curses, a 3D scan of a building, and direful events ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
Skip forward again to Lillis lighting candles. There's a knock at the door behind her. She carries on lighting candles. The knocking intensifies. Lillis lights a candle that resembles a baby's screaming head, and it goes all crimson and icky. The unseen door opens. Lillis is seriously not keen on whatever is coming through the door, which she refuses to look at. The trespasser sounds damp and slithery. The eye on the post-it opens wide. Then, we switch to a head-on view of Lillis gurning tearfully. The Thing looming behind her grabs her head, and we fade to black. How very OD.
</p>
<p>
I do enjoy these parts of the KojiGame reveal cycle, when the marketing deals however showily in symbol and metaphor. The elusiveness was part of P.T.'s charm, and inevitably, I begin to worry about how the developers might spoil things by unredacting the backstory and reducing the eyes, the baby candles, and the door made of doors to pieces of characterisation and world-building.</p>
<p>Despite having literally just written a piece <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-comes-the-feeling-promises-kojima-in-latest-maddening-tease-for-metal-gear-like-physint">whining that Kojima Productions haven't told us much about Physint</a>, I am now going to hope that they don't share too much about OD. I know, I am a creature of both presumption and contradiction. That's <em>me</em> knocking at the door, except I can't work out whether I really want to come in.
</p>
<p>
The trailer is from Kojima Productions' big livestream last night. Elsewhere in the show, Kojima assured that OD is "not a game about lighting candles". Please, Kojima, no guns.
