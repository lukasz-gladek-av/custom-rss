            <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update aiming to smooth out more of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">performance problems</a> which have plagued the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since launch, especially on PC. Unfortuntely, this latest patch looks to have led to an uptick in stuttering for some players, with Gearbox recommending some shader messing around as a potential fix.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the studio, you can't say they haven't been working hard to get Borderlands 4 running a bit more smoothly since problems in that department became apparent, with this being the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-a-new-pc-patch-to-fix-crashes-progression-blockers-and-gpu-related-problems">post-launch patch targeting performance</a> in the past couple of weeks. One of them was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">confusingly noteless</a>, but hey.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, this one <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">has notes</a>, and delving into them you'll find a few tweaks to weekly activities being granted top billing before things descend into fix territory. The weekly big encore boss has been swapped to a tougher version of another existing boss and will offer more loot. The weekly wildcard mission's changed and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has been moved.
</p>
<p>In terms of fixes, Gearbox cited the rectifying of "various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes" as well as "infinite loading screens during crossplay". Characters should also load up faster in menus, and their animations have been updated to match the fixes. Sadly, it seems that the update's actually led some players to experience more performance problems, with Gearbox acknowledging this in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>"Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing," they wrote. "If you're still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer's approved method." If problems persist, you'll have to <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/categories/39763360813843">file a support ticket</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>That aside, studio have also made some changes to rewards and progression with this update, plus some minor tweaks to individual vault hunters. On top of that, there's a bit of gear balancing, with the tweaks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellwalker: now always spawns with Fire element</li>
<li>Tediore weapons: +10% Damage and +10% magazine size</li>
<li>Order Pistol Lucky Clover (Rocket Reload): increased fire rate</li>
<li>Order Sniper Rifle Fisheye: increased Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins has <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643">revealed in a tweet</a> that the game's next patch'll be much heavier on the balancing tweaks. "As a note, we had too many Vault Hunter buffs to safely fit into today's big update," he wrote. "Instead, we broke up them into their own balance update that we're targeting to release early next week instead."</p><p>Here's hoping that Gearbox can get their shooty thing running nicely soon, especially since yapping CEO Randy Pitchford thankfully looks to have stopped giving impromptu setup advice on the socials. As for the game itself, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Jasmine Mannan gave it a go for us</a> and generally liked what these four bordered lands had to offer.</p>

            <p>After much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">hemming and hawing</a>, Asus and Microsoft are finally ready to talk pricing on their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PC</a> team-ups, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. It’s nothing too egregious in the King’s sterling, with the Xbox ROG Ally confirmed at £499.99 and the Xbox ROG Ally X at £799.99 – while hardly chump change, these are pretty standard prices for entry-level and premium portables respectively.</p>
<p>Those in the US, however, will be paying $599.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally and $999.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally X, the latter representing a big increase on Asus’ current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a> model.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That, at least, won’t quite make it the most expensive Windows handheld around, as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-review">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> has also hit (give or take a penny) the one-grand mark in recent months. But still, this looks an awful lot like the effects of US tariff policies, with the added cost of importing Taiwan- and China-made hardware being passed down to aspiring owners. It’s a process Microsoft’s console business will be familiar with, its current generation of lounge-dwelling Xboxes having hiked their prices twice in the past year, with big green fingers pointing at macroeconomic conditions on both occasions.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s UK price merely matches that Asus’ 2024 predecessor, while upgrading its innards with a newer, faster AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU. The ROG Xbox Ally, mind, still seems like something of a wildcard. It’s only £21 more than the equivalent 512GB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, and £50 less than the already budget-minded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-review">Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS</a>. Yet mystery surrounds its own APU, the Ryzen Z2 A, a chip whose four cores and ageing RDNA 2 graphics processor gives it specs largely in line with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. If performance is a match as well, then it’ll struggle with the GPU-threshers that are modern 3D games.</p><p>That said, Microsoft and Asus aren’t just banking on framerates. The ROG Xbox Ally duo will be the first Windows 11-powered handhelds to include the operating system’s new, bespoke, Xbox-branding gaming mode, where many of Win11’s extraneous guff remains switched off at launch to preserve speed and batter life. It’ll have a more handheld-friendly UI than standard Windows as well, potentially wiping out a major advantage that SteamOS has always held over its desktop-tuned rival.</p>
<p>I’ll be seeing whether this mode will be worth the money, especially for stateside punters, with a review prior to the handhelds’ October 16th launch date. That’s assuming they’re not partaking in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">ongoing boycott calls</a> against Microsoft for their alleged dealings with the Israeli military, including providing access to Azure cloud storage and AI tools for the purpose of running a mass surveillance programme against Palestinians. Microsoft have, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">reportedly</a>, since revoked this access.</p>
