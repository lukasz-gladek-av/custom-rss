            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is a bit of a departure from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy's</a> usual games, given that it's a three-player multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a>. The shooty bit is nothing new, that's pretty typical of Remedy's games, even if the shooting always has something slightly off about it. It's the multiplayer angle that sets it apart, and, funnily enough, the fact that Remedy don't always make shooting feel all that great, so it's left me curious as to how it actually plays. I'm assuming some of you feel the same way, and there's some sort of good news: you can sign-up to playtest it this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, big asterisk here. Remedy notes that "due to the limited capacity of this Closed Technical Test, a sign-up does not guarantee access," meaning I would like it if you don't leave a comment blaming me for getting you all excited. That's just the way these tests go, I don't make the rules! 
</p>
<p>
You might want to get yourself signed-up soon though, the test kicks off in a couple of days on May 15th at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 4pm EEST. It'll then run until May 19th, 1:59pm PDT / 4:59pm EDT / 9:59pm BST / 11:59pm EEST, so you'll have a good few days to try it out. The test will be available on PC, of course, as well as those strange things called "consoles" I've heard so much about, like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, and you can sign-up right <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If FBC: Firebreak has somehow flown under your radar, and if it's looking a bit familiar, that's because it's a spinoff of Control (the FBC in its name standing for Federal Bureau of Control). The game is set after the events of the original Control, meaning the Bureau is still having to deal with all the Hiss and weird nonsense that goes on there. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, but in Remedy's universe. A strong concept honestly!
</p>
<p>
Not long to go until it's out either, as the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-will-release-this-june">slated for a June 17th release</a>.

            <p>
More than two years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft's</a> last mass round of layoffs, the company is laying off a huge amount of staff once again. As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a>, the tech giant is laying off 3% of employees across the entire company, meaning all levels, teams, and geographies. While nothing has been directly confirmed as of yet, this does include the possibility that some games studios it owns will be affected too - we'll provide an update if there is one.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company will "continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The spokesperson also said that one objective of the layoffs is to reduce layers of management. As always, a ridiculously heartless way to frame such a thing. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As of last June, Microsoft had around 228,000 employees, meaning a little under 7000 workers could be out of work soon. This is by far the biggest round of layoffs the company has enacted since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, though 650 workers were put out of employment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">last September too</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that these layoffs come after Microsoft reported that their net income increased by 18% year-on-year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">just this April</a>. Doesn't exactly scream a company that desperately needs to make cuts.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's unclear if any games studios under Microsoft's ownership have been affected by this decision. But as a reminder, based on the stats of an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">unofficial games industry layoffs tracker</a>, so far this year there's been an estimated 2200 jobs lost. 2024 saw around 14,600, 2023 around 10,500, and 2022 around 8500. Good luck to those affected.
