            <p>
Blizzard are adding a new premium virtual currency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> alongside player housing in the MMO's forthcoming Midnight expansion. It's called Hearthsteel, and is "purchased with real money using your Battle.net balance and used in turn to buy Housing items from the Battle.net shop and in-game shop," as detailed in a blog post this week. 
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736">comments</a> that the "vast majority" of housing items are and will continue to be earnable through play, with a "small fraction" sold for Hearthsteel. Even then, you'll be able to buy items sold for Hearthsteel using WoW Tokens derived from in-game gold. Housing items "tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop", and nor will "thematically important decor that players know and love". Hearthsteel is strictly for homey boondoggles: there are "no plans to use it for the Trading Post, mounts, transmogs, or pets".
</p>
<p>
All well and good. But Blizzard's reasons for adding a new premium currency to a game that was rubbing along well enough without seem sketchy.
</p>
<p>
As the developers themselves put it in that blog post, "why bother when we already have a Battle.net balance?" They justify the introduction of Hearthsteel by noting firstly that "when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties". To which I can only say: show your working, Blizzard, because I have no idea what you're referring to.
</p><p>
The developers add that buying things with real money "can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items", giving the example of buying a full set of chairs, candles and a dining table for a banquet. They argue that "using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient".
</p>
<p>
I'm... not really seeing it, and neither are the Wowsers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq6li7/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzards-reason-for-adding-premium-currency-to-world-of-warcraft-after-21-years-of-doing-just-fine-without-one-has-everyone-worried-about-player-housing/">PCGamer</a>). As one user points out, why not just let players put multiple purchases into a shopping cart rather than rolling out some newfangly Azeroth doubloons?</p>
<p>It seems likely that the real rationale for Hearthsteel is the same rationale that informs purchaeable virtual currencies at large: they cloud how much you're actually spending in real money terms, and often wangle you into spending too much by flogging the virtual currency in set amounts, rather than letting you buy exactly as much as you need. The addition of housing to WOW Midnight is sure to inspire a microtransaction boom - I guess this is just Blizzard adding a little more grease to the chute.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a consumer advocacy group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-european-consumer-watchdog-wants-you-to-be-able-to-buy-exactly-as-much-in-game-currency-as-you-need-not-fixed-chunks">called upon the European parliament to end such predatory practices in videogames</a>, but a huge number of publishers rely upon virtual currencies, especially in the realm of free-to-play. Time to bang that drum again, while you agonise over the interior of your Razorwind Shore chalet.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> has its first public patch, which encompasses over 350 fixes. Among the bigger things it smacks with the heal-o-spanner (an actual game development tool, traditionally carved from the base of a Taito arcade machine) is the Steams achievements system, which will no longer shower players in plaudits they haven't earned. On the plus side, you'll now earn achievements even if you activate the "allow ahistorical" game rule.
</p>
<p>I grasp at those relatively intelligible nuggets like somebody lunging for the doorhandle in a room full of bees. I do not play Europa Universalis 5. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">That review gig</a> went to Brendy, who was anointed many months ago as our human sacrifice to this particular god of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. Brendy is now more number table than man. He bleeds - erm, well, I can't even say what he bleeds, because I'm not hip to the Europa Universalis terminology. As such, I'm a poor choice to write up the game's first set of patch notes, but what can you do. Here are the apparent highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3450310/view/589535332141105331?l=english">as detailed on Steam</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fixed more than 350 bugs (not counting Translation-related number of errors fixed, which you can find in its own section)</li>
<li>Fixed the scope type for Achievement triggers, which was triggering several errors, along with many other minor fixes to them; also, activating the "Allow Ahistorical" game rule now doesn't block getting Achievements</li>
<li>Fixed several CTDs</li>
<li>Made several fixes to Personal Unions, especially to AI Union Law voting, making it less spammy</li>
<li>Fixed an issue making the Timurid spawning player event to not work properly</li>
<li>The 'Claim French Throne' peace treaty during the 'Hundred Years' War' situation no longer requires you to be senior in a PU already</li>
<li>The events that convert Hussite pops for Bohemia during the 'Hussite Wars' situation are now converting much more aggressively and impactfully</li>
<li>Japanese clans will now properly lose their clan's foreign buildings when being landed after the 'Sengoku Jidai' situation starts</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the notes span all aspects of the game, from whether or not the Earldom of Ulster is a Vassal of the Pale, through the addition of province capital map markers, to ensuring that there are "proper reasons for countries to join Autocephalous Patriarchates". WTF is an Autocephalous Patriarchate. Some kind of octopus grandad? Can you conquer things with it? If you're reading these notes, you've likely played the game and I look forward to your generous explanations.
</p><p>Europa Universalis 5 seems to be going down well among players. It and Paradox stablemates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and Hearts Of Iron IV are currently congregating in the high 20s on Steam's 100 Most Played. They've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> sandwiched between them like a strip of horse jerky. If you're keen on EU5, but are having trouble running it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-your-pc-is-too-puny-to-launch-europa-universalis-5-theres-a-secret-very-low-graphics-preset">this workaround for lower-spec graphics cards might be of interest</a>.</p>
