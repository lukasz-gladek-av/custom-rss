            <p>In what has become fine tradition, I have learned of an amazing mod on the same day I have learned that the mod has been kiboshed by publishers. The mod in question is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel. My brother did a "friendly takedown" on me once, and my elbow still doesn't bend the right way.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-5-mod-recreating-gta-4s-map-nuked-after-6-years-of-work-because-people-noticed-and-rockstar-insisted-on-a-friendly-takedown-if-you-know-what-i-mean/">PCGamer</a>, team member NK Jellman broke the news on the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/worldtravel">Discord</a>. "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project," he wrote. "We appreciate all the support that the project has received, and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series."</p>

<p>This may seem a very cheerful way to announce that six years of work have been for naught, but Jellman insists World Travel have nothing but love for Our Friends At Rockstar, to say nothing of Their Friends At Parent Company Take-Two. "We've noticed a lot of misconceptions and theories surrounding our latest announcement and would like to make a few things clear," added NK Jellman in a later Discord post. "This isn't a DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim], rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive." </p><p>Prior to its mutually agreed destruction, the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project brought back the entirety of GTA 4's warped New York complete with NPCs, the subway, the police forces, civilian traffic, car models, radio stations, and optional HD textures. All this for the low, low price of nothing at all.</p>
<p>Rockstar and Take-Two have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5-ai-mod-shot-down-by-take-two-even-as-rockstar-relax-policy-on-modding">track record</a>, of course, for bringing the hammer down on more ambitious GTA mods, though the criteria for a "friendly takedown" or worse remain ambiguous. This isn't the only <a href="https://fivemx.com/free/mlo/liberty-city/">GTA 5 Liberty City mod</a>. You could take it all as evidence that Rockstar are working on their own GTA 4 update, but according to reports <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-and-gta4-remasters-reportedly-scrapped-after-gta-trilogy-debacle">they shelved such plans in 2022</a> to focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The world looked upon the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and saw that it was good. Or is it? Observe its enlarged, bezel-shaved screen. Its all-black colour scheme. Its redesigned, more sculpted controllers. Clearly, this is a naked attempt at ripping off and cashing in on the <em>real</em> best gaming handheld of 2025, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>I, for one, won’t stand for it. Here are five reasons why everyone excited about the Switch 2 is wrong, and should buy a Steam Deck instead. Or maybe the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, that one’s better.</p>

<h3>1. The Switch 2’s shoulder triggers don’t travel as far</h3>
<p>Look at that tiny clearance betwixt button and chassis. Sir, your travel depth is as shallow as your knowledge of ergonomics.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Steam-Deck-shoulder-buttons.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>Now behold the vast, deep-pressing girth of the Steam Deck triggers – you could land a plane on that, and not just because I’ve massively zoomed in the photo.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-thumbstick.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<h3>2. The Switch 2 still uses convex thumbsticks, ignoring current thumb shape trends</h3>
<p>I know over twenty people and none of them have a single thumb, let alone two, that curves inwards at the tip. As such, the Switch 2’s thumbsticks make no sense, unlike the concave sticks of the Steam Deck that will nestle your digits like a kitten in a fruit bowl.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Nintendo-Switch-2-vents.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<h3>3. The Switch 2 vents are smaller so you can’t huff as much vent-smell</h3>
<p>I don’t care <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-huffing-your-steam-deck-vent-fumes-valve-plead-as-players-obsess-over-new-deck-smell">what Valve says</a>, this is my right as a consumer. Are you going to let Nintendo take away your rights?</p>

</figure>
<h3>4. The Switch 2 controllers can’t transform into gaming mice</h3>
<p>This is actually a feature of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, rather than the Steam Deck. But the Steam Deck is a better handheld than the Legion Go, and since the Switch 2’s lack of improvised mouse sensors make it worse than the Legion Go, that means it’s also worse than the Steam Deck.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>5. The Switch 2 runs Mario Kart and I hate Mario Kart because my friend Nathan always beats me at it</h3>
<p>Why should the best driver be determined by the contents of magic boxes, it’s a stupid game</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
