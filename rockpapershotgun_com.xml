        <p>A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an "enigma of success"</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have published a memo recently sent to staff by CEO Sayta Nadella, which addresses the strange fact of Microsoft reporting net income in the ultrabillions while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laying off thousands of supposedly "treasured colleagues"</a>. Most of the blog is a gusty, jargony paean to generative AI technology, in which Microsoft have made vast investments, and how it is going to "empower everyone to create their own tools" and create a "local surplus" of Ability To Do Stuff in Microsoft dominions worldwide.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>

Nothing in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">blog</a> directly addresses what Nadella characterises as the "seeming incongruence" of Microsoft being richer than all of the Roman emperors combined, and still taking a blowtorch to video game studios like ZeniMax Online Studios, King, Rare and Sledgehammer Games. But I guess it's nice that they've recognised that the optics are weird.
</p>
<p>
"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella writes. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.
</p>
<p>
"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he continues. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding."
</p>
<p>
Ah, whomst amongst us can fathom the dissonant enigma of trillion dollar corporations spontaneously having layoffs happen to them, while doleful executives float by on golden balloons, scratching their heads with bloody hacksaws. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sources-suggest-that-staff-laid-off-at-king-will-be-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-helped-to-create">reportedly</a> been replacing developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> with the generative AIs they helped to "train". Satya Nadella is apparently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-surprising-way-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-uses-ai-to-consume-podcasts-on-his-commute/">a religious genAI user</a>, and I do wonder whether that's a "local surplus" of capacity there that could justify some further cost-cutting, as per the glorious mysteries of progress.

            <p>Whimsy, grimdark, <em>and</em> gambling? And a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> to boot?! In <em>my</em> 2025 indie game? Eh, go on then. It looks neat. The trailer below features a desolate, hellish area called "The Pläins öf Päin" (umlauts mine) inhabited by lone egg idiot named 'eggo'. A curse on the egg idiot and his cracked shell, and a curse on the world for allowing this kind of tomfoolery to proliferate unchallenged.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slots-and-daggers">Slots &amp; Daggers</a> is by Friedemann, whose previous game was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-teeny-tiny-townbuilder-is-the-pint-sized-townscaper-ive-been-waiting-for">Katharine-approved</a> tiny townbuilder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/summerhouse">Summerhouse</a>. "After my last game, I wanted to make something radically different," says Friedemann. "Something faster, with numbers, fights and goblins!". Angry caffeinated math goblins, you say? Here are some other features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers">from Steam</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fun slot machine</li>
<li>Weird fantasy world</li>
<li>Crude drawings of strange little guys</li>
<li>Retro visuals</li>
<li>Crunchy hip hop drum machines</li>
<li>Addictive arcade gameplay that goes “pling” a lot</li>
<li>Numbers! Fights! Goblins!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"To make this game I combined a lot of things I deeply love – weird fantasy worlds, crude drawings of strange little guys, old school crunchy hiphop drum machines and addictive arcade games that go “PLING PLING PLING” as they spit out little coins – with classic roguelike mechanics," says Friedemann. They also warn that this is a solo project, and as such "doesn’t offer 80+ hours of content like games developed by bigger teams."</p>
<p>As delighted by both the crunchy drum machines and chucklesome weirdos as I am, I do despair a bit that anyone feels the need to avert potential gamer rage by clarifying that their project doesn't last as long as a CRPG. This isn't a slight on the developer, of course. Going by a sample of one (me), literally everyone who has ever played a videogame before is a massive idiot, and you can't be too careful. Can't wait for the enraged Steam review at exactly 79 hours of playtime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gamings-only-three-genres-have-inevitably-converged-into-grimdark-balatro-with-a-whimsical-egg-idiot]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will get a New Game+ mode on 29th July, Ubisoft have announced in a video about their summer plans for the feudal Japanese <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> stab-me-do. They're also working on a free Assassin's Creed Shadows update that lets you fast-forward the time of day, an ability that would certainly serve me well right now, as I contemplate the seven grim hours of video game journalism that separate me from the weekend.</p><!--more-->
<p>The New Game+ mode will reset story progression, discovered locations and objective progress, but will carry over your character level, gear, knowledge rank, and hideout progression. It'll let you start from the very beginning of the game, or skip the prologue to when you first inherit the hideout.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will also raise the level cap from 60 to 80, and are introducing new knowledge and mastery skill ranks together with new upgrades for hideout buildings, in particular the forge. Fans of live-served busywork can look forward to a third shadow project encompassing new resources, datafiles and animus-themed rewards.</p>
<p>It'll all be followed by one of those much-trumpeted "quality of life" updates at the beginning of September. This will let you speed the sun across the sky at whim, unfog the map by completing every single viewpoint in a region, and uncap the cutscene frame-rate (on PC only). </p>
<p>Ubisoft, if you want to improve the quality of my life specifically, please can you dispatch some of your best shinobi to menace my landlord? The hallway light has been flicking on and off for 18 months straight. Alternatively, please dispatch some of your best shinobi to fix the hallway light.</p>
<p>Finally, Ubisoft have slapped a release date on their Claws of Awaji expansion - September 16th. Access to the DLC is included with preorders, so if you're of the preordering persuasion, please resist the urge to buy it twice over.</p>
<p>Chaser: the video above harbours one of those Animus glitches with which Ubisoft are wont to tease future product announcements. I've screencapped it below. Please enjoy your continuing immersion in a simulation that has commodified the possibility of escape.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has apparently been a success for Ubisoft. It "delivered on its expectations" with five million players since launch, according to CEO Yves Guillemot, though Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/UBISOFT-ENTERTAINMENT-4719/actualite/Transcript-Ubisoft-Entertainment-SA-Q1-2026-Sales-Trading-Statement-Call-Jul-22-2025-50576409/">overall financial performance during their last financial quarter</a> was "mixed". Our Brendy was also mixed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>. "A beautiful recreation of 16th century Japan is stained with the clumsy ink of an uninspiring revenge tale," he wrote, "but take your time sneaking through castles and visiting temples to get the most from an impressive open world."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient]]></content:encoded>
