            <p>
Hitman developer Io Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-james-bond-game-project-007-is-coming-from-the-makers-of-hitman">James Bond game</a> has been reannounced with a proper title, 007 First Light. It also has some new key art, which confirms some important Facts: unlike Hitman's depthless master mimic Agent 47, James Bond has hair, formed into a neat side-parting by the passage of a narrowly escaped bullet. He also has ears, a high-collared leather jacket, and a gun. 
</p>
<p>
Or what looks like a gun. He could be just doing a finger pistol to fake us out. I do not trust this particular James Bond. He is, after all, a cousin of Agent 47, that barcode-blazoned Fury peering out of every mirror. Io Interactive's James Bond doesn't even have a face right now. The face is hopefully forthcoming in the world premiere later this week during Summer Game Fest 2025, along with James Bond's legs and feet. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Why no, I'm not padding out a nothingburger of a news story. I'm just artfully buying James Bond time to circle behind you and karate chop you in the neck. Let these be the final words you ever read: the world premiere will include "never-before-seen footage". Who knows, I might be at SGF in person to check it out.
</p>
<p>
Here is what little we know about Io Interactive's Bond game so far. It's a prequel story, as suggested by the marketing catchphrase "earn the number", featuring a brand new 007 who is not based on any of the movie ones. No fear of a Brosnan/Moore turf war in the comments, then.</p>
<p>Io are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactives-james-bond-game-will-be-an-origin-story-with-its-own-007">"rediscovering new sides of the agent fantasy with James Bond"</a>. The translation here could be: "we're trying to work out how to do stealth in a gameworld where we're contractually forbidden from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-humour-evolved-because-of-47s-penchant-for-disguises">murdering chefs with homing briefcases while dressed as a clown</a>". I feel like the easiest way to square that circle would be to make a Bond game in the tradition of the older Bond films, less the sexism. Go back to Bond at its daftest and most gadget-driven, long before Daniel Craig rolled up with his bulletproof glower. Agent 47 would have done well in that era.

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian now off doing their own thing and making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-larian-discuss-making-two-new-games-at-once-in-practice-we-will-probably-be-miserable">multiple games that aren't Baldur's Gate 4</a>, BG IP owners Wizards of the Coast have just revealed something that might help fill that void. They've agreed to a publishing deal that'll see relatively new studio Giant Skull create a new game set in the D&amp;D universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/respawn-veteran-stig-asmussen-forms-giant-skull-to-build-aaa-single-player-games">Giant Skull</a> were founded by Stig Asmussen, director of stuff like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and God of War 3, back in March 2024, and said way back then that it'd be aiming to make "gameplay-driven, story-immersed action-adventure games".</p>
<p>Well, they get points for sticking to that goal thus far. This WotC-published game they're working on (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/wizards-of-the-coast-and-giant-skull-announce-original-dungeons-dragons-action-adventure-game-for-consoles-pc">Gematsu</a>) is an "all-new, single-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons" that'll be coming to console and PC at some point between now and the end of time.</p>
<p>"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen said in a press release, "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.”</p>
<p>"In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game," added Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro digital gaming president John Hight, "Worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play. We look forward to revealing more about this brand-new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game in the future."</p>
<p>So, concrete details about the game and what it'll end up looking like are pretty scarce right now - as you'd expect for a thing that's only just tied the publishing knot. There's no indication of how it may or may not be tied to the BG games we've already gotten, or whether any of the characters BG3 famously inspired War and Peace-length fanfictions about will star in it.</p>
<p>Given the fact it hasn't been declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">an RPG</a>, it could well turn out to have very little in common with BG3, aside from the obvious D&amp;D connection. We'll just have to wait, ponder our orbs like those coastal wizards, and see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
