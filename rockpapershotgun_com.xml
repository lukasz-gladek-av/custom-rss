            <p>Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.</p>
<p>And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">Bloomberg</a>, the US DoD's list of Chinese military companies dates back to an executive order given by recently re-elected president Donald Trump in 2020, which sought to prevent US companies from investing in entities with ties to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>Formally known as <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/07/2025-00070/notice-of-availability-of-designation-of-chinese-military-companies">Section 1260H</a>, the list is updated annually and currently runs to 134 companies, including phone manufacturer Huawei. Being on there doesn't mean the companies in question are immediately banned from doing business with the USA, but it puts pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction them. This might scare away investors: the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">reports</a> that Tencent has already seen a share price fall in Hong Kong as of today, Tuesday 7th January.</p><p>Tencent, naturally, say the whole thing is an error, and that the designation will have no material effect on their activities. "We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti commented to the BBC. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."</p>
<p>I'm no scholar of superpower geopolitics, but my understanding is that all this forms parts of US efforts to contain China both economically, and in terms of the military applications and connections of Chinese tech companies and research organisations. Here's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/article/3180636/dod-releases-list-of-peoples-republic-of-china-prc-military-companies-in-accord/">a US Department of Defence press release from 2022</a> which spells out the thinking. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the PRC Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise are acquired and developed by PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities. Section 1260H directs the Department to begin identifying, among other things, Military-Civil Fusion contributors operating directly or indirectly in the United States."</blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer scale of Tencent's operations - they also work in generative AI and cloud computing and own WeChat, one of the largest social media networks - it seems probable that they have military connections somewhere. But then again, so do many large US tech companies, like Activision-Blizzard and Microsoft. Many are the links between the tech biz and the world's armed forces.</p><p>All this comes amid news that Tencent are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">considering a buyout of Ubisoft with the aid of the founding Guillemot family</a>. It also follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-epic-games-directors-step-down-after-us-department-of-justice-investigate-games-companies-under-antitrust-laws">resignation of two Tencent-appointed Epic Games directors</a>, in response to a US Department of Justice investigation into potential antitrust violations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There’s a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steamos">SteamOS</a> handheld outside of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> range.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First off: <em>finally</em>. Windows 11 is the obvious choice for non-Valve manufacturers to base their dinky rigs around, but it’s proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">time</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">time</a> again that its lack of natural affinity for small screens and thumbstick controls isn’t entirely made up for by its native games compatibility. SteamOS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">might not be supported everywhere</a> but UX-wise, it is a far better match for handhelds, while still offering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> for more Windows-like flexibility. Its spread across third-party machines can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Legion Go S! It’s simplified and shrunk down considerably from the original Legion Go, adopting a more traditionaol fixed chassis, dropping the weight from 854g to 730g, and downsizing the display to an 8in, 1200p, 120Hz IPS panel. Fine by me – the Legion Go’s 1600p, nearly 9in screen was nice to look at but often too much for its own processor to handle. Speaking of, the Legion Go S will be powered by your choice of either the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme that the Legion Go had, or AMD's brand-new Ryzen Z2 Go. No word on how the latter will perform, though it's probably not as quick as the Z1 Extreme, as that one will send the Legion Go S's price up to $729 whereas the Ryzen 2 Go version will be just $599.</p>

<p>Speaking of choice, there'll also be a Windows 11 edition of the Legion Go S, perfect for those who rolled their eyes disapprovingly through that second paragraph. That will go on sale this January, several months ahead of the SteamOS version’s May release.</p><p>Either way, the Legion Go S will come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect</a> joysticks, a teensy lil’ trackpad on the right (which looks more like a navigation aid than the Deck’s big, gaming-ready haptic pads), and a 55Whr battery, which is 5WHr up on the original Legion Go. Between that and the lower-specced display, hopefully that will translate into lengthier battery life, another weakness of the bigger brother.</p>
<p>Hardware is rarely improved by removing its more unique and interesting features, but in the Legion Go S’s case, I do reckon it could get away with trading away those Switch-style controllers. SteamOS will just naturally make it a more comfortable handheld to use, and in offering 1TB of storage for $599, it even manages to undercut the $649 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> on its usual price advantage. It’ll still need to make a case for itself on performance and battery life, but it’s definitely an interesting prospect. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-the-lenovo-legion-go-right-up-to-the-moment-i-broke-it">Hope I don’t break it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
