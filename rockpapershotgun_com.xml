            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tower-of-fantasy">Tower of Fantasy</a>? It was one of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>-ish gacha games, with its particular twist, so to speak, being that it's sort of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>. I say sort of, because it's described as a shared open world, meaning you can see other players, and there are some MMO elements, but its monetisations are much more gacha like. Or, well, they are until tomorrow, November 25th, as in quite a big move developer Hotta Studio is stripping Tower of Fantasy of all of its gacha elements.
</p>
<p>
That is in one new server, anyway, <a href="https://tof.perfectworld.com/eneu/news/notice/20251121/259439.shtml">the Warp server</a>. Once there, you'll no longer need to pull for weapons and matrices (bits of gear), you can get all of that for free like by simply playing different events and "daily gameplay." With this there'll be a bit more of a traditional trade system, alongside a new in-game currency called dark crystals, where you can buy and, well, trade for resources and the like.
</p>
<p>
There'll also be a new season system! Not like the weather, like game seasons. These'll come with different progression styles and play modes, there's rewards to be earned like outfits, typical season stuff, though I'm not entirely sure if this will be a thing you pay for or not. On top of that, to make it much more like an MMO, there's some new social stuff, such as a new place called the Crew Base, a space you can just sort of hang out in with other players.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, specifics are weirdly scant, which is perhaps a misstep given how the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2064650/Tower_of_Fantasy/#app_reviews_hash">isn't exactly universally beloved right now</a>. Still, I do wonder if the old ways of gacha are on the way out. Games like Duet Night Abyss have decided to forgo them, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">upcoming mashup between Spider-Man and GTA</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/despite-all-appearances-upcoming-f2p-open-world-rpg-ananta-isnt-a-gacha-game-only-charging-for-cosmetics-and-furniture/">isn't going the gacha route</a>. Here's hoping more games follow that path.

            <p>
Look, I have my fair share of problems with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, but to give credit where credit is due, after announcing their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">foray into publishing</a> earlier this year, they've lined up a suite of games. Dead Take, a psychological horror complete with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Neil Newbon and Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-take-is-an-fmv-horror-with-midsomer-murders-ben-starr-and-casualtys-neil-newbon">launched earlier this year</a>, Truckful just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-evil-ghost-lorry-in-truckfuls-demo-nearly-ate-me-and-the-lady-who-did-a-headstand-in-my-bed">looks like a delight</a>, and now there's Vision Quench, a game for freaks like me who like it when fantasy gets a bit techy.
</p>
<p>
How do I begin to explain Vision Quench? In genre terms, it describes itself as an "online co-op dark fantasy looter shooter," but I never think genres are a great selling point. The about section is a bit more tantalising. You find yourself in a place called the Green Tower, which you must climb to get the Sweepstakes Code. Along the way, you'll need to collect various cursed commodities to perform "the ritual," or alternatively consume them to gain certain abilities.
</p>
<p>
The whole setting is suitably fantastical, and modern at the same time. The setting is appropriately dungeon, but there are computers where "dark mining used for dark rituals" take place, toilets, soda pop cans, ventilation systems, vending machines, all of this amongst hand-monsters and evil rats and other mysteries.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically, the game reminds me of renders from fantasy games you might find in magazines from the '90s, there's a colourful fuzz to it that's hard to pinpoint elsewhere. Your character can wear a bucket for a helmet while wearing a camo top, high-vis trousers, and what I think are Crocs, all while another friend has donned a knights' helm with a pistol in hand. It is fantasy by way of four friends mucking about in a digital realm they may or may not have hacked, and it is greatly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
That is four friends to be precise, this is one of those kinds of games that I still don't know what to refer to as, but if I reference <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> or Peak you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date attached to Vision Quench just yet, but it should be releasing sometime in 2026. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3488690/Vision_Quench/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <p>
TimeSplitters is one of those weird series that I look back on quite fondly despite never having owned a single one of the games as a wistful youth. I think I've got one kicking around somewhere these days, but back then the only way I would play it was at a friend's house, us messing about, not doing a very good job at co-op in the main story, me failing to beat my friend in multiplayer because I was crap at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> games. And now, here we are, with a fanmade rework that's been 13 years in the making finally released, offering unto me a chance to relish in some nostalgia, but New.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a> before, it's a fan project that's sort of a remake, sort of a best of compilation of the various games' maps, modes, challenges, and story bits. As the website puts it, it's "not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title."
</p>

<p>
Admittedly I do think the project has that look about it that many remakes do, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> remakes for example, where in an effort to look modern, they lose a bit of atmosphere. At the same time, I like how crunchy the gameplay looks. Punchy shooting, punchy punches, a lot of goofiness about it that you'd expect from such a series. Plus it does deserve some commendation for actually existing as a thing you can just have for free. And the team did apologise for the wait too on the game's website; "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever."
</p><p>
It should be noted that this is just an early access release, so don't expect it to be feature complete just yet. There's a bunch of maps and arcade modes, a whole load of weapons and challenges, and you can play the entirety of the first game in co-op as it stands. It looks real neat honestly! And if you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">head to its website</a> to download the early access release.
