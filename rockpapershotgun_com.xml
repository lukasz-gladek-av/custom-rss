            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, but shut your yap and don't tell anyone, because developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games appear to have revealed this early by accident. You didn't hear any of this from me. I ain't a rat. I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who is a rat - those dirty snitches over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mafia-the-old-countrys-release-date-has-appeared-online/">Very Gorgonzola Computing</a>. They claim somebody put up a Steam blog post that gave the big date away, in advance of a probable reveal at PAX East. The post has now been edited. Find a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lmimffmqt32l">copy of the original on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country takes the crime-does-pay series back to Sicily in the 1900s. It's going for comparison with the Robert de Niro segments of Godfather: Part 2, in other words. The story follows Enzo Favara, and takes you from a childhood of servitude in Sicily's sulfur mines to a promising career with the Torrisi crime family. It's said to be more action-adventure, less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> than the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>. I don't have any particular thoughts on the new direction beyond that I am unreasonably attracted to the key artwork of the handsome shotgun lying in a crate of absolutely radiant lemons.</p>
<p>The new Mafia is also of interest because it's from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, which is slated  to launch on consoles this year (GTA 6 PC release date any time, Rockstar). Take-Two will definitely not be publishing them in close proximity. As when deducing the presence of black holes by monitoring the distorted light from nearby stars, it's possible we can whittle down GTA 6's release date by extrapolation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last year, Spanish developers Tequila Works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers-tequila-cancel-game-and-lay-off-staff">cancelled a game</a>, laid off staff, and finally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tequila-works-the-studio-behind-rime-and-the-sexy-brutale-has-filed-for-insolvency">filed for insolvency</a> in the face of "prolonged market conditions", after losing funding from Tencent. Founders Ra√∫l Rubio and Luz Sancho departed the studio in the process.</p>
<p>Now, what's left of Tequila are selling off all their assets in an open auction, including both published games like horror platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlight">Deadlight</a>, and a number of projects that were either in development or "ready for production". It all makes for a sad anatomy of the studio that gave us the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rime">Rime</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">the auction listings on Escrapalia</a>, Tequila Works had plenty on the boil. The first in-development project listed is The Ancient Mariner, "an open-world narrative action adventure, focused on human emotions as the driving force of the gameplay". Clunky elevator pitch notwithstanding, this sounds like a follow-up to Rime, in that both projects reference Coleridge's poem Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. If you've completed Rime you'll know that the poetic parallel here goes beyond the title.</p>
<p>The second project listed is Dungeon Tour, which sounds a lot more lighthearted. It's described as "a conceptual mix between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>" for up to four players. The premise is that you're guiding sightseers around procedurally generated catacombs. What if Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli had to shepherd a bunch of goofs wearing fanny packs with Goblin phrasebooks? What if Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but with a group of retirees in palm-print shirts rather than a rolling ball of fire? Yeah, I could see myself having fun with that.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's Brawler Crawler, which was to be about developing a combat style in a "chaotic urban universe" of procedurally generated streets. This is the only one of the three in-dev projects that's described as having been cancelled in the auction, so perhaps this is the game Tequila Works shelved last November.</p>
<p>Four other "unreleased video game concepts" are mentioned in the listing, each consisting of "creative, narrative and visual documentation, and reserved rights". They are Frozen Outpost, Mr. Bones, Hungry Cities, and Under A Logger's Moon.</p>
<p>The auction naturally doesn't detail the fates of Tequila Works staff following last year's bankruptcy announcement - at the time, they were expected to "fulfil their responsibilities" according to Eurogamer.es sources, despite management not necessarily having the ability to pay them. Since then, several Tequila members have posted that they're looking for new work on LinkedIn, amongst them <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jose-luis-lara-romero-761b5338_ive-been-part-of-tequila-works-for-six-and-activity-7265011388010397696-r2pi/?rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">senior sound designer Jose Luis Lara Romero</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-canela-lagunas-3522439_opentowork-ugcPost-7262144756124721153-ArhQ/?rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">senior game designer David Canela Lagunas</a>.</p>
<p>Others have posted tributes about their time working for or with Tequila. "They found me at a time when I was losing faith in my own career," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308119321564581888/">writes</a> Rob Yescombe, who was freelance narrative director and writer on Rime and VR game The Invisible Hours. "We made two wonderful games together, that have stood the test of time."</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Tequila Workers who are still looking for a new home.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
