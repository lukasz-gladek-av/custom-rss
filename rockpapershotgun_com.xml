            <p>
Heart Machine’s side-scrolling metroidvania platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> with a splash of Amanita Design’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creaks">Creaks</a>. The bulk of your enemies are household objects - vending machines, plant pots, office printers and other fittings that have become vessels for demons. From this premise springs a note of tragedy powerful enough to conquer my outrage at a game title that has brackets in it. The demons are not, in themselves, violent - it’s inhabiting the inanimate that maddens them. “Possessing something cold and dead is agony… so they lash out,” explains Rhem, a mortally wounded devil you meet in the prologue. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The demon invasion is also more of an uprising, triggered by a nefarious corporation, Agradyne, who have been bottling the fiends like bacteria and carrying out dreadful experiments. Or at least, such is my understanding after 20 minutes with a demo at a Devolver event last week. It all makes me feel positively awful about chain-whipping the hellspawn for power-up points. And yet. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
Aside from making me reconsider my prejudices against demons, Possessor is notable for some winsome anime character design. You are Luca, a snub-nosed, apple-cheeked teenager who loses her legs while trying to escape the interdimensional onslaught. Luca is saved from death by raven-haired hellboy Rhem, who is himself in need of a fresh body after getting his chest ripped open. With Rhem tagging along as one of the titular possessors, Luca both regrows her legs and acquires a sizzling set of knives, a combat grapple, a wall-kick, a double-jump, and more besides. It’s clearly a Faustian pact, possibly also a doomed romance, but hush now, away with your talk of Consequences – there are new abilities to unlock, and weapons to find.
</p>
<p>
The game is set in a huge, trashed, quarantined city with some kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a>-ass singularity popping off in the background. It’s a towering expanse of soft neon glows and gladiatorial shadows, very much a depth I’m willing to plumb, though I’m not yet blown away by the combat. 
</p>
<p>
It works well enough, once you adjust to some slightly curt animations, but so far, it’s playing the hits – dodge, combo, launch. I do like the ordinariness of the tools: one of the early secondary weapons is a computer mouse you swing by its cable.  See, this is why new computing tech isn’t automatically better computing tech. Can’t juggle underworld hooligans with a bluetooth connection, can you? Later you get a guitar – “shredding” is a word with at least two senses – and a hockey stick. 
</p>
<p>
I broke off playing the demo after I was saddled with the sub-objective of locating somebody’s eyeballs so that I could fool the retina scanners for a laboratory door. I stopped playing mostly because I was at an event and on the clock, but it’s also fair to say that being handed a key quest blunted the enthusiasm amassed by the world and characters. 
</p>
<p>
Still, this feels both more florid than many metroidvanias and more sensitive in its writing, as you might expect from some of the people behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a> and, less positively, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. I will end with the throwaway thought that the main characters remind me a bit of the lead characters from volleyball anime Haikyuu. Probably, a volleyball would make a sensible addition to Luca's arsenal. More stopping power than a hockey stick, surely? Anyway, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132890/Possessors/">read more about the demo on Steam</a>.

            <p>What's this? A game with big robots smashing each other to tiny little pieces above a large sci-fi cityscape, and we have <em>not</em> yet covered it. For shame. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play multiplayer robo-battler in which you fly around and wreck online foes at speeds no mere human should ever be exposed to, and it now has a release date, as announced in a flashy trailer at the Summer Game Fest. I have no idea if playing this will be as intense as the visual heart attack it looks to be. But maybe when it comes out next month I'll try it out. </p>

<p>It's due out on July 2nd. Mecha Break is set on our planet, post-catastrophe, where a shadowy organisation called, uh, S.H.A.D.O.W. have hired you as a pilot and cannonfodder in a grand and doubtless unending war. </p>
<p>"Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/">the Steam page</a>. "Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter." </p>
<p>Why that's basically all the flavours of live service you could possibly want, squished into one game. I don't know whether to be worried or impressed.</p>
<p>The shame I feel for not having covered Mecha Break thus far is only half a joke. Institutionally speaking, RPS has long welcomed the giant robots and robotic suits that smoke with the embers of battle. Whether that's the greeble and grit of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawken">Hawken</a>, the fearful mechmommies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a>, or the cocaine-infused mechamurder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycho-patrol-r">Psycho Patrol R</a>. I do love a big robot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The makers of the Yakuza games have revealed the title of the historical brawler they teased at last year's Game Awards, then known as "Project Century". The full name is Stranger Than Heaven, as unveiled at the Summer Game Fest. It's got a new trailer set in a smokey 1943, in which we meet the game's protagonist, and nod approvingly as he smashes a nose or two.</p>

<p>Nice fedora. The character we follow looks to be detectiving a bit. Knocking on doors and inspecting a cigarettes which will "draw immense hostility" if you choose to smoke them. Disgusting habit. The player also gets a petrol bomb thrown at them, they dodge a bullet, they throw a man off a bridge. Just everyday hijinks they got up to last century, those lovable scamps.</p>
<p>Although this sample of fighting goons and clearing out alleyways is set in wartime Japan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-makers-of-yakuza-are-working-on-project-century-a-new-third-person-brawler-set-in-1915">the previous trailer</a> was set in 1915. That means there's some jumping around in history going on. It'll be intersting to see what's going on here. An intergenerational story of fmaily, betrayal and redemption that'll span the entire 20th century? I'm not saying that's what's definitely going on - just speculatising - but if anyone can do that, the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio probably can.</p>
<p>Ah, but will it be on PC? Probably, although Sega aren't telling us how or when. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
