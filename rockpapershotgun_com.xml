            <p>Two theme parks are being planned based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>. Mojang are partnering with Merlin Entertainments to open the destinations, including rides, hotel rooms and shops, in the UK and US in 2026 and 2027. Merlin are the operator of existing theme parks and attractions including Alton Towers, Legoland, Sea Life, and Madame Tussauds.
</p>

<p>The Minecraft parks will be opened as part of an existing theme park or as new city centre attractions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/minecraft-theme-park-deal-uk-us-merlin-entertainments">according to The Guardian</a>. Mojang and Merlin also have plans to expand to other countries and territories.
</p>
<p>These attractions won't be the first time Mincraft has crossed in the real world. Earlier this year, Mojang partnered with Supply + Demand to launch <a href="https://www.minecraftexperience.com/">Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue</a>, an "immersive, interactive Minecraft quest" in Plano, Texas. The partnership with Merlin seems an order of magnitude more ambitious, however.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is shaping up to have a busy few years, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">a live action movie on the way</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">a Netflix animated series. It could also be a big few years for UK theme parks, with </a><a href="https://universalukproject.co.uk/">Universal planning a potential park as well</a>.
</p><p>The biggest news for Minecraft is obviously that we just named it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game ever</a>. Yes, I will be taking my son to the Minecraft theme park, even if it just turns out to be a shed full of cardboard boxes. I can't resist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Based on anonymous sources and datamining</p>

            <p>Valve said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-want-to-make-another-steam-controller-happen">that they want to make a new Steam Controller</a> back in 2022, but such a thing might be getting closer to production, according to dataminer Brad Lynch.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Codename for Steam Controller 2 is 'Ibex'. Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)," Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316">tweeted</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>. "Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization".
</p>
<p>Deckard is reportedly the codename for a standalone VR headset from Valve. They have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">occasional and dull patent filings</a> in recent years that could be for such a headset. The "Roy" controllers are reportedly new motion controls designed for use with the new VR headset.
</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182">tweet</a>, Lynch says that the Roy controllers will "have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap".
</p>
<p>"I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named," Lynch writes.
</p>
<p>None of this is hard proof that any of this is actually happening. Valve have not announced any new hardware, other than last week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">limited edition white Steam Deck</a>. 
</p>
<p>It's possible I'm just posting this because I want it to be true. I've been using a Valve Index for four years and I've started to long for something with higher resolution screens. I can't bring myself to buy a Meta product, however, so I'm really hoping Valve eventually deliver.
</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is less immediately appealing, but I'd still be curious to see Valve take another swing at any of their past hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
