I am going to level with you. My awareness of Lort up until this point has been non-existent. Never heard of it before today, it's early access release day! But when you see a game called Lort, well, you at least need to take a little look. And as astronomically silly as the name is, it looks like a pretty neat, silly time, so, my predilection towards the inane has clearly worked out in my favour this time.
</p>
<p>
Lort is one of those trendy affordable co-op games, specifically of the action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> variety. Think something along the lines of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>, but with a fantasy setting, alongside some other key differences. While there are different adventurers to choose from, the bigger focus is on the weapons you can pick up, which range from what I think is a squid on a staff, to some fancy looking swords, to quite simply a gun. Or three guns taped to a stick! The Risk of Raininess of it comes back with different powerups you can pick up to help you take down waves of enemies.

You can play it solo if you like, but the main draw is eight-player co-op, though I can't tell you how enemy difficulty might scale depending on how many people are playing. I do wish that it was maybe a touch less memey on the whole, using words like swole, and chad, and muscle mommy, a lot of which is already pretty dated, but if I ignore the language the gameplay looks goofy in an entertaining way.
</p><p>
Anyway, currently the game is in early access, but it is apparently playable from start to finish. The game's first big update will introduce things like a new, froggish adventurer, a dagger weapon type, and more, with bigger plans for more playable adventures, an endless mode, biomes, and quest types. You can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956680/LORT/">here</a>.

            <p>
Given its lengthy, troubled development period, it will probably not come as any surprise to you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have announced today that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has been cancelled. This comes as part of a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">broader restructure at the company</a>, which will apparently focus on what they call five "specialised creative houses" to "reclaim creative leadership and restore sustainable growth."
</p>
<p>
Alongside the Prince of Persia remake, Ubisoft have also cancelled development on five other games, three of them apparently being completely new, and one being a mobile title. Seven other games they have in the works have been internally delayed as well. Details about these games are next to none, but the general idea behind this move is that Ubisoft want to focus on open world and live service games.
</p>
<p>
It also appears that more layoffs may be in Ubisoft's future too. We already knew that their Halifax studio is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">being shuttered</a>, but according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-details-major-company-reset-6-games-canned-7-delayed-and-2-studios-closed/">VGC</a>, the company is also considering the sale of other assets. On top of this, CFO Frederick Duguet said, "There are some people who will be refocused on other big projects, and some may leave the company." An exact figure wasn't specified in terms of staff members being moved or laid off.
</p>
<p>
In terms of these five new "creative houses," one of them is Vantage Studios, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">the subsidiary partially owned by Tencent</a>, which will focus on Ubisoft's tentpole series like Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six. Others will handle series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil (which suggests it's somehow still in development), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>, and even Prince of Persia, so clearly Ubisoft still intends to do something with the series.
</p><p>
The official Prince of Persia Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">shared a statement</a> with this to say of the cancellation: "While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents. Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise. Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia."
</p>
<p>
Solidarity with all those affected by the restructuring.
