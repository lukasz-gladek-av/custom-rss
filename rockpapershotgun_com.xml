            <p>
I'm not all that big on ranking games, truth be told - why would I want to catalogue a piece of art that way? But seeing as you have me at gunpoint (just pretend for me), I'll admit I'd probably put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a> in my top five. The platforming is tighter than any Mario entry, the art and soundtrack are stellar, and the story really hits home for me too.</p>
<p>You can imagine how excited I was when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, the follow-up from developer Extremely OK Games, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">announced</a>, and how upset I was when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-cancel-lush-platformer-earthblade-to-focus-on-smaller-scale-projects">cancelled a couple months back</a>. Still, we've been treated to a small taste of what the game might have been like in the form of a <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">mini-album with a select set of tracks from composer Lena Raine</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right off the bat you'll hear Raine's signature, synthy sound. Some tracks from the album are reminiscent of Celeste's score, while others feel completely fresh and unique. It definitely feels like it's going for a fantasy role-playing vibe - I’d love to know how this would have paired with the cancelled game’s action-platforming.
</p>

</span></p><p>
Raine explains over on the album's Bandcamp page that Earthblade "Across the Bounds of Fate" is more concept album than soundtrack. "The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste," she wrote. "I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can’t really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."
</p>
<p>
Apparently Raine took a lot of inspiration from older animation and film, like the "huge Yamaha synths" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> composer Vangelis, as well as the "weird textures and combination of old synths &amp; live strings of Joe Hisaishi’s score for Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," and the "haunting saxophone and percussive textures of Yoko Kanno’s work on Cowboy Bebop &amp; Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex." I think that Kanno influence can really be heard in particular on the sixth track, Poison in the Roots.
</p>
<p>
It's always quite gutting when a game gets cancelled, but I'm thankful to be able to hear a little bit of Earthblade's soundscape, especially given that 50% of the album's sales will be donated to <a href="https://translifeline.org/about/">Trans Lifeline</a>. Get on it!

            <p>Grand yet furtive robot action-adventure Steel Seed will launch on April 10th, developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/storm-in-teacup">Storm in a Teacup</a> and publishers ESDigital Games have announced. Not heard of Steel Seed before? You would've if I'd ever written up that demo build I played at last year's Game Developer Conference. I don't know why it's taken me this long to mention the game, given that it contains one of my favourite things in fiction: a machine the size of a world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Steel Seed you play Zoe, a nimble and upgradeable robot, and her flying drone acquaintance Koby. You're exploring a vast cybernetic undercity created by overclocked WALL-Es to preserve the last human survivors of a global apocalypse.</p>
<p>The overarching story is about "exploring the fine line between human and machine, trust and control, resilience and despair", but in the moment, Steel Seed is more about exploring the fine line between crouch-walk back-stabbing and open combat with electroswords and Koby's ranged attacks. Needless to say, you'll also be doing a lot of platforming: leaping to handholds, wall-running, sliding down ramps, all the classics.</p>

<p>I wasn't mesmerised by the jumpy-sneaky-slashy elements of the GDC 2024 build I played. It felt like a sturdy but essentially makeshift cobbling-together of parts from other action-adventures. I can't knock the environments, however, which consist of layer upon layer of unsleeping industrial machinery - gushing cyclopean smelters, sunset-sized reactor cores and turbiney wotsits made up of individually rotating and grippable sections.</p>
<p>The extra frisson of architectural intrigue is that Steel Seed takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's Blame!, among other megacity mangas. I haven't read Blame!, so my nearest parallels are other video games - last year's superbly unaccommodating spelunking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>, and Ninja Theory's ageing Serkis 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west">Enslaved: Odyssey To The West</a>.</p>
<p>If you like the sounds of all this, but you're umming and erring over my indifference to the combat and stealth, the good news is that Steel Seed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/">has a demo on Steam</a>. It includes the game's intro and gives you a taste of the robot-bashing and/or bamboozling ahead.

</p><p>Storm in a Teacup have form for moody sci-fi - their previous games include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-to-the-sun">Close To The Sun</a>, which Alice Bee (RPS in peace) found a little too Bioshlock in places but was otherwise quite pleased with. "Close To The Sun exists in a potential sweet spot for me, a mix of horror and leisurely exploration, and I enjoyed a lot of it," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/close-to-the-sun-review">wrote in our review</a>. "It excels at toying with you, particularly in the first half of the game, and paces itself so that you're constantly tense even when you have nothing to fear."</p>
