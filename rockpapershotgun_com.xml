            <p>
During a house clearout I recently discovered a cache of creative writing from my teenage years. Naturally, I now consider most of it to be unbearable. Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with "O Muse". BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amphora-hell">Amphora Hell</a>, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is sort of one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. "No evidence of my failure must remain," he bellows in the Itch preamble. "Prepare to be scrapped!"
</p><!--more-->
<p>
What follows is a sort of arcade pisstake of neurotic perfectionism and the way projects we deem write-offs may refuse to let go of our imaginations. It's a simple play, so simple that my previous sentence feels desperately overloaded.</p>
<p>As the amphora, you run right or left on a stack of lanes and moving platforms, trying to avoid twirling hammers that appear at random from either side. The challenge increases rapidly: stay intact for 40 seconds or so and the Kilnmaster's nightmarishly disembodied head will appear and coast towards you, purring threats like a demon vocoder. The unspoken objective is to last long enough to hear the entirety of the game's pulsing background track. I have yet to manage this.
</p>
<p>
I like this game because it's a self-deprecating introduction to creator June Flowers's <a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/">other experiments</a>, which range from "the first gunk-type game" to a game of stick and hoop played using interactive fiction mechanics. All of this is summarised as "brain poison for your brain poison", which describes a lot of the art I like.</p>
<p><a href="https://june-flower.itch.io/amphora-hell">You can download Amphora Hell for free on Itch</a>. If you get past the floating head stage, do let me know if there's anything weirder to report, and by all means share any of your own projects you now wish to destroy with flying hammers.

            <p>I tend to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> closer to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> than a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>. Balance? Leave me alone, for I am immersed in the stinky fantasy of being a sniveling Skaven bin-licker, commanding my slaves to mine useless gold purely because it irritates my dwarfish enemies.</p>
<p>As such, I'm not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too. <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/65">A new blog post</a> outlines the changes they're making to AI, and there's an <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/forums/72-campaign-ai-beta/threads/8980-how-to-download-the-campaign-ai-beta-on-steam">experimental beta branch available </a>right now if you want to test them out.</p>

<p>There's a fair bit of design talk in the blog, so I'll stick to the helpful "How will this affect you in-game?" explainers they've given. They're looking at three major areas in all: 'Query System', 'Aggression', and 'Faction Potential'.</p>
<p>The query system is how the AI detects enemies and potential enemies on the map. So, anyone who isn't them basically, given that it's Warhammer. The problem? Campaign AI prioritises defending its settlements when enemy forces are present, and 'enemy forces' hitherto included even the lowliest agent character. They're now making the enemy less likely to cower behind their walls at the merest whiff of a rambling troubadour weaving daisy chains on adjacent farmland. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"How will this affect you in-game? It means an AI controlled faction will no longer immediately assume a defensive posture and concentrate forces near/in settlements whenever any hostile agent ventures into their territory. This should enable AI factions to use resources that previously went to the defensive response for other purposes, e.g. raiding enemy territories, concentrating forces to break through defended positions."</p></blockquote>
<p>They're also aiming to make the AI better at assessing rival faction's strength, and more incentivised to declare war on other AI factions. I sort of love how vaguely sinister the word 'incentivise' is in this context, since its basically flipping a switch in someone's head that makes them angrier (which I seem to remember being the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Angron">actual lore behind a Warhammer 40k character</a>, actually.)</p>
<p>Finally there's 'faction potential', which basically governs how powerful a given faction is likely to grow. If you've noticed certain Dark Elves performing absurdly well in <em>every single campaign</em>, it's likely to do with their high potential. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Weâ€™ve made five tweaks to Faction Potential for this Beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>A slight increase of major AI faction strength versus minor AI factions</li>
<li>Slight increase of faction potential weight in auto resolve calculations</li>
<li>Lowered the minimum faction potential minor factions can have</li>
<li>Moderately increased the maximum faction potential bonus for AI factions under the shroud - this allows higher potential factions to defeat and conquer lower potential factions faster</li>
<li>Small increase of base faction potential for all factions on all difficulty levels"</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This should mean that major factions conquer the little guys faster and more often, increasing the chance they'll survive until late game, and also be less passive overall.</p>
<p>This can obviously change between campaigns, but here's <a href="https://youtu.be/EYLHQwGffHg">a quick timelapse</a> by YouTuber MonkeyBot of a campaign in the current beta. The Bloody Hands orcs seem to do a lot better than usual, and the Skaven don't usually do quite as well in my experience either. Also, the Ordertide has been well and truly krumped.</p>
<p>Will I be jumping in to try these changes any time soon? No. I have work to do and showers to take regularly, both of which will suffer horribly if I'm not careful. You should be careful, too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3s-ai-playing-smart-in-forge-of-the-chaos-dwarfs-is-as-miserable-as-it-is-brilliant">Good Twarhammer AI can be horrible</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
