            <p>If you're prone to passing the bread at the supermarket, totally forgetting you've already got plenty at home, picking some fresh up because you probably need bread, then realising later that you now own two full loafs with the same best before date, I have good news for you. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are taking action to stop something similar happening when people buy the game's Super Citizen Edition.</p>
<p>They're replacing the Steeled Veterans warbond in this special edition with a token that you'll be able to redeem for any one of the warbonds released for the game so far. The aim is to prevent those who're already Steeled Veterans owners - via in-game purchase or by upgrading to the Super Citizen Edition - accidentally buying the war bond again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-se/games/helldivers-2/latest-news-and-updates/?blog=JN9kex2X1qlKXB8&amp;article=BpwjMPDzY2rkga1&amp;slug=warbond-token-announcement">a post</a> from Arrowhead, the warbond token will replace the Steeled Veterans warbond in the Super Citizen Edition and the associated upgrade for the standard edition. The change comes into effect on August 26th 2025.</p>
<p>"We never want players to buy things twice and not get the value of what they paid for," the studio's social media and community manager Katherine Baskin wrote. I've no doubt that's true, but the bigger reason for the change is definitely to stop Arrowhead's support team from having to keep processing an endless supply of super credit refund requests from narked players who've ended up double warbonding.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Helldivers, we’ve been listening to our community and we’re here to let you know of an upcoming update to the HELLDIVERS 2 editions.</p><p>We’re introducing the Warbond Token! It&nbsp;will allow players who purchase the HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen Edition or HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen… <a href="https://t.co/3HxIRCeJ92">pic.twitter.com/3HxIRCeJ92</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1940384398966157800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>If you buy the updated Super Citizen Edition or Super Citizen Edition upgrade following this switch in August, you'll be given the Warbond Token when you next log into the game. To check it's there, hover over any warbonds you've not bought in the store and see if a "Claim Premium Warbond" button pops up. Arrowhead say there are no plans to sell tokens as standalone DLC at the moment.</p>
<p>So, there you go. No more accidentally ending up in a 2warbonds situation that leaves you 2furious, just because you were desperate to make sure you own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">every cape</a> in the cosmos.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-super-citizen-edition-is-being-updated-to-stop-folks-accidentally-buying-the-same-warbond-twice]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Microsoft yet to confirm anything</p>

            <p>Microsoft have cancelled Rare's wistful bucolic ramble <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at the company this month</a>, according to a report. Microsoft themselves have yet to comment, but the news wouldn't be unexpected given that Everwild has been in development for around a decade, including its prototype phase, yet remains something of a mystery.</p><!--more-->
<p>The story comes from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, who cite "people with knowledge of the project". The same sources claim that team members are likely to lose their jobs in the process.</p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-new-game-is-everwild-some-sort-of-fantasy-nature-y-thing">revealed back in 2019</a> as a verdant fantasy experience that seeks "new ways to play in a natural and magical world". It cast you as an "eternal" being communing with plants and animals by means of staff-wielding rites, and seemed devoid of video game staples like combat and progression.</p>
<p>Over the years we've been treated to more trailers and concept art, but Rare have never quite explained what players do in the game, possibly because they hadn't worked it out themselves. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">"restarted the project from scratch"</a> in 2021, according to rumours, following the departure of creative director Simon Woodroffe.</p>
<p>I myself liked the peacenik green-living stylings of Everwild's announcement trailer, and was intrigued rather than confused by Rare's elusiveness about tasks, goals and mechanics. Xbox boss wizard Phil Spencer was similarly positive when he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">talked about the game earlier this year</a>, commenting "we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have."</p>
<p>At the same time, Everwild has always felt like a hard sell within Microsoft, even given the relative success of the comparably playful and bloodshed-averse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>. Microsoft do not historically go in for this kind of hippy fairytale, to put it mildly. And when a game is in the works (in some form) for 10 years and still doesn't have a release date, a happy ending seems unlikely.</p>
<p>I'll mail Microsoft for comment. If you're employed at Rare, best of luck navigating all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports]]></content:encoded>
