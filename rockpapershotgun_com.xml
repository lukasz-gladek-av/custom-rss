            <p>
Imagine a second, alternate version of our world. Everything is the same, on the surface. The sky is blue, the economy is in shambles; it's the unnatural order of things. And yet, you cannot help but feel something is different. Like there's something missing, or perhaps replaced. Ah, there it is - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</a> is not a game that even remotely exists. As it turns out, this world, our world, where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 does, or rather will, exist, is only the world we exist in thanks to the flip of a coin.
</p>
<p>
This, I would like to be clear, is not a joke. "We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'" explained Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/we-ended-up-flipping-a-coin-slay-the-spire-devs-left-it-up-to-pure-chance-whether-theyd-make-a-sequel-or-something-else/">PC Gamer</a> in a recent interview. Apparently this was during Covid, and both Giovannetti and Casey Yano were looking for their next proper project.
</p>
<p>
According to Giovannetti, a Slay the Spire sequel wasn't the only idea they had. "We had different paths we could work on," he explained. "One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on it, and the rest is history."
</p>
<p>
The coin flip itself isn't something Giovannetti witnessed first hand, it was Yano that did it over a Discord call, which the former notes was "maybe questionable," but he still believes he was told "true result. I think Casey would've massively preferred the coin went the other way, because I was always the card game person, and he was the action game person."
</p><p>
There is nothing more joyful, to me, than seeing the creator of a thing engage in an exercise that is so directly tied to the kind of thing that they make. In this case, it is Mega Crit playing with that fickle game called chance, in the hopes that it will work out, that they will, if they're lucky enough, slay the spire. But maybe don't do this if you aren't literally the folks who made Slay the Spire, this isn't a point in history to be taking unnecessary risks.
</p>
<p>
Slay the Spire 2 is currently slated for release on a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-a-secret-thursday-in-march-2026-alternate-acts-teased">secret Thursday</a>" in March 2026, where you'll be able to play it in early access. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">here</a>.

            <p>
I can see it now… in the near future, the review embargo for Suda51's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, and as far as the eye can see the digital realm is scorched with 7/10s. Its maximalist shenanigans, techno-blasting soundtrack, and ridiculous premise puts it in a position where it couldn't possibly be for everyone, even if such a score is actually ideal for such a game, but when has that ever been the case for a Suda51 game? However, as I said, this vision I have is in the near future, because the hyper-violent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
This release date comes as part of an as always over-the-top new trailer, locking it for launching February 11, 2026 (as locked in as any game can be these days). There's a line in said trailer that I think perfectly encapsulates my feelings of everything I've seen of Romeo is a Dead Man so far, from the titular character himself: "Am I supposed to understand what you're talking about?" I pose this question in return to Grasshopper Manufacture, though to be honest I don't particularly need a response.

<p>
There's enough in the trailer that intrigues me enough to pull me towards that February release date; stylish as hell combat with so many particle effects you'll probably start to feel dizzy, bombastic special attacks that transport you to another dimension, a blank, empty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>-as-hell room, a zombie woman for some reason, an unexplained fusion between a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> and a Gundam, it has it all and more.
</p><p>
It's entirely possible that this all ends up being style over substance, the substance in question being the combat more than the story, I don't need the story in a game like this to sing the highest of emotional peaks. I need it to commit to its outlandishness, and deliver on its crunchy melee swings and punchy gunshots. I'll find out if it manages to do that in a couple of months!

            <p>Waking up at the crack of dawn today, I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices did not have a comments thread in which to badger us to play Troubleshooter Colon Abandoned Children. I burst from the covers, ran weeping to my PC (this happens most mornings, to be fair) and discovered that I had forgotten to finish the intro for our latest What Are We All Playing This Weekend article. And now I have. So, what are you all playing this weekend?</p><!--more-->
<p><strong>Jeremy</strong><br>I've come down with a bit of a cold, so it's highly likely that this weekend will mostly be spent in bed trying to recover from the whirlwind of house repairs and other chaos that has dominated life since October. I shall resume my hunts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy XII</a> and let the auto-battling Gambit system take over for me, most likely. Go on, my brave Ivalice squad - kill some things while I shuffle your macros from behind the scenes in order to alleviate the aches in my bones!</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>This is like turning up to a biker bar and loudly announcing you’ve bought a vintage Volvo, but I picked up an old PS3 on eBay this week purely so I could play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns Of The Patriots. I’m sorry, PC brethren. I’m one of you, I promise! But I’ve given up hope they’re ever freeing this game from its PS3 prison, and paid my way to spending the weekend hiding in cardboard boxes and doing cool spy shit. Well, I’ll do that for 10 minutes before Kojima wrestles me down and forces me to watch my fifth subsequent feature-length movie masquerading as a cutscene.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong><br>Right, so Raceroom has just gotten a new car pack featuring the Mercs, Audis and Opels of the 2002 DTM series. As you might have read in the RPS 100, I love me some German touring cars, so you’ll probably find me blasting around Hockenheim or the Norisring in a pitched battle with Bernd Schneider, Laurent Aiello or Manuel Reuter this weekend.</p><p><strong>Ollie:</strong><br>It's been a rough time for me recently. My anxiety has been hitting me so hard that I feel like half a person. So this weekend, I'll be splitting my time between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a>, and a couple of hours stroking some of my favourite cats in the nearby cat cafe. And all three of those activities will be shared with some of my favourite people in the world. Hopefully together it can help soothe my frayed nerves.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong><br>I continue to enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-hours-of-tweaker-gunslinging-and-trench-warfare-im-sold-on-darktides-imminent-hive-scum-update">Hive Scumming</a> around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. Myself and a couple of friends have formed a shouty little triumvirate of mohawked wrong'uns, each specialising in one of the three pillars of grimdark hoodlum combat doctrine: guns, knives, and methamphetamine.</p>
<p><strong>Julian</strong><br>After a week of working perhaps too many 7am - 11pm days, I'm relaxing by going to an 11pm - 7am Wong Kar Wai marathon. As such, I have no plans to play games this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin</strong><br>I'm spending time with my partner this weekend, then I'm off for three days helping my dad with a house move. I might find some time for a go at Total Chaos, the new horror game from the Turbo Overkill developer. Although I've played a lot of horror games recently. Maybe I'll read a book? Maybe I'll read some books recommended by a game developer, even?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...</em>
