You might be currently wondering where the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is, seeing as it hasn't turned up yet, and to explain its absence developer Arrowhead have taken to the game's Witter account with a post going into some details about it. Apparently it was originally planned for Tuesday, i.e. yesterday, October 21st, but a "last-minute certification issue caused a delay."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the studio is currently aiming for a release by the end of the week, with "staff ready to work over the weekend if needed." On that point, hope you pay good overtime and will give said staff members time off in kind, Arrowhead! However, you also shouldn't hold them to it, as they also say there's a chance the issue won't be fixed by this Friday, meaning the patch could be delayed even further into next week. "We’re doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding," explains Arrowhead.

The post goes on to note how Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">pushed back things like Warbonds</a> to focus fixing up performance, and outlined some of the optimisations coming to the game whenever the next patch launches. This includes things like optimised status effects, physics, asset distribution and setup, VFX, and AI behaviours. 
</p>
<p>
There should also be reduced stuttering during the drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds, improved audio IO performance and general performance. Generally sounds like it'll be a good patch for smoothing over some of its current snaggly bits. You just have to wait a bit longer for it!
