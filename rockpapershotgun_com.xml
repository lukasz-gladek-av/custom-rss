            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is in a bit of a Schrödinger's cat situation. That's because at the time of writing, the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">official site</a> only shows the shooter's logo, and text that reads "This site is currently unavailable. Please contact support@codethirtytwo.com for assistance," alongside links to its official Discord server and Dwitter page. This, of course, could just be a blip, but even as I'm writing this it's been the case for several hours, and there's not a single word from developer Wildlight about why it's down. So, it is both dead and not dead until someone opens the box.
</p>
<p>
This obviously isn't an immediate confirmation that the game is shutting down, but given that last week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">most of the team was apparently laid off</a>, there is certainly reason to question whether this is that famed writing on the wall you so often hear about. The silence from Wildlight in both the game's Discord server and social pages certainly adds to the writing.
</p>
<p>
Parallel to all of this, a report has emerged from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment">Game File</a> that sheds a tidbit of light on how Highguard came to be. Namely, that the game was predominantly funded by Tencent. It's been unknown up to this point just who funded the game, given Wildlight's proud proclamation of independence.
</p>
<p>
The framing of Wildlight as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">indie studio</a> by founder Dusty Welch has been a sticking point for me since the moment I heard it, seeing as prior to the layoffs it was a 100+ person company. To hear a report that Wildlight were funded by a company as massive as Tencent doesn't offer me any sense of vindication, more frustration at the hubris at those at the top to think they can just repeat the success they previously had many years of changing industry trends later.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, here's hoping that those affected by the layoffs end up on their feet, and much the same to those who may or may not be out of work by the end of the week.

"Huh." This, as admiringly as I can make this sound, was the first thought I thunked when I put down the demo for Titanium Court. Here is a game that is many things. The first thing it is is a play, in perhaps a literal sense, perhaps as a tool to immediately allow one to suspend their sense of disbelief at everything that is about to follow. We're watching a play, a narrative vehicle where anything can happen as long as what's on stage is convincing enough to make us believe it's happening. And truthfully, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what did happen.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, the genre descriptors, let's establish those. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, sure. Then it's also a match three game, which is where the wheels are forced to start turning. You find yourself at the center of the Titanium Court, a single tile on a field of many. There are mountains, forests, rivers, and other courts (evil, nasty courts filled with Them) who want to kill you. Not during the match three portion, however, during that section you match until you run out of moves, gathering up resources to then use to send out farmers to collect more resources, or soldiers to destroy Them and their courts, as a timer runs down until you either win or die trying.

These are the mechanics as they were presented to me, and they're all very neat and tidy. It's the thing that surrounds the mechanics, the surreal, almost Hylicsian quality to the story. By Hylicsian I mean that the world does not do you the kindness of explaining itself. There is a tutorialisation of the gameplay, sure, but the characters, including the likes of a very hungry cat and a man who can only answer questions you haven't asked, do not act as emitters of exposition. You must take what you are given, and figure out what to do with it.
</p><p>
There's very much an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alice-in-wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> quality to it all as well, a feeling of characters talking at you, putting you, or I suppose the nameless woman (an understudy in the play) in the role of queen, adding on all the expectations that comes with it. Undoutably it would be remiss of me to not frame it as at least somewhat Lynchian, though in a direction entirely of its own making. It is a game you can only describe as odd, or alluring, or maybe they're one in the same! Either way, I'm tickled pink by it, so I've thrown it on the ole wishlist, and you can do so too right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/">here</a> (and check out its demo too!).
