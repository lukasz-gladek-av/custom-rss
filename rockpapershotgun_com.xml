Anyone up for a little shindig? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> clearly are, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>' second season is all about the Hellfire Gala, a fun little party gone wrong hosted by Emma Frost. As you'll no doubt be aware, Emma Frost isn't in the game currently, making her the first of the new characters to join this season, which kicks off next week, April 11th. 
</p>

<p>
The Hellfire Gala is actually a story from the comics, set on Krakoa, a living island where mutants live, with the whole gimmick of this season being that everyone and anyone is invited for a big ole party.

That gets rudely interrupted by the second new character of the season (who'll be coming a bit later), Ultron, who crashes the party by saying that man and mutant "will be exterminated." Here's the thing I can't get over though: he really sounds like a bloody Dalek. That choice to have him say "exterminated" can't be a coincidence, right? He just sounds like a Dalek that's trying to deepen its voice so that it sounds a bit tougher. Not quite the sultry tones of the likes of James Spader.
</p>
<p>
You can also spot a number of characters in new costumes you'll inevitably spend way too much money on, like Wolverine in a white tux, Storm with some vividly blue hair, Magneto cosplaying as a Space Marine, amongst a few other mutant and non-mutant characters.
</p>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/LOuv0tO_aLI?si=_lYN36-L8wO5KKcp">new Dev Vision</a> was shared today too, offering some more details on what lies ahead for the game. For one, from season 3 onwards, a new hero will debut every month, which just sounds like overkill if you ask me. There's also mission adjustments coming, new colour options for popular costumes, the ability to gift costumes to friends, new team-ups, and a bunch of adjustments. You can check out the video for specifics!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Alright folks, quiz time: what's the single best feature in the GTA series? I'll give you a second. Got your answer done? If you wrote anything but the in-game radio, you'd be dead wrong, obviously it's listening to boppin' tunes as you crash into lamp posts for the umpteenth time, there's nothing else it could be. I love an in-game radio, and as it turns out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> of all games will include one (didn't know they had radio on Arrakis).
</p>

<p>
Best of all though is the fact that the in-game radio will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546731472820633915">actually feature music from the original Dune games</a>, the pair of games released in 1992, Dune and Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis. I'd also like to highlight that the soundtrack for the first one even has its own name, Dune: Spice Opera, which is just lovely. It even received a remaster last year apparently, so you'll have some crispy tunes to enjoy as you travel the desert planet (sadly, co-composer St√©phane Picq passed away just this February).

There's apparently three channels to peruse on the Communinent as it's been dubbed, like Harvester Radio, a station catered to the "commoner workforce." This one will be where you'll be able to listen to music, but also get some tips for survival and even ads, apparently. They're everywhere these days! There's also official Harkonnen and Atreides channels, though maybe stay away if you're susceptible to propaganda.
</p>
<p>
The in-game radio is fun, but including music from the original Dune games is just such a lovely touch. Most people obviously think of the newer films, the OG David Lynch version, and of course the books themselves, so it's a cute way of acknowledging another aspect of the sci-fi series' history. I'm not big on MMOs generally, but this might be enough to get me to give it a go at the very least.
