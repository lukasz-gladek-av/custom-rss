            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developers Sandfall Interactive have wheeled out news that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'ll be getting a free update which'll include a new location for its party to explore, more boss battles, and some extra costumes. The studio are teasing that there'll be other stuff packed into this update, which they say is designed to act as a thank you to folks who've delved into the Belle Ã‰poque Frenchness.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche told our mates/mortal enemies over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Euro Truck Gamer 2</a>. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now." He added that this update is "not a super big DLC extension with hours of content", but will contain "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well", so set your expectations right in the middle.</p>
<p>The studio have <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive">confirmed some of the stuff that'll be in there</a>. "A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover," is the headliner, but some extra boss battles to challenge late game grinders are giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>The expeditioneers - no idea if they're ever called that in the game, but I'm rolling with it - will get some new clothes to rock. Text and interface localisation in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian is also incoming. Sandfall have teased that there'll be more things, but they're not revwheeling those things yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Nic had some words about Clair Obscur when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">reviewed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Very occasionally, I'll play an RPG that makes me feel ten again. Rebirth. Cris Tales. Revisiting Suikoden. Years come, the big number ticks down, and comfortable appreciation replaces the spellbound enchantment of being told a story, of being swept off to a new world. Of playing Final Fantasy 8 in that special edition shirt that Ben Starr likes to wear that I wish I'd kept because I bet it's worth a bloody fortune now. You wait for a game to bring you back there, mostly certain you've moved passed the capacity to feel that way because you now have the sort of adult concerns that cause you ask how much a shirt might be worth on Ebay. I can't say if Clair Obscur will work its magic on everyone the same way, but it certainly did for me. I'm still not ready to leave, honestly. What a special and rare thing this is: a story that feels like someone wanted to tell it so badly it hurt.</blockquote>
<p>Come on dude, stop sitting on the fence and give us some indication of how you feel.</p>
<p>This free Clair Obscur update's got no release date or estimate attached yet, so it'll definitely arrive after Nic achieves the power to reach through my screen, grab me by the collar, and tell me he thought the game was the term above good.</p>

            <p>Paradox have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s All Under Heaven DLC, the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s "largest expansion" ever, which extends its dynastic soap opera to medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia. The map expansion is coming on 28th October. It's the first time the series has ventured to these latitudes, which seem a little incompatible with the European crusader premise. It also introduces Japanese language support.

<p>In a disgraceful betrayal of Rock Paper Shotgun's fine editorial traditions, I have yet to complete a single game of Crusader Kings 3. Every time I feel like trying, somebody says something like "oh great, let us know when your spymaster has an affair with himself", and I retreat frowning into the bushes. Still, I do like the sound of an expansion that encompasses the river valleys of China, Mount Fuji, and the Great Wall.
</p>
<p>"Keep a steady hand on the regional hegemon or manage the tumult of dynastic change in China," Paradox's emissary explained to us, before I had him thrown in an iron maiden. "Revere the Yamato emperor and his regent in Japan, or pursue the path of the samurai warlord. Build a monumental temple facility in the jungles of Southeast Asia and compel weaker kingdoms to pay tribute to your greatness."
</p>

<p>There's more in the press release from game director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia," he comments, rudely undermining my observation up the page about this being an unlikely staging ground for a kingly crusade. Watch your tone, Alexander. We always have an iron maiden going spare.
</p>
<p>Let's all celebrate these fulsome tidings in the traditional medieval style, with a banquet of freshly laid and hard-boiled bulletpoints, covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>China: The Mandate of Heaven</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ascend to the highest tier of power with the new Hegemony title, reigning supreme over all empires in the Chinese region.</li>
<li>Navigate the Dynastic Cycle, a living system of stability and chaos. Exploit periods of instability to rise to power and reshape the political landscape.</li>
<li>Explore the Celestial government system, unique to China. Earn Merit through deeds or the Imperial Examinations, gaining favor and influence.</li>
<li>Manage the Imperial Treasury to fund Great Projects, defend against disasters, or expand your influence with statecraft and might.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Japan: Rise of the Shogunate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Take control of a Japanese house and forge your destiny. Rise through the intricate courtly system to become a mighty Shogun or Kampaku regent.</li>
<li>Strengthen your position through alliances, intrigue, and ritual, or unite the houses through the strength of your samurai armies; which path you take is for you to decide.</li>
<li>Lead the Imperial Yamato house to restore power to the Emperor, ushering in an age of imperial grandeur.</li>
<li>Experience the rich cultural traditions of Japan, where honor and scandal intertwine, shaping the lives of lords and vassals alike.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Southeast Asia: God-Kings and Temple Empires</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rule as a Devaraja with the Mandala Government, uniting tributaries into vast, temple-centered empires.</li>
<li>Pay tribute to the God King by performing Tributary Missions as a Tributary ruler, increasing favor with your subjects.</li>
<li>Explore the Silk Road, new Starting Bookmarks and Historical Flavor</li>
<li>Thrive along the expansive Silk Road by profiting from the wealth and innovations of China, even if you are far beyond its borders.</li>
<li>New historical starting bookmarks bring fresh perspectives and new challenges. Play as iconic characters from the past or forge your unique path.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in Asia's cultural, artistic, and historical nuances with new throne rooms, events, and traditions.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The price tag is just as hefty as the expansion itself - $29.99, Â£24.99 or â‚¬29.99. Alternatively, you can get it in the Crusader Kings III: Chapter IV expansion pass. I'm not sure I'd pay Â£24.99 for the Great Wall - I hear it was more effective as a psychological deterrent than a literal obstacle. Still, you do you. While you're sizing up the price tag vs the feature sheet, let us know if you've had any more trouble with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-update-1171-brings-a-heap-more-fixes-for-the-coronations-dlcs-misbehaving-oaths">misbehaving oaths</a>.</p>

            <p>Amid continued concerns about Steam and Itch's changing of their approach to adult games earlier this year, the UK government have stated they've got "no plans to intervene" in the decisions of payment processors who opt to withdraw support over certain content.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Valve</a> changed their rules regarding adult content in games a few months ago. That prompted a number of delistings and takedowns, as well as concerns about censorship. The storefronts pointed to pressure from credit card companies who process their purchases, with Australian protest group Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">taking credit</a> for nudging those payment processors into action.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response, <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/">counter-campaigners</a> have been making various efforts to push for a reverse in course, by mass calling companies like Visa and Mastercard, as well as petitioning governments to intervene. Enter a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734441">petition to the UK government</a> urging politicians to "ban payment processors stopping services based on objections to legal content", which has just gotten a response.</p>
<p>"Decisions regarding which businesses payment processors contract with are a commercial matter, taking into account the relevant requirements on the firm," reads the UK treasury statement in question.

</span></p><p>It's not a hugely surprising outcome, especially given this petition follows <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903">another one</a> which currently has over 540,000 signatures and attempts to convince the government to repeal the Online Safety Act, which came into force in the UK earlier this year and requires adult media sites to use age verification. That petition also received a firm no.</p><p>This latest appeal, which has so far amassed 12,355 signees, cited "reports that payment processing companies have recently placed pressure on companies that rely on their services, pressuring them to remove legitimate content" and called for payment processors to be made to "remunerate platforms and individuals for lost income until service is restored".</p>
<p>From my perspective, I'd say the wording opted for might have made the petition easier to dismiss, since it doesn't specify the legal adult games that are allegedly being targeted. To be clear, that's solely based on the view that it'd potentially be easier for politicians to wave away the petition or plead ignorance of its context if the question's more vague, assuming they're also likely predisposed not to want to be seen to mess with business/the processors unless presented with an undeniable reason for doing so. That said, it's impossible to tell from the page whether those who submitted the petition have or were given the chance to offer specific examples that could fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>If you want a much more thorough rundown of both the role payment processors play in defining or influencing definitions of what's permissible in terms of adult content, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">Edwin's full report on the subject</a>. In that report, former Stripe software engineer and acadmic Dr David L. Stearns said that he does believe it's possible the pushback from game developers could result in governments opting to amend or clarify laws or regulations, but this would likely require "significant leverage" in the form of pressure from voters or lobbyists.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is game storefronts seeking out alternative payment processors for adult content, something Itch.io have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">previously indicated they're looking into</a>, but that one isn't a guaranteed win, either.</p>
