            <p>EEK3 is the alternative showcase of small horror game creators that amalgamates every year like a shell of flies around the corpse of E3. It's a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. "The curse," say the organisers, "is lifted." </p>

<p>There are over 70 games shown off. As you can imagine, it's quite a long show. But I heard you have lots of time on your hands. It's a whole new year. And if you need it, here's <a href="https://www.moyahorror.com/eek3-games-list">a full list of all the games</a> on show. </p>

<p>There are more than a few stand-outs among the lo-fi horror. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-of-husks">Prison Of Husks</a> is a sword swinger set in a medieval castleland reminiscent of Lordran from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/angeline-era">Angeline Era</a> is a colourful and bumpy hack 'n' slash from the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> RPGs. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/of-love-and-eternity">Of Love And Eternity</a> is an attractively pixelated knightly romance - and by romance I mean your love was killed and so were you and now you are in a hellish skull-filled country where you have to use a lantern full of glowbugs to see the bone-littered path in front of you. We last saw it demoed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-love-and-eternity-is-a-scary-walk-with-good-noises">back in 2021</a>.</p><p>There are probably a ton of other promising entries - I haven't got through the whole show yet. But I spy some familiar faces coming down the gore tubes. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trip">Trip</a> is the funny, bright timeloop caper<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trip-is-a-pleasant-train-journey-with-normal-folk-like-this-unblinking-child-who-speaks-only-in-dark-symbols"> I tried in autumn</a>. And the grasping hand of non-euclidean horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eclipsium">Eclipsium</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-worth-downloading-the-demo-for-uncanny-horror-eclipsium-just-to-stare-at-your-hands">got Nic cooing</a>. And, oh look, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> also gets a shout-out, despite the fact the hot pink horror with horny demons already released in November (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-were-closed-review">Ed reviewed it</a>, in case you're wondering). This is probably just a hangover result of the showcase's long delay. </p>
<p>Still, yes, 70 games. That's a lot of ground to cover. Thankfully, the Haunted PS1 demo disc which accompanies the showcase is not quite so overwhelming. It only has 24 demos to try out. These demo discs have often been the delightfully fetid source of quiet hits. Parkour rock climbing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> was first featured on the demo disc back in 2021, for example. And one of my favourite games of last year, the Elder Scrolls-inspired <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, first appeared on the 2020 disc.</p>
<p>In short, the Haunted PS1 folks have a good track record for curating interesting stuff, and every disc has a fun framing device that makes it a game in itself. This year, a ritual has wrong, say the creators, and it has manifested a two-sided disc, with one side devoted to fearsome freakery and the other devoted to cute nostalgia. You can <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demo-disc-flipside-frights">download the demo disc on Itch</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've always wished there was a game workers equivalent of gobbing in an especially rude customer's cheeseburger. Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html">new policy</a> outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are instances where certain customers take actions directly or through our support centers, or towards our group executives, employees, partners who are involved in the creation and distribution of our group products and services, that constitute ‘customer harassment," reads the statement as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-square-enix-policy-aims-to-protect-employees-from-toxic-fans/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "such as denial of personality, violence, defamation, intimidation, advance notice of wrongdoing, advance notice of obstruction of business, harassment."</p>
<p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security," they continue, "but also causes disruptions to other customers. Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary". The action in question being to "cease providing support services or to refrain from providing our group’s products and services.”</p>
<p>Here's their list of absolutely Gaialess behaviour in full:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Harassment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Act of violence, violent behavior</li>
<li>Abusive language, intimidation, coercion, duress, excessive pursuit or reprimand</li>
<li>Defamation/slander, denial of personality, personal attack (including email, contact in contact form, comment or post on the internet), advance notice of wrongdoing, advance notice of obstruction of business</li>
<li>Persistent inquiries, repeated visits</li>
<li>Trespassing by visiting or staying in an office or related facility without permission</li>
<li>Unlawful restraint including via telephone calls and online inquiries</li>
<li>Discriminatory speech and conduct regarding race, ethnicity, religion, family origin, occupation, etc.</li>
<li>Infringement of privacy by taking pictures or making video recordings without consent</li>
<li>Sexual harassment, stalking, repeated stalking behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Undue demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Unreasonable changes or exchange of product or request for monetary compensation</li>
<li>Unreasonable response or request for an apology (including face-to-face response or request for an apology specifying the position of our employee or partners)</li>
<li>Excessive requests for the provision of products and services exceeding socially accepted norms</li>
<li>Unreasonable and excessive demands for punishment of our employees</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As VGC highlight, Briana White has previously <a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1869877671628607729">spoken out online</a> to request that "shippers" please relax. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> features a love triangle between her character Aerith, protagonist Cloud, and his childhood friend Tifa - a secondary story element that a certain subset of the audience have historically taken far too seriously, which has apparently spilled over into real-life harassment of White.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I imagine the bulk of this is mostly the kind of boilerplate you find in policies about harassment, rather than responses to any specific incident. Although the line "unreasonable changes or exchange of product or request for monetary compensation" requires a bit of good faith that Square Enix's idea of "unreasonable" is in line with everyone else's.</p><p>Again, though, it seems mostly like covering bases to me. I imagine the "unreasonable and excessive demands for punishment of our employees" line rings depressingly true to anyone who's ever seen the sheer catastrophic levels of entitlement floating around on social media from people who feel that buying one (1) videogame gives them the right to attempt to purge workers they disagree with. Love to be a human on the internet in 2025. Love it.</p>
