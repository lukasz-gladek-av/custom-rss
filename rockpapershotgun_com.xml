Eremite Studios and Hooded Horse’s bestest best city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a> is getting a free update and a new paid expansion, featuring a new biome, mechanics and faction. Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

            <p>FromSoftware boss and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">treacherous moon denier</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki has emerged from his Nintendo-nuzzling weasel den to reassure the braying masses that FromSoftware's traditional focus on single player games isn't going dodo just because they so happened to announce two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods - in the space of five minutes, then ran away with a bag of money shouting "single player is dead 4eva". What a tremendous relief.</p>

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
City-building can be an exhausting affair, once you’ve evolved beyond the initial joy of cottage windows lighting up at night, and start having to deal with things like traffic congestion and rubbish collectors going on strike. As such, it’s nice to play a city builder in which you can rest easy in the knowledge that any urban sprawl you engineer will soon be obliterated. It’s even nicer that said city builder is free.

<a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/before-the-ash">Before The Ash</a> is a hexagonal browser-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim created for the Godot Wild Jam 79 by Aviv Levy. Said game jam’s theme is “growing”. Another developer might have read the entry requirements and knocked out a game about watering daffodils or inflating kittens, but Levy’s thoughts gravitated instead to one of the most famous natural disasters in history. The city you are building in Before The Ash is Pompeii, the Roman burg that was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
</p>
<p>
Vesuvius is kind of your co-mayor in Before The Ash. It periodically spews flaming boulders that set terrain tiles alight, with blazes spreading until they encounter water. You can extinguish these with your mouse cursor to extract Faith from your populace, which is spent to acquire building cards. The deployment of said building cards, meanwhile, requires resources generated by existing buildings, such as stone and food.</p>
<p>The flaming boulders may also double as a means of clearing away structures you’d like to replace. After a few minutes of this, you'll wonder how you ever managed without a neighbouring volcano. Still, there’s only so long you can cosy up to ole Mister Vesuv. It’ll eventually blow its top and annihilate the map. Your job is to rack up the highest score possible before it does. 
</p>
<p>
If <em>I</em> were Pompeii’s ruler, and I had clear evidence of impending apocalypse, I would probably think about organising evacuations before I started making plans for new aqueducts. Still, I can’t deny that I enjoy the concept of collaborating with a volcano to tidy away some offensive fishing huts and gentrify the riverside. I’d love the developer to flesh out this idea some more.
