            <p>After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and its sequels are "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game", according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">a report by Bloomberg</a>. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The revelation is buried in a deeper report about the goings-on at publisher Warner Bros. Last month the company announced that head honcho David Haddad would be stepping down after 12 years in charge of the video games division. A resignation that seems like a head rolling for the bad business year Warner Bros had in 2024.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">reportedly lost  $200 million</a> (about £156 million) on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> after it emerged from development hell as an "unambitious and old-fashioned" looter shooter. Or so said Steve Hogarty when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">reviewed it</a> for us.</p>
<p>"There’s a really excellent single-player action game hiding somewhere deep inside Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League," our Steve wrote, "calling out for help from beneath a few metric tonnes of loot-addled drudgery."</p>
<p>Now that excellent single player action game might actually break back out. If Rocksteady can manage to shake the sore history of upsets that have dogged the studio since the last entry in the Batman Arkham series. There were allegations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-arkham-devs-rocksteady-accused-of-failing-to-address-sexual-harrassment">sexual harassment</a>, for instance, which the studio argued were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-say-they-have-dealt-with-the-issues-raised-by-reports-of-sexual-harrassment">eventually addressed</a>. Suicide Squad was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-delayed-to-spring-2023">delayed</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-officially-delayed-until-2024">delayed again</a>. When it finally released it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-devs-say-login-and-server-issues-are-not-an-easy-nut-to-crack">had server issues</a> and owners of the "Deluxe edition" had the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-gift-early-suicide-squad-players-in-game-cash-to-apologise-for-game-finishing-itself">weirdly complete itself for them</a>. Then came the layoffs, which our sister site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Eurogamer reported on in September 2024</a>, with another round of job cuts becoming clear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">last month</a>. None of this has likely been easy for workers at the studio.</p><p>It would be a nice redemptive arc if Rocksteady rose out of this mess with a new single player Batman game that put their historic strengths as a studio on display. That's what would happen in a Batman story anyway. For now, we'll keep our bat ears tuned for any rumbles about the rumoured game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">financial earnings</a>. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Zelnick repeated that Rockstar would launch the criminalistic third-person city wrecker for consoles "in the fall" and also confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>'s summer release, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s release sometime "before year end". </p>
<p>It's a bit weird to write a news story which is essentially: "nothing has changed". Especially since Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">already told us the same thing in November last year</a>. Back then Zelnick said he was "highly confident in the timing". I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. </p>
<p>I know! Let's think of this news story as, oh, an investment. If GTA 6 <em>is</em> delayed, we can make a post about the delay and then link back to these two news items, with a headline like "GTA 6 has been delayed even though Take-Two told everyone it wouldn't be... twice". So if you're seeing this article from the future in which that has happened: hello!</p><p>The call also includes the usual business boasts. GTA V has sold 210 million copies, says Zelnick. GTA Online has spanned three console generations. Take-Two have an "extraordinary corporate database" that tracks 1 billion records about their players. "We observe all privacy regulations, of course." adds Zelnick, cyberpunkily.   </p>
<p>Most of this he says after being asked broadly about sales expectations and whether younger people will buy the game, with some brief stakeholder lipbiting over "lapsed players".</p>
<p>"We're looking over our shoulder," says Zelnick, "our competitors are not asleep... Rockstar Games in particular seeks perfection in everything they do."</p>
<p>It'd be good if they could perfectly give me a PC release date. I'm needy and insecure too!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
