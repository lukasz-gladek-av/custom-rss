            <p>Resident Evil 9 - aka Resident Evil Requiem - is in development, there's a substantial trailer below, and most surprisingly, it already has a specific release date: February 27th, 2026.</p>

<p>Described as a change in tone for the series, the trailer shows an FBI agent being sent to investigate a series of unusual murders at a hotel. The agent in question is referred to as "Grace Ashcroft", presumably connecting her with journalist Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak. But that's just me speculating and I know little about Resi lore.
</p>
<p>We've heard distant groans of Resident Evil 9 in the past. Rumours of the horror sequel started circulating like a trendy virus after an online store <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows-pops-up-online-along-with-ps5-versions-of-code-veronica-zero-and-resi-5">advertised the sequel prematurely</a>, albeit with a placeholder store description. Later, the director of Resident Evil 7 confirmed that Capcom were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-resident-evil-game-confirmed-with-the-director-of-resi-7-at-the-helm">working on a new Resi game</a>, but wouldn't say exactly what it was at the time.</p>
<p>I can't believe I now need to learn how to consistently spell Requiem correctly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> has always been an 'almost' series for me. On paper, it's such a slam dunk of a concept it feels to hard to imagine it being anything other than brilliant. In practise, the games have always felt a bit thin and tedious, even while boasting some undeniably impressive dinos. Could the third time be the charm? We'll find out later this year, anyway. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> releases 21st October. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Much like the previous games, you'll be DNA splicing, hatching, and looking after dinosaurs, all while running a park that keeps your guests suitably uneaten enough to keep forking over cash. The big new addition here is baby variants of the 80 dino species, and there's also new campaign locations like Japan and Hawaii.</p>
<p>"Create jaw-dropping parks with new creative tools never before seen in the Jurassic World Evolution series!", exclaims the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>. "From groundbreaking terrain editing to modular scenery customisation â€“ build and tweak every aspect of your park from the ground up". Is that the same ground that just got broken? Feels unwise to lay down foundations there, have to say.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-2">Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> makes significant changes to the DNA of its predecessor," was Nate's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review">take on the last one</a>. "But ends up right back where it started: a magnificent feat of adaptation stretched over the bones of an inconsistent management game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
