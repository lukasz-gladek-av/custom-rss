            <p>After rapidly declaring that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">looking into action</a> the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have released a hotfix aiming to rectify some of the crashing that's affected players diving Into the Unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike the giant worms I've still seen hide nor mandible of, it didn't take the studio long to address reports of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">uptick in technical issues</a> for the shooter following the update's arrival on Tuesday. Here's hoping that these fixes'll help keep thing a bit more stable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516346126609155527?l=english">hotfix 01.004.001</a>, which has arrived just after the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516345493302804917?l=english">Dust Devils warbond</a>, are pretty short, so I'll aim to ward off my worst tendencies and keep it brief.</p>
<p>Fixes for crashes related to particle effects, post-reinforcement hellpodding, "if the target of a seeking missile gets deleted before impact", aborting missions while driving, or just fighting the automatons in general. All check. Issues with the update's new caves becoming "darker than intended" when on lower graphics settings and an opposing problem with hellpads emitting excessively bright light. Dealt with.
</p><p>The warp pack "getting stuck suspended in the air or crashing". Sorted. Erratic extraction shuttle landings. Rendered a lot safer. Also, the speargun's reload time's been dialled down and the Dust Devils gear's solo silo stratagem's immediately had its cooldown quickened by half a minute.</p>
<p>One fix that isn't in there is for freezing issues <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/1/591780546280097257/">some PC players have reported running into</a> since late August, with machines apparently becoming unresponsive to the point a manual button-press shutdown required. However, over on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1218153537914273802/1411297235425169409">Discord</a>, a player support agent with the handle Bvits has at least said they've "alerted the team that this is happening to some players, they're looking into it".</p>
<p>Right, there you go. Zippy. Succinct. Concise. No rambling here. If you want that, go read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">my impressions from a few hours of Terminid hive world missioning</a> on Tuesday evening.</p>

            <p>Roblox will roll out selfie-based "facial age estimation technology" as a mandatory requirement for all of its players, as part of efforts to "limit communications" between minors and adults they don't know.</p>
<p>The corporation behind the massive game filled with smaller games, many of which are made by young people, say they aim to bring in this measure by the end of 2025. The news is part of a "long-term" vision for child safety in the wake of the US state of Louisiana's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144">lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a>, with Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman wrote in <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">an announcement</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-to-begin-using-facial-age-estimation-technology-on-its-users-promises-to-limit-communication-between-adults-and-minors-unless-they-know-each-other-in-the-real-world/">PC Gamer</a> that this age estimation tech will be deployed to everyone who uses the game's built-in communications systems, and will work alongside the likes of ID age verification and parental consent to "provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account." On top of that, they promise "new systems" to limit minors' interactions with adult strangers.
</p>
<p>"Weâ€™re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not."</p><p>Roblox's facial age estimation works by "analysing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features", at which point the user's assigned to one of three groups, under 13, over 13, and over 18. The experience the game offers changes based on which bucket folks land in, and "certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox" for those flagged as under 13 years old.</p>
<p>So, it's a slightly more in-depth iteration of the photo-based age checks you may well have had to do as part of the measures many sites and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">services</a> have launched in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, with the likes of credit card and ID checks often being the alternatives. These checks haven't proven to be totally bulletproof (hello, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">Norman Reedus' Death Stranding mug</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the legal action from Louisiana, Roblox has also faced child safety criticism from politicians like <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition">Democrat Ro Khanna</a>. This isn't the first time the game has made headlines for mistreatment of children, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting game creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers also having been lobbied at it. </p>
<p>Those behind Roblox have annoucned other steps recently to protect kids who are hopping in for a bit of Grow a Garden. That's included <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">cracking down on "vigilantes"</a> who were impersonating minors in an alleged effort to catch adults behaving inappropriately, something the game's overseers argued was only confusing matters.</p>
