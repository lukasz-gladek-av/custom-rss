            <p>FranÃ§oise Cadol, the long-time French voice actor for Lara Croft, has reportedly launched legal action against <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> publishers Aspyr over alleged use of generative AI to replicate her voice for lines in the game. Cadol claims Aspyr didn't contact her to ask for permission, and it appears the voice of Croft in at least one other dub of the remasters may have been put in a similar position.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a report from French publication <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">Le Parisien</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-ai-voice-generation-france-francoise-cadol-cease-and-desist/">TheGamer</a>, Cadol has issued a cease and desist to Aspyr over the matter.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Aspyr for comment.</p>
<p>It looks like the alleged AI-generated lines may have been added to the game by <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-patch-2-notes">Patch 2</a> in mid-August. The notes for that patch include one that reads: "Restored missing or incorrect voiceover lines in various languages (especially Brazilian Portuguese)".</p><p>Cadol told Le Parisien she'd been alerted to the possible use of genAI to mimic her lines in the remaster by Tomb Raider fans, who've circulated what they believe to be examples of it happening on social media. Some of the lines supposedly using genAI in the remaster look to be tutorial instructions telling you how to do things like climb, with the comparison below featuring some different wording in the Remastered versions of some lines. The apparent genAI lines have a more robotic edge to them, in contrast to the natural inflections Cadol speaks with in the original.</p> <div>

<p>The French version isn't the only dub of the game to have allegedly done this. Lene Bastos, Croft's Brazilian Portuguese actor, has posted a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMNDrFj8R9/?hl=en-gb">video to Instagram</a> stating that Tomb Raider fans have informed her that some of voice lines appear to have been subject to AI generation in the remasters. Bastos claims to have recieved a message from Aspyr about it, with the publishers putting the blame at the feet of an external development partner and telling her the lines will soon be removed in the game's next patch.</p>
<p>Voice actors fighting for protections against the possibility of companies using generative AI to mimic their voices was a key element of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykx117keqo">SAG-AFTRA strike</a> that concluded a few months ago. "Basically you have to get our consent to make a digital replica of us," Horizon and Borderlands voice actor Ashly Burch told the BBC when the strike was suspended. "You have to tell us how you're going to use it, and then you have to compensate us fairly."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have yet again managed to pull off something remarkable. You know how creating patches to ensure two mods work together smoothly's long been something that requires firing up the likes of the creation kit or xEdit? Well, thanks to a new mod dubbed the in-game patcher, it's possible to resolve issues like that simply by wandering up to the location as the Dragonborn and editing the very make-up of the world.</p>
<p>See a rock clipping through a house because you've downloaded a couple of works that give the same bit of Whiterun a makeover? Just mosey over, grab the misbehaving mineral, and either move it elsewhere or delete it. You'll have make sure you've not messed up anything else in the process before you save your changes, but assuming all the NPCs still have their own heads, you've got your own patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder behind this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158681?tab=description">in-game patcher</a> is RavenKZP, whose previous projects include some equally advanced stuff. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101364">Adding seasons</a> to the new areas added to the RPG by the likes of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and a mechanic that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113658">makes food go mouldy</a> if you keep it in your pockets too long. They've also made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125890">a quest</a> involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s Uncle Sweetshare, which earns them a million extra points in my book.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of me curiously nerding out. This in-game patcher, originally spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-mod-conflict-fix-in-game-patche-nexus-mods/">TheGamer</a>, is a plugin for Skyrim: Special edition's script extender. Once it's installed, you enter and exit a patching mode by opening and closing the game's console, where you typically enter the likes of spawn commands.</p><p>Once open, you select objects as you usually would in the console, and can move, rotate, scale, or remove them as you see fit. Markers, such as spawn points and those which control the likes of idles, furniture interactions, and which way water flows can also be manipulated in the same fashion. You can also add keywords to items if you're so inclined. There are a bunch of quick YouTube tutorials under the mod page's video tab to help you get started.</p>

<p>RavenKZP wrote that their creation can also be used simply to rejig the world clutter to your liking or do a bit of redecorating of houses, cities and the like, which'll probably be what I try first if I give it a whirl. Once you've made your tweaks, they can be saved as "BOS/KID patches so they persist across game sessions" and shared with others in ini file form. The modder's also got plans to keep expanding what their work can do going forwards, including adding the ability to edit multiple objects at once.</p>
<p>As you might imagine given what it pulls off, the in-game patcher does come with a pretty chunky list of requirements - the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim script extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444">Address Library for SKSE Plugins</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123664">Object Manipulation Overhaul</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352">SKSE Menu Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148703">SkyPrompt</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805">Base Object Swapper</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456">Debug Menu</a>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13090">Jaxonz Positioner Converter Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250">More Informative Console</a> are optional extras.</p>

            <p>Gearbox and Take-Two Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched to cries of "pretty good" from (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">some</a>) professional reviewers, and "Stutterland bugfest" from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">a vocal portion of the Steam playerbase</a>. In amongst the complaints about performance, there are some fears about potential breaches of player privacy supposedly allowed for by Take-Two's terms of service. A Borderlands developer has now responded to these fears in the Steam forums, reiterating that Take-Two at large aren't in the business of "spyware".
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/">the statement on Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service.
</p>
<p>"Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations," it goes on. "Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience."</p>
<p>The statement gives a couple of examples of more innocuous data collection, such as sponging up player and device identifiers to ensure compatibility with platforms, or making usernames visible to other players, together with more ambiguous practices like gathering data "to better understand how players play games".</p><p>Take-Two have been caught deploying some pretty 
insalubrious data collection software in the past. As reported by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2018, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> once made use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-vi-removes-red-shell">Red Shell software</a> to track certain system data, in a bid to identify whether people who've clicked on adverts for games then proceed to buy them.
</p>
<p>The Steam statement also seeks to clarify Take-Two's policy towards mods, noting that they "prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to", but do not "generally" take action against mods "that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties." I'm not that familiar with the Borderlands modding scene, but Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somebody-recreated-all-of-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-gta-5-aaaaand-its-gone">have a legendarily iffy relationship with GTA modders</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">Perignon Champagne Gamer</a>, the concern about Take-Two spyware dates back at least to May this year, when a Youtuber video about <a href="https://www.take2games.com/privacy/en-US/">the publisher's recently revised TOS</a> sparked a short-lived uproar.</p>
<p>I do not want to hand over any of my data to any particular large corporation, myself, but I have to say, I don't see anything in that TOS that strikes me as out of the ordinary, for better and worse. Suspicion is the appropriate response to such things, but exaggeration helps nobody. I've read a few comments that assume that Take-Two are automatically hoovering up everything mentioned in the list of possible data types collected, the second you boot up a game, rather than when you deliberately opt into certain services, such as Borderlands 4's irritating SHiFT service for cross-play.</p><p>I am adding "interview somebody to do a proper explainer about data collection practices and privacy" to our endlessly extendable, usefully hypothetical Long Term Features trello. While we're at it, we could look into related anxieties about anti-cheat and DRM, which have recently resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call Of Duty and Battlefield requiring that you enable secure boot on PC</a>.</p>
<p>The TOS aside, some Borderlands 4 players are concerned about the game's usage of two types of digital rights management - the infamous Denuvo software, which has been cited by a few of the reviews that mention launch performance problems, with proprietary Symbiote software stacked on top. We interviewed a Denuvo executive last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-respond-to-their-rep-for-tanking-games-im-a-gamer-myself-and-therefore-i-know-what-im-talking-about">about their reputation for tanking games</a>.

<p><em>This article has been updated to mention Civilization 6's use of Red Shell tracking software.</em></p>
