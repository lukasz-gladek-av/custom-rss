            <p>It's been over half a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-next-patch-come-with-first-bits-dlc-team-folon-celebrates-becoming-registered-business">announced that it'd be getting three bits of DLC</a> adding new quests to post-apocalyptic Blighty. The folks behind the massive mod have been relatively quiet in that time, but they've now confirmed that the first of these DLCs, Rabbit and Pork, will require you to start a fresh save game.</p>
<p>Also, one reason it hasn't arrived already is that the team have been working to ensure other quest add-ons won't force you to go back to square one, whenever they drop.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC is a DLC in name only really, it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content," Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter wrote on Team FOLON's<a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1233281020376252417/1421047996292005960">Discord server</a> over the weekend, in response to a user asking if they'd have to start over again when the DLC arrives. "So, it'll require a new save. One of the reasons it's also [taken] so long was ensuring any future groundwork for other quests in other DLCs won't require the new game save."</p>
<p>A fresh save being mandatory for at least the first of the three Fallout: London DLCs isn't a huge surprise. Since the mod first started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">updates and patches to fix bugs</a> last year, Team FOLON's advice for the best experience has been to start a new game each time a new version arrives, with carrying on from an established one being doable, but potentially leading you to run into "compatibility issues".</p><p>The possibility of messing with saves was what led the modders to roll Fallout: London's bug-fixing version 1.03 patch, originally teased late last year, into this upcoming first DLC. Given that, it's really encouraging to hear the modders have been working on ways to minimise the impact future updates'll have in this regard, since starting over in such a huge game every time it gets updated is far from ideal.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from this first DLC, Rabbit and Pork, Team FOLON's 2D art lead Emily ‘Saffron-rice’ Kemp wrote in a Discord exchange with another fan immediately following Carter's that DLC number one will include "various new side quests of different sizes, but no main quest content".</p>
<p>We do know that extra main questing will be coming in Fallout: London's third DLC, Wildcard, which looks to be the final one the modders have planned at the moment. As Carter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">revealed in an interview with me for my old home</a> last year, that DLC'll add in a whole New Vegas-style wild card arc for the game's main quest, which'll let you decide the fate of London without having to side with the three established main quest factions: Angel, Camelot, and the Fifth Column. This questline was originally intended to be in the base game, but had to be cut after the modder taking the lead on it was, in Carter's words, "basically forcibly conscripted" into the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>That leaves the second DLC, Last Orders, which very much looks pub-themed based on its name and the accompanying art. I'll be keen to give each of them a go, and all the better if I can get away without starting fresh three or four times in the process.</p>

            <p>Battlefield, EA Sports FC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> publishers Electronic Arts are holding "advanced talks" to go private with a valuation of $50 billion after 35 years as a public company, according to reports this weekend.
</p>
<p>If rumour breathe true, the buyers are a group of investors that include private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Affinity Partners, the Saudi-backed investment firm founded by Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The report comes via the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, the latter of whom cite "sources familiar with the matter". They claim that if the deal goes through, it could happen this week.
</p>
<p><em>If</em> the deal does happen, it will mean that BioWare, Criterion Games, DICE, Motive Studio, and Respawn Entertainment are now partly overseen by the investment arm of a state that oppresses women and queer people, executes journalists and imprisons political dissenters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> developers may find the prospect especially unwelcome, given the focus their games place on diverse casts.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Reuters frame the investments as part of Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030" strategy to diversify the Kingdom's heavily oil-reliant economy. The PIF were rumoured to be discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">a $2 billion investment deal</a> via their subsidiary Savvy Games with the infamously acquisition-happy Embracer Group some years ago. These talks reportedly fell through in May 2023, triggering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">a brutal period of mass layoffs and cancellations</a>. 
</p>
<p>More recently, the PIF acquired Scopely, US publishers of licensed games like Marvel Strike Force and the current developers of Pokemon Go. They have also funded the creation of a new Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in the historic city of AlUla, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">prompting internal criticism from Ubisoft developers</a>.
</p><p>In addition to investing in games publishers, the PIF have poured a lot of money into esports, acquiring companies and hosting tournaments in what has been widely styled a case of 'sportswashing' <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">the Kingdom's abysmal human rights record</a>. Earlier this month, the Public Investment Fund-backed company Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">became co-owner of fighting game tournament Evo</a>. Savvy Games already own ESL FACEIT Group, a merger of two esports organisers, who are organising next year's much-trumpeted Esports World Cup in Riyadh.
</p>
<p>As for the other two investment groups who are allegedly party to the EA deal, Silver Lake are a 1999-founded firm who once owned Skype, and who have also sunk a few doubloons into game engine company Unity and PC manufacturer Dell. Affinity Partners were founded by Kushner in 2021, and have received billions from the PIF, with Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman personally intervening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">push the investment through</a>. Kushner is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kushner-has-discussed-us-saudi-diplomacy-with-saudi-crown-prince-2024-10-04/">the subject of scrutiny</a> as to whether his Saudi partnerships have influenced his work in the US government.</p>
<p>The rumoured EA buyout would continue the past decade's consolidation of game developers and publishers in the hands of a select few megacorporations. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">completed their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year</a>, adding Call of Duty, Diablo and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> to the Xbox haggis. The world's largest videogame publisher, Tencent, have scooped up big outfits like Riot Games, Sumo Group and Funcom, while acquiring majority stakes or sizeable minority shares in the likes of Epic, Krafton and Paradox Interactive. Tencent recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funnelled a huge reservoir of money into Ubisoft</a> as part of the latter's wider corporate restructuring to focus on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six.
</p>
<p>EA have <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ea-sports-apex-legends-sales-electronic-arts-earnings-1236473474/">seen "better-than-expected" revenue growth</a> lately, but they've had some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">significant disappointments</a> in the past year or two, and are currently betting rather a lot on Battlefield 6, with executives allegedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">hell-bent on attracting 100 million players</a>. Whatever their current fortunes, it seems plausible that layoffs will follow any buyout, as the new overlords seek to 'optimise' their investment.
</p>
<p>I'll wire EA a request for comment.</p>

            <p>As has been the case with all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s sizeable updates this far, Team Cherry have put out some tweaks as a Steam beta shot to the upcoming patch three's chaser.

<p>That brings us to this weekend just gone, and a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/596286923597002888/">fresh Steam post</a> from devs Team Cherry. "While work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>'s third patch continues, an interim update is now live on the public-beta branch," they wrote. "This includes a few fixes that players may want to access, including some additional controller support and improvements."</p>
<p>In terms of controllers, the studio have added in support for PlayStation's dualsense edge stick-and-button doodads, generally improved how well controllers work on Mac, and made sure the game'll now automatically pause if your controller disconnects. That last one's good news if you happen, for reasons definitely not related to a boss narrowly besting you, to lob your bit of game-playing plastic across a room. Or out of a window.</p><p>Team Cherry have also enacted some "smaller" controller tweaks they don't deem worth dedicating in excess of one bullet point to, but have confirmed that more of those will be coming in the future. As for the rest of the tweaks currently in this beta update, they're as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that's it for now, Team Cherry did add that folks can "expect further additions prior to this one going live". So, if there's a fix or tweak you're desperate for and don't see here, there's still very much a chance it could make it into patch 3's public release.
</p>
<p>Until then, maybe check if there's a mod for it, nestled among the ones which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">make Hornet curvy</a> or ensure she'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-miss-how-much-hornet-used-to-scream-and-shout-theres-a-hollow-knight-silksong-mod-youll-shaw-ly-want-to-pick-up">yell things at you</a>.</p>
