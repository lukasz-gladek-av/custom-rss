Bah, it's never fun writing one of these, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cyan-worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> have laid off 12 of its staff members this week, supposedly cutting the studio by about half. Cyan shared the news on its social media accounts yesterday, noting that "industry conditions" have "forced" the studio to "weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025."
</p>

<p>
The post also states that it has been communicating with the entire team about the "choppy waters" it has been in, and that the layoffs weren't a surprise for the team, so it sounds like it has been a long time coming. At the very least those affected will be getting severance packages, but I imagine that's not quite enough consolation. Also worth noting is that the studio's current priority is to "secure financing for our next project."

Cyan are a long-running developer, having been founded almost 40 years ago. They're obviously best known as the studio behind Myst and Riven, having focused on remakes of both titles in recent years. The latter was just released last year, and was broadly well received, so you have to wonder what went wrong. Plenty of indie studios are struggling to find funding at the moment, but it's not always as simple as something as that, as we all know. For what it's worth, Cyan did also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyan.com/post/3llhcingbwb27">provide a list of employees impacted by the layoffs</a> to help them get new work.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope Cyan manages to pull through, and that all the laid off staff manage to land on their feet. Honestly, I can't think of another developer with half as much history, let alone 37 years of it. Fingers crossed for all those involved.

Have you been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>? Not like, literally, everywhere, but Everywhere, that sort of Roblox, sort of Fortnite, everything game from Build A Rocket Boy, a studio founded by ex-Rockstar dev and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies. That whole, uh, interactive experience or whatever you want to call it still seems to be in beta. But the first project spun off from it, MindsEye, a near-future action game that really just looks like slightly sci-fi GTA, now has a release date: June 10th, later this year. Except, I'm a little bit confused by it.
</p>

MindsEye was first formally revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-boss-unveils-mindseye-a-new-blockbuster-available-in-robloxlike-everywhere">back in 2023</a>, and was meant to, firstly, be episodic, and secondly, be available in Everywhere. As it currently stands, though, it looks like you'll be able to pick it up on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox solo. The game's <a href="https://ioi.dk/MindsEye">official website</a> makes no mention of Everywhere, nor does its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/">Steam page</a>, which is pretty sparse overall. Hell, one of its key selling points is that you're meant to be able to use all the assets featured in MindsEye to make your own games in Everywhere, but I have no idea if that will be possible now.

This latest trailer introduces you to the city the game takes part in, but it's all cutscenes, and the only gameplay trailer that's been released was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSn42TbRngY&amp;ab_channel=MindsEye">from a month ago</a>, which doesn't really show you how it plays, outside of looking like a GTA clone. Sure, there's a release date, but this thing feels like borderline vapourware.
</p>
<p>
It could always be that publisher IO Interactive (you know, those folks that make Hitman) wanted Build A Rocket Boy to get something out the door to start bringing in some money. That would just be conjecture though, don't hold me to it. Honestly, I'm a bit baffled by this whole game. I'll be on the lookout for one of those lengthy walls of text explaining how the game has been delayed because the devs really want to polish it up so you can have the best experience.
</p>
<p>
I should also mention that there were some concerns over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-devs-respond-to-nft-speculation-saying-its-built-on-unreal-engine-5-not-the-blockchain">Everywhere utilising blockchain technology</a>, in no small part thanks to the fact that Build A Rocket Boy was literally hiring for people to join its blockchain team. The studio claimed Everywhere wouldn't be using it, and that it was just for research purposes. I can't see any evidence of it in MindsEye right now, but I'd probably hold off on pre-ordering this one all the same, given its mysterious, slightly off-putting vibe.
