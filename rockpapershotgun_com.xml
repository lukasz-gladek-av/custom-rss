            <p>I don't massively feel the need for a new version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a>, even following EA's posh remake of the first, but if you've been dreaming of another visit to the game's sprawling interstellar necropolis, you could do worse than to check out the community-brewed Marker Patch. 
</p>
<p>Primarily created by Wemino, whose other projects include tune-ups for bullet-time shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>, it's a cure-all bundle of fixes for various issues with the game's PC release, including problems created by running it at higher frame-rates on heavier-duty 10 core PCs. Vemino has also increased the max number of genuinely dead Necromorphs that can be present in the environment, forced anisotropic filtering throughout, and added options to stop the game automatically connecting to online services that are no longer offered by EA.
</p><!--more-->
<p>You can find the Marker patch on <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/MarkerPatch">Github</a>. It's compatible with both the Steam release and the EA app version, with instructions for getting it working on Steam Deck or Linux. Here is a compressed/curated rundown of the contents I have produced by running my Plasma Cutter crudely over the Github page:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Stabilizes physics behavior at high framerates to eliminate the annoying flying corpses and limbs</li>
<li>Prevents the game from crashing on systems with more than 10 CPU cores </li>
<li>Corrects the VSync implementation to use the refresh rate selected in the game's settings instead of locking to 30 FPS </li>
<li>Fixes the tracking of Zealot and Hardcore difficulty completions to properly unlock rewards </li>
<li>Resolves item database conflicts where certain DLC suits incorrectly share IDs with other suits </li>
<li>Prevents crashes that can rarely occur when the game enumerates save files </li>
<li>Scales subtitle text appropriately for high resolutions</li>
<li>Implements proper raw mouse input to fix sensitivity issues </li>
<li>Blocks all DirectInput devices except mouse and keyboard to prevent unwanted camera spinning from devices like racing wheels, flight sticks, and other peripherals </li>
<li>Forces anisotropic texture filtering on all textures to improve clarity at oblique viewing angles </li>
<li>Forces proper trilinear filtering for smoother texture transitions between mipmap levels </li>
<li>Prevents connection attempts to EA servers at startup and prevents error messages from appearing </li>
<li>Increases the maximum number of bodies that can remain in the environment </li>
<li>Automatically sets the game to your screen resolution on first launch instead of defaulting to 1024×768 </li>
<li>Bypasses the EA/Visceral Games intro video on launch [when you enable this option]</li>
<li>Control which DLC items appear in the store </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The patch also does funky stuff with dinputto8 for mod compatibility. I say "funky stuff" because I don't know what a "dinputto8" is. It could be incredibly routine and entirely non-funky. For all I know, I'm basically saying "the patch does funky stuff with running on computers powered by electricity". Anyway, all the features can be customised individually. "The patch uses sensible defaults that work for most users, but allows fine-tuning of every aspect," writes Wemino.
</p><p>The odds of a full Dead Space 2 remake seem low at this stage. In April 2024, the rumour was mongered that EA had cancelled such a project in light of the original remake's sales. EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">have denied this</a>, and we've heard barely a squeak of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> since.
</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">Dead Space remake review</a> from January 2023, Liam Richardson (RPS in peace) summarised it as "luxuriously improved in small but considered ways". I myself enjoyed EA Motive's fancy reinterpretation of original developer Visceral's spacecraft setting, but found a lot of it to be adding widgets and sparkle for the sake of it. In particular, I found Isaac Clarke more compelling when he couldn't speak.

            <p>Amid a consumer boycott of their Xbox business, Microsoft are apparently ending the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies used to surveil Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">Guardian</a>, one of the publications who originally exposed the surveillance project, the company told Israeli officials last week that spy agency Unit 8200 had violated Microsoft's terms of service by storing records of civilian phone calls and other data on Azure servers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's vice-chair and president Brad Smith allegedly informed staff of the termination of the Unit 8200 partnership in an email sent on Thursday 18th September, shared with the Guardian. In that email, he said that Microsoft had "ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel ministry of defense", including cloud storage and AI services. "We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians," the email continues. "We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades."</p>
<p>The Guardian also cite another email from a senior Microsoft executive to Israel's ministry of defence, sent late last week, in which the executive noted that "[w]hile our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian's reporting."</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied technology and services to the Israeli military</a> during the latter's current Gaza offensive this May, following an investigation of the alleged use of Microsoft genAI models to facilitate airstrikes, among other operations. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In August this year, a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call found that Microsoft had worked with Unit 8200 specifically to create an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">"indiscriminate new system"</a> for gathering data on Palestinians, including a sizeable pool of non-combatants. For context, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war">alleged leaked Israeli military intelligence</a>, around 83% of the tens of thousands of Palestinians reported killed in the current conflict's first 19 months were civilians. </p>
<p>The reporting inspired the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions organisation to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">launch a campaign against Microsoft's gaming business</a>. Microsoft workers have been openly protesting against their employer's involvement with the assault on Gaza since early 2024.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft insisted that they had found "no evidence" that their technology was being used to target or harm Palestinians, following a review carried out by an unnamed third party. In August, a spokesperson announced that they would carry out another review, while insisting that "[a]t no time during this engagement has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The Guardian claim that as much as 8000 terabytes of intercepted calls were being held in Azure datacentres in the Netherlands as part of the Microsoft/Unit 8200 partnership. The paper adds that Unit 8200 appear to have swiftly moved the data elsewhere in the wake of their reporting. Israel now allegedly plan to transfer it all to Amazon's Web Services cloud platform - neither Amazon nor the Israel Defense Forces have responded to the Guardian's request for comment.</p><p>The reported partial divestment from Israel doesn't reveal which "elements" of the Guardian's reporting Microsoft have corroborated as part of their review. Microsoft continue to have a wider commercial relationship with the Israeli armed forces. They are also far from the only big overseas technology company to have significant dealings with Israel's military, before and during the current invasion and destruction of Gaza - <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">an Associated Press investigation in February</a> also mentions Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle. A UN special rapporteur has accused western tech firms at large of being complicit in an "economy of genocide".</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of developers</a>, including former Microsoft worker Abdo Mohamed, about their participation in the internal <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> movement and the wider BDS action against Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update aiming to smooth out more of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">performance problems</a> which have plagued the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since launch, especially on PC. Unfortuntely, this latest patch looks to have led to an uptick in stuttering for some players, with Gearbox recommending some shader messing around as a potential fix.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the studio, you can't say they haven't been working hard to get Borderlands 4 running a bit more smoothly since problems in that department became apparent, with this being the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-a-new-pc-patch-to-fix-crashes-progression-blockers-and-gpu-related-problems">post-launch patch targeting performance</a> in the past couple of weeks. One of them was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">confusingly noteless</a>, but hey.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, this one <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">has notes</a>, and delving into them you'll find a few tweaks to weekly activities being granted top billing before things descend into fix territory. The weekly big encore boss has been swapped to a tougher version of another existing boss and will offer more loot. The weekly wildcard mission's changed and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has been moved.
</p>
<p>In terms of fixes, Gearbox cited the rectifying of "various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes" as well as "infinite loading screens during crossplay". Characters should also load up faster in menus, and their animations have been updated to match the fixes. Sadly, it seems that the update's actually led some players to experience more performance problems, with Gearbox acknowledging this in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>"Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing," they wrote. "If you're still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer's approved method." If problems persist, you'll have to <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/categories/39763360813843">file a support ticket</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hellwalker: now always spawns with Fire element</li>
<li>Tediore weapons: +10% Damage and +10% magazine size</li>
<li>Order Pistol Lucky Clover (Rocket Reload): increased fire rate</li>
<li>Order Sniper Rifle Fisheye: increased Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins has <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643">revealed in a tweet</a> that the game's next patch'll be much heavier on the balancing tweaks. "As a note, we had too many Vault Hunter buffs to safely fit into today's big update," he wrote. "Instead, we broke up them into their own balance update that we're targeting to release early next week instead."</p><p>Here's hoping that Gearbox can get their shooty thing running nicely soon, especially since yapping CEO Randy Pitchford thankfully looks to have stopped giving impromptu setup advice on the socials. As for the game itself, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Jasmine Mannan gave it a go for us</a> and generally liked what these four bordered lands had to offer.</p>
