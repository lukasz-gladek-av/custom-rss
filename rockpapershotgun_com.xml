            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/replaced">Replaced</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/release-date-for-dystopian-platformer-replaced-slips-to-2024">long-in-development dystopian platformer from Sad Cat Studios</a>, has had its release pushed back a little further. The studio have taken on feedback from the demo they recently released on Steam - that's the one which kept surnaming me - and reckon a few more weeks of acting on it are in order to get the game ready to go.</p>

<p>Sad Cat announced Replaced's new release date of April 14th in <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889">a statement</a> posted to the socials. "As a small team working on our very first title, we've poured everything we have into this project," they wrote. "While the game is technically finished, reaching this final stretch has shown us that we need just a few more weeks to ensure the experience is exactly what you deserve. We want the version of Replaced you play on day one to be polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you.</p>
<p>"The response to our Steam demo has been the ultimate fuel for us. To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible. We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p><p>The cyberpunk platformer's demo will be staying up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED">Steam</a> in the meantime, so you can at least use the extra waiting to to give it another go or try it for the first time. If you want my thoughts on that demo, you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-has-a-demo-out-and-its-wonderfully-atmospheric-when-youre-not-plummeting-a-short-distance">find them here</a>.</p>
<p>The short version is that I found Replaced plenty visually striking and with definite potential story-wise, if a bit repetitive when it came to the activities you get up to as an AI in a grizzled futuristic bloke's body. I also got shot in the head through a box by a giant evil light.</p>

            <p>
Why is everything rolling sideways on my desk all of a sudden? What’s this mysterious force, dragging my chair towards the wall? Why are all the cars in the vicinity tumbling and rolling in the direction of *checks press release* ...North Carolina, USA? It can only be gravitational disturbance caused by the impending 1.0 release of a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> project. This time it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heart-of-the-machine">Heart of the Machine</a>, a “4X-style”, “dimension-busting” sci-fi game developed by Arcen Games and published by Hooded Horse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I’m always up for a new Hooded Horse gig, but I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-strategy-game-terra-invicta-is-an-alien-invasion-sim-so-vast-and-slow-the-aliens-seem-lost-within-it">still trying to figure out spacewar in Terra Invictus</a>. And now, ladies and gentlebots, you would have me contend with a game in which I play a super-advanced AI trying to conquer a grim future civilisation from the inside. A game that will last an estimated 90-175 hours. A game that boasts of “a mind-boggling array of goals, story-threads, and opportunities for players to pursue as they seek to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving from itself.”
</p>
<p>
Still, at least this is the <em>fun</em> kind of AI, the homely 80s action movie breed of AI that simply wishes to weaponise bees, build android armies and hack fortified skyscrapers. Not the actually existing, present-day kind of AI that consists of a billion typewriter monkeys who want to summarise your emails so your boss can make your labour 1.2% more profitable, at least till the world runs out of silicon, water and fossil fuels. I exaggerate! I hope I’m exaggerating. Besides, there probably are typewriter monkeys in Heart of the Machine, which also promises “parkour bears”, velociraptors and cat palaces.
</p>
<p>
“The 1.0 update will usher in a whole new ending, with four potential variants that involve everything from wormholes to last-minute betrayals, to players winning control over the entire city,” explains the press release. The developer has a longer account of the changes (and post-1.0 plans) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001070/view/742666698308452997?l=english">Steam</a>, which is quite interesting. I wasn’t expecting a Fire Emblem: Three Houses comparison. You can also find the game on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heart_of_the_machine">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/heart-of-the-machine-84306f">Epic Games Store</a>.
