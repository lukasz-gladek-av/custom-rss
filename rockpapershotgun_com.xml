<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a> developers Lovely Hellplace and their sinister backers at DreadXP have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/entropy">Entropy</a> - a turn-based party RPG inspired by classic Japanese RPGs, which retains Dread Delusion’s fungal pixel aesthetics. 
</p>
<p>
Like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, it starts with a theatre show. You play a rank thespian initially equipped with a simple prop sword. But then horrible creatures crash the stage, and it’s time to armour up your troupe and quest forth to snuff out a demon incursion. What’s the best Shakespeare line to invoke here, hmm. Ah yes: “target their elemental weaknesses!” Hamlet said that before he shanked Polonius through the curtain. No, don’t google to check, dear reader – I am in haste. Quickly, watch the below trailer.

“In this dying age, only pockets of humanity remain,” expounds the press release. “There was no grand apocalyptic event to speak of; only the cruel march of time and the inexplicable infertility of the world led us here. Accursed creatures stalk the barren lands between settlements, which are themselves terrible places; squalid, medieval, and mostly ruled by tyrants.” Ah, you'd almost suspect that Lovely Hellspace founder James Wragg lives in England. 
</p><p>
Having escaped the backwater-sounding burg of Draenog, you're left to make sense of an “expansive” world map. I’m interested to know if Entropy will continue with the pocket-sized and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">Morrowind-flavoured</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-worlds-can-afford-to-be-small-as-long-as-they-feel-vast">open world-ish format</a> of Dread Delusion. You’ll gather a party of up to six characters, with the option of hiring mercs if any comrades get slain. There is levelling, needless to say, encompassing stat boosts and unlockable perks.
</p>
<p>
I’m not wildly convinced by the snippets of battle from the trailer, which seem a bit by-the-numbers, but it’s nice to be engulfed by another dreadful delusion. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3940340/Entropy/">coming to Steam</a> in 2026.

Amid the madness of Gamescom, we somehow skipped the most important game of the year. Cheese Rolling is a multiplayer ragdoll game inspired by the ancient Gloucestershire, England pastime of racing a hunk of dairy down a hill. 
</p>
<p>
The hill in question is Cooper's Hill at Brockworth, and the ceremony apparently dates back to at least 1826 - providing you trust the account of that year's Gloucester town crier - which makes the sport of cheese rolling at least 47 years older than Rock Paper Shotgun. The cheese in question is usually Double Gloucester - scandalously, they resorted to a foam replica in 2013 - and is given a strict one-second headstart.

I hadn't heard of Cheese Racing before, but I do have relatives down Gloucestershire way, and now I fear for them. I'm not just saying that because I'm vegan, though yes, I'm tempted to go sabotage the festivities by stealing into what I assume is a closely-guarded tent at night, and replacing the wheel with a large ball of tempeh. But mostly I am concerned for their physical safety and moral wellbeing.</p><p>Apparently, four kilograms of cheese can do a royal fuckload of damage when it achieves maximum velocity. 16 people were injured during the 1993 event, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_Hill_Cheese-Rolling_and_Wake">Wikipedia</a>, "four of them seriously". What. Also, Wikipedia claims that <em>nobody has ever caught the cheese</em>, at least in recorded history. The winner is whoever crosses the finishing line second. So this is just a regular old race, in practice, with a wholly unnecessary and patently unsafe fermented milk modifier.</p>
<p>The official title for the event is "Cheese-Rolling and Wake", and while local historians insist they don't mean "wake" as in "funeral", you do have to wonder if this is the distorted folk memory of a terrible accident at a hilltop dairy. Kind of like how "London's burning, London's burning" is now a charming nursery rhyme.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to contact the organisers and suggest they play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809440/Cheese_Rolling/">the Steam version of Cheese Racing</a> instead. Created by mercurial developer The Interviewed - their very name a brainlocking allusion to a history of media relations that does not, seemingly, exist - it's more dangerous than traditional Gloucestershire cheese-rolling in that it features an active volcano, but less dangerous in that it is not real. No bones will be broken hounding this cheese, unless you try to play it while driving a bus. Also, it supports eight player sessions and proximity voice chat. There's some paid DLC in the shape of a suit of armour costing £1.48 - as far as I can deduce, this isn't some kind of scam, but tread cautiously, ye who fell foul of the evil <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">Banana</a>.
</p>
<p>
The real selling point, though, is that you can actually catch the renegade curd in this one. My friends in Gloucestershire: thanks to the miracle of modern technology, you need no longer harm and humiliate yourselves in your hunger for dairy. Here is a computer. Behold, there is cheese in the computer! Now all you have to do is roll the cheese down the hill - no wait, not the ACTUAL COMPUTER

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> custom campaign mod has emerged onto the Nexus like Gale's mitt through that portal, and it's one you'll likely want to check out if you fancy getting nostalgic for one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s classic siblings. Return to Candlekeep, as you might have gleaned from the title, aims to recreate the prologue of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, by taking you to a certain library fortress.</p>
<p>It's not surprising someone's given this a go. After all, daunting tasks as such things might be, a good number of the BG3 custom campaigns being put together with the Moonglasses toolkit have opted to try their hand at taking players to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">revamped versions of locations from the previous two games</a>.</p>

<p>Enter catchily-named modder 786r786, who released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18315">Return to Candlekeep</a> this weekend just gone. Re-creating the opening area from the first game, it'll let you wander around everywhere from Candlekeep library, to the inn, and the pool/altar combo that makes up the Temple of Oghma.</p>
<p>You get a good look around these, plus a gander at the custom main menu, character creation screen and camp the modder's included, in the over 20 minute-long tour video below. They don't do much talking to NPCs in that, likely on account of the mod not having any voice acting at the moment, but write in the description that they've pulled across all of the quests and dialogue lines you'd expect from such a recreation. There should be enough to keep you occupied for "about an hour thirty at most", which is why 786r786 has dubbed this a mini-campaign.</p>

<p>There are some teething issues it's worth being aware of, not that such a thing's that surprising given the testing ground advanced BG3 campaign mods still are at this point. Parts of buildings can appear unloaded, leaving roofs awkwardly floating with no supports, while NPC helmets can "disconnect from their head at a distance". On the plus side, cases of long-term helmet hair affliction are likely lower among the residents of Candlekeep than those of the base game.</p>
<p>786r786 says there's nothing they can do about these issues at the moment, and as for whether they'll flesh out the mod more going forwards, they've a one word answer: "potentially".</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they keep at it, this is a cool thing for them to have done, given Larian themselves considered working a return to Candlekeep into Baldur's Gate 3 while they were weaving their development magic. The devs even got as far as coming up with ideas for a zany seer chilling in the basement, as our Edwin, former RPSer/BG3 lead writer Adam Smith, and keen journo/Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">chatted about last year</a>.</p>
