            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update 2.3 dropped last week, delivering a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">bunch of new ways</a> to spice up your dystopian drives and more additions to possibly the most in-depth photo mode a game's ever had. CD Projekt also added in the ability for you to dismiss the freeroam ridealong Johnny Silverhand they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-now-scan-and-steal-paint-jobs-from-any-car-in-cyberpunk-2077-plus-more-customisation-with-the-22-update">added in previously</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who finds cyberKeanu a bit more grating at times than is socially acceptable, I was pleased. However, over the weekend a modder's released something that might tempt me into bringing him back, if only so V can respond to being told off for crashing by sarkily calling ol'Reevsey mum.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22694?tab=description">Responsive V</a>, and it's the work of MisterChedda. They've dug into V's voicelines, both used and unused, to give you a bunch of extra animated reactions to incidents that often happen when you're freely roaming around Night City. You know, the likes of bumping into a pedestrian, which now might cause V to wheel around, give them the finger and also say the rude word the finger means, just to add insult to injury.</p>
<p>These reactions vary in intensity, and apply to everything from nicking cars, to having MaxTac or Newatch rock up, and your vehicle ending up either exploded or in the sea. I assume that last one makes you go 'Aw shucks, what am I like?', while every nearby NPC says 'Who else but V?'.</p>

<p>By far the most important reaction the mod adds is the ability to quick clap back at Silverhand if he's spawned in your passenger seat, and you happen to drive in a fashion that triggers one of his six or so lines telling you to not drive so badly. All you can do in the base game is suffer in silence if the man dishes out one of these critiques, and while patch 2.3 does now let you employ the nuclear option of banishing him back into your skull for a couple of days, having a quick back-and-forth as the mod allows is a far superior solution.</p>
<p>It's not a full conversation, so you don't have to worry about being further distracted from your wheelwork by Silverhand getting into a rant about the deep philosophy involved in remembering to brake when you take a corner. It's just a nice little jab exchange that'll make Johnny feel a bit more like a proper passenger, rather than a moody Woody doll whose pull string gets yanked when you wreck your Aerondight.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go and having V respond 'All right, mom' next time they hit a tree, you'll need to make sure you've got the Phantom Liberty DLC, plus these requirements: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>. The latter allows Responsive V to have its own in-game menu where you can tweak what'll solicit one of these extra reactions to your liking.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-23-lets-you-ditch-ridealong-keanu-reeves-but-i-raise-you-responding-to-his-driving-critiques-via-this-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bang bang. A Doom modder who's been busy recreating the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the setting for some irradiated boomer shooting has released a fresh trailer to the public for the first time in years.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin looks to have been quietly beavering away at GZDoom WAD Fallout: Bakersfield since releasing its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjJM9HAqqk">last teaser in 2022</a>, having posted fairly regular update blogs for supporters on his <a href="https://boosty.to/red888guns">Boosty profile</a>. For the rest of us, this fresh trailer's the best look we've gotten yet at what Berezin - who's worked on classic Fallout mods like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509613179">Olympus 2207</a> and <a href="https://cambragol.github.io/Fallout-Sonora/">Fallout: Sonora</a> - has been up to when not <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">doing stuff</a> for publishers New Blood Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the trailer, it kicks off with the sort of pullback through some ruins as fifties-ish music plays that I'm fairly sure you're mandated by law to include in all Fallouty things. Once we're in the shoes of our Vault Doomweller, the shootiness starts.</p>
<p>Roaming around the mod's version of the first Fallout game's Necropolis, you'll be shooting and stabbing away at hordes of ferals, as your face contorts and grimaces on a status bar that's very much the unholy Doollout/Falloom union that you'd hope.</p>

<p>There's a wonderful crunchiness to every attack, as enemies burst into piles of gore that'll make your average bloody mess perk taker erupt into squeals of pure ecstacy. Then, at the end, mirroring how the fight through the city of the dead in Fallout 1 goes, there's a showdown with Harry the Super Mutant. He thinks he's gonna beat your head now, and he might if you're not quick to start blasting.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like a really cool way to flip an old school Fallout sequence on its head. The mod is currently 60% done, all in all. Berezin breaks that down into four areas, with walls/tiles and scenery both being 80% of the way there, while weapons/UI and creatures are only 50 and 30% sorted respectively. There's no firm release date as of yet, with the modder only committing to getting Fallout: Bakersfield out there before the 2020s are over.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm happy to wait, and I'm not just saying that because it looks like Berezin's pretty handy at blowing  annoyances to bits with a beefy virtual shotgun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level]]></content:encoded>
