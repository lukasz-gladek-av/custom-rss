            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> turns 10 years old this week, and developers Obsidian are celebrating with a patch that "addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more". Oh, and they've also announced plans to give the real-time-with-pausing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> a turn-based combat mode. 
</p>
<p>
What did you get for your 10th birthday? If it wasn't a turn-based combat mode, then your parents officially love you less than Obsidian does Pillars Of Eternity. You might want to bring that up at the next family gathering. I'm already texting my dad.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The forum post revealing all this shares little about how the new turn-based system will work, but I think we can all agree that developers should capriciously add turn-based modes to games more often. I, for one, hope to see more development teams digging up ancient real-time games and sadistically grafting on initiative stats and order bars, like Frankenstein wannabes going through a Clockwork phase. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine if instead of a bunch of cannabis-skinned AK47s and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">seemingly AI-generated anime women</a>, the next Call Of Duty content plop transformed Warzone into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. Imagine if Street Fighter had a dual-turn system derived from deckbuilders, with players queuing up attacks simultaneously. (This has been done, yes? Surely it's been done. One of the Puzzle Fighter variants, perhaps.)</p>
<p>With hand on heart, I cannot think of a real-time game I wouldn't love to rediscover as a turn-based game - it worked out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-review">wonderfully</a> for Gears Of War. Admittedly, this is partly because I am very elderly for a games journalist and now fear and despise any game that expects me to outmaneouvre anything faster than a soap bubble.
</p>
<p>
The other positive here, I guess, is that it's a smidgeon of reassurance for people who worry that the Pillars universe will be first-person real-time from here on out, given the apparent success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. Perhaps Avowed will get a turn-based mode next? Something in the vein of Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, perhaps? Anyway, Obsidian will be soliciting playtesters for their new mode "in the near future". As for that new patch, <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the full changelog is here</a>.

        <p>17 people let go, including a senior combat designer</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to <a href="https://spr.ly/l/6010F8AdQ">a social media statement</a>, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by <a href="https://x.com/TheMarkVernon/status/1905041591141802451">this Xitter post</a>, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.)
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">wrote Graham last year</a>. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year."
</p>
<p>
Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">being published by Amazon Games</a>, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Embracer announced plans last year to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">split themselves three ways</a> in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion</a>. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises.
</p>
<p>
Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.
