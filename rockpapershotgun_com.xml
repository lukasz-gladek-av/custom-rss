            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> is a six player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> extraction spooper that currently sits atop Steam's best seller charts, having amassed around 70k players the week following early access launch on Feb 26, and another 160k since then. That's around 230 thousand players avoiding knifey chef frogs and persistent ducklings while extracting valuables to fill a cash quota. It's a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> but even heavier on the absurdity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this popularity comes down to two things. Firstly, the game is a verdant flub factory, stuffed with the sort of chaotic physics mishaps that translate very well to short video clips. Even the loot extraction point can kill you if lingered in too long. Secondly, the 'Jim Henson does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata' robots you play as flap their mouths in time to your mic chatter, making even the most bowel-curdling fear shrieks from your teammates look like a hammy comedy routine.</p>

<p>I'd usually emit a croaking complaint about being too old for anything viral - the acrid dust cloud from my throat lingering in the air momentarily before cascading downwards and coating me in a grimy sheen of irrelevancy - but R.E.P.O. actually looks great. As it stands, though, you need five willing friends to play: a truly biblical quantity of mates, in the sense that it'd be faster to carve co-op partners from my own ribs than hash out that sort of byzantine scheduling.</p>
<p>Good news re: my organs staying shielded - developer Semiwork are planning on introducing public or private matchmaking. This'll come with a kick button to keep players honest, although they do say it's not quite that simple, since server coding is new ground for them. Here's the update video.</p>

<p>Joining ironmates mode is a new museum level, which they show off by demonstrating some award-winning box parkour. There's also some quality of life bits, like a border at extraction points to show when loot is out of bounds so you don't accidentally let it get crushed. Semiwork also show off a squinty, angry facial expression. Finally, there's a bucket you can pop over the duckling monster that likes to imprint motherhood on one of your crew then follow you around getting in your way and biting anyone that tries to touch it.</p>
<p>My current idea o' the day is Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the 'chronotope' - time and space configurations as a kind of contextual bubble -  as mentioned by valued RPS community member #9976 in the comments to Sunday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-80-days-heavens-vault-and-a-highland-songs-jon-ingold?view=comme">Booked For The Week</a>. A fifteen minute internet rabbit hole with coffee this morning led me to <a href="https://youtu.be/r4yluKPhTKE">this video</a> by the eminently listenable Belgian sociolinguist Jan Blommaert, who gives the example of a lecture: the space is the hall, the time is the lecture slot, and this particular chronotope encourages or necessities certain identities, roles, or modes of behaviour within in. An insightful framing of the twin navigations of interpersonal relationships and horror-harried spaces in social extraction games? You, uh, you might be starting to see why I'm enthusiastic about R.E.P.O.'s no-mates mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I very much recommend the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a>, so it's with no shade I say that I'm using 'strategy' here the same way a tube passenger might use a hardback of Ulysses to envelop their novelisation of 2 Fast 2 Furious. Griddy placement and tower defence tactics are involved, but this is primarily a game about launching rocks at dickheads. This is fine by me: launching rocks at dickheads is as solid a premise as any videogame needs to have.</p>

<p>You'll start off with a 9 square grid surrounding a castle, then fill out those plots each turn by picking one of three cards. Some are buildings, like a cemetery that summons imps to fight in place of your slain units. Some are troops who'll rush to the centre of the battlefield at the beginning of each round. Your troops fight automatically, but you do have an important job here. I'm not sure if I mentioned it already: it's dropping rocks on heads. When you drop a rock really good, your dying foes squeak in falsetto anguish like a Lemming opening a devastating phone bill.</p>
<p>I'm being a touch facetious when I say it's all about rocks and heads. The demo is naturally a stripped-back sample, and even within it, I did start to notice some emerging combos. I gifted a square to some mercenary units early. They grew in number the more gold I had, which meant I could skip turns guilt-free by throwing cards down a well later, since each time I got bonus gold and so more bodies. There's also plenty of choice in how you expand your original plot, with positional buffs for certain buildings</p>
<p>Steam sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Build up your city into the most powerful of all kingdoms. Through endless combinations of buildings, troops, spells and positioning, find ways to break the game and become overpowered. Grow your kingdom in strategic ways, prepare for dozens of unique events, and show the world your kingdom can last longer than any other."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the full game contains lore, I would like to know where the rocks come from. They evidently come from your castle but there's no catapult or anything, just a void containing infinite rocks and the means to launch them. Gargantuan slingshot? Monkey with strong tail? Hellstorm rock battery? Answers, please, when the full game launches this April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
