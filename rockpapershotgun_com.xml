            <p>
Yes, yes, you're reading that headline right. Yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> leak has taken place, if you can believe it, showing 15 whole minutes of the game that we all know exists but hasn't really been shown off in an official capacity. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leak in March</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">even just last week</a>, which might have confirmed the presence of a battle royale mode. This latest leak offers something new though: the return of Rush mode, a mode that's appeared in a number of previous Battlefield entries.
</p>
<p>
The footage in question, which originated from the Chinese social media site bilibili, keeps getting taken down given that this is very obviously meant to be under NDA and not something the general public is meant to see. So, I'm not going to link to it anywhere, because inevitably whatever clip I do share here will be gone by the time I wake up tomorrow (here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1llyrat/battlefield_6_alpha_leak_rush_game_mode_27_06_2025/">link to a Reddit page</a> where the footage was available at one point, just for some amount of evidence). The footage in question shows off pretty much what you'd expect from a Battlefield game, i.e. unrealistic combat scenarios, destructible environments, commentary from gamers getting annoyed at other people but truthfully more at themselves due to their inner turmoil.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how this version of Rush might be different from previous incarnations, I honestly can't say. I've not played any Battlefield games, it all just looks like your typical military <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> to me. From what I can tell a majority of the footage is from the perspective of the attacking team - Rush generally sees a team of attackers, who have a limited number of respawns, go against defenders, who have an unlimited number of respawns, the former trying to detonate two charges in the latter's base.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that this is all a work in progress, some of the vehicles aren't finished for example, and there's always the chance the mode doesn't make it into the full release. In any case, this is your regular reminder that NDAs will never stop gamers from sharing clips online.
