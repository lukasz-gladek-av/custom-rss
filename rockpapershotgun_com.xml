            <p>Yee-haw. Excuse me, I meant to say that wild west <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> Tombwater has walked into the saloon and ordered a release date. 'I'll have November 12th, 2025', it growled, while flashing its big iron at everyone in the watering hole to show it meant business.</p>
<p>Originally roaming the plains of <a href="https://maxatrillionator.itch.io/tombwater">Itch.io</a>, this funky-looking game comes from Max Mraz, developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oceans-heart">Ocean's Heart</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> tribute <a href="https://maxatrillionator.itch.io/yarntown">Yarntown</a>, and Jake Wagner. The duo have trained their six-shooters on Steam, where you can already find a demo to check out.</p>

<p>You've got a bit of time to do so as well, with that November 12th release still being a little while away. It's not like there are any other big  metroidvaniascoming out in the interim to scratch that itch for you. As far as what you're in for goes, here's Tombwater's story blurb:</p>
<blockquote>Enter Tombwater, where shadows lurk and whispers echo from the deep of abandoned silver mines. This is no longer a town where people live, but a town where people die. A once-thriving community, its people have now been gripped by the tendrils of madness. Step into the well-worn boots of a lone gunslinger, drawn to the eerie, decaying streets by the disappearance of Sheriff Elliott Flintwood — a long-lost friend who’s fought to save the town. Uncover the truth by facing unforgettable terrors and fighting through the madness.</blockquote>
<p>There you go, not-Clint-Eastwood's nowhere to be found, get your bum in some chaps and go fight some eldrich horrors. Those horrors, glimpsed from the game's top-down 2D perspective look pretty freaky too. The deputy's covered in red stuff and bones, and over 20 other boss battles are promised as you explore the likes of canyons and mines with some secrets tucked away.</p><p>I'm a bit bemused at a western being as proud to boast melee weapons, spells and tonic brewing as it is a bunch of pistols, shotguns and repeaters you can use to duel demonic dudes to death, but variety is the spice of life. Well, having someone spit chewing tobacco into your lunch was probably the spice of wild west life, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can check out Tombwater's demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308200/Tombwater/">here</a>.</p>

It’s never too late to get mad about the untimely fate of Human Head Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. It helps that people keep leaking videos of the thing. The latest batch includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">an opening sequence</a>, a full mission playthrough from an open world, a flythrough of an undercity area, a prototype chase sequence, and scenes of combat. Watch the bulk of them below, and grieve. Alas for Killian Samuels, the beanie-wearing US marshal turned alien bounty-hunter. He looked so humdrum back in 2012, especially when compared to the original 2006 game’s Cherokee protagonist Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi. Still, he has a certain tragic charisma, in hindsight.

<p>
If you missed the original Prey, ‘twas an uneven, UFO-ransacking first-person shooter with fancy level-splicing portal technology that has now been almost totally eclipsed by comparable features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Narbacular Drop 2</a>. A lot of people liked it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prey-2006-review">not including John Walker</a> (RPS in peace). Human Head started making a sequel shortly after the original’s release, but according to a few former studio members, they only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-prey-2-confirmed">began developing Prey 2 in earnest</a> after the rights had passed to ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda. 
</p>
<p>
Where the first game had been relatively linear, the second was to be an open world affair with a bounty-hunting theme. Bethesda announced it in 2011. But then something went wrong. Human Head quietly called time on the project near end of 2011, despite being “very close to an alpha state, with all major content pieces represented”, in the words of former project lead Chris Rhinehart. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ugh-prey-2-seems-to-have-been-cancelled">Rumours of Prey 2’s cancellation</a> swirled around over 2012, with Bethesda removing the game from their website.

<p>
Then, in 2013, it was reported that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/human-dead-dishonored-dev-rumored-to-be-on-prey-2">the project had been reassigned to Dishonored developers Arkane</a>, scrapping all previous work by Human Head in the process. Bethesda officially cancelled Prey 2 in 2014. In 2016, they announced that Arkane would develop a series reboot.
</p><p>
Released in 2017, Arkane’s Prey is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">a dashedly fine game</a>, one of the swooniest and spaciest of immersive sims, but it's hard not to mourn for Human Head. The full story of Prey 2's cancellation has yet to be told, but according to reports at the time, Bethesda pushed tough deadlines and feature requests on an increasingly cash-strapped Human Head while simultaneously looking to acquire them. Human Head eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumor-prey-2-development-stricken-by-dev-strike">downed tools in protest</a>, and the two companies were unable to haggle it out before Human Head’s contract with Bethesda ran out in 2012. 
</p>
<p>
Accounts of events differ between the companies, as you’d expect. Bethesda have resisted the idea that they were conniving to acquire Human Head, arguing that the project simply didn’t meet their standards. Having watched these videos, I'm inclined to say that Human Head should have been allowed to go the distance.

<p>
The leaked videos show off a little of the game’s planned open world bounty action. The game would have let you travel around a teeming alien city that reminds me of Coruscant and G-Police. You’d have been able to boost-glide and ledge-grab to surprise opponents. 
</p><p>
The video reveals a bustling population of aliens, all of whom sound like they have acute laryngitis, and some nightclubs featuring holographic erotic dancers, because no self-respecting blade runner’s local can do without a holodancer or two. You’d have been able to profile NPCs with a scanner, take them down with electric boladeros, and enlist the odd Klatoonian as a meatshield.

<p>
I’m more sold on the setting than the mechanics – there are passing hovercars, cargo trains, and distant flying billboards with a whole other FPS playing on them – but it looks, out of context, like a project that had legs. We will never know whether the studio could have seen it through: Human Head eventually closed doors in 2019. Beanieman RIP.
