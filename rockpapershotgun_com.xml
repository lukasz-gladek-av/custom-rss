            <p>
Larian's new Divinity RPG should spend a lot less time in development than their previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> - or at least, that's the dream. CEO Swen Vincke wants the process to take "three to four years" in total, which seemingly includes an early access period. 
</p>
<p>
For context, we first heard that Larian were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">officially working on a new game</a> (two, actually) back in April 2024. Here, let me run those numbers through Rock Paper Shotgun's in-house Mirror of Fate. Gosh. Assuming I have performed the rituals correctly, that means Divinity will launch out of early access in 2027 or 2028. In less positive news, Larian are reportedly making limited internal use of generative AI for tasks such as concept art development and internal presentations.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Announced in 2019, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took about six years to develop in entirety, but some of that is owing to delays from Covid lockdowns. Still, shaving off a couple of years while still aiming to deliver <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-reveal-a-new-divinity-rpg-that-boasts-greater-breadth-depth-than-ever-before">"greater breadth and depth than ever before"</a> is no small endeavour, even when you allow for the effects of the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"I think three to four years is much healthier than six years," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier in a new interview, conducted just before Divinity's announcement at Geoff Fest last week. One way they're hoping to speed things up is to develop quests and storylines in parallel. For this, they're enlisting a lot more writers and scripters - Larian currently employ 530 people across seven locations, including their recently founded Warsaw studio.
</p><p>
That said, Vincke feels that "the creative process itself actually is something you cannot accelerate", telling Schreier that BG3 was a much better game for giving the developers time to explore concepts and bin things off. "People underestimate how many times we're implementing something and realize in the middle that it's just not going to work," he said.
</p>
<p>
The less salubrious side of all this is that Larian have apparently been "pushing hard on generative AI", in Schreier's phrase, using generative AI tools "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text". 
</p>
<p>
According to Vincke, the developers aren't using generative AI to make things that appear in the finished game. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves." Apparently, some Larian devs have resisted the introduction of AI tools, but Vincke says that "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>While Vincke doesn't make this connection in the Bloomberg piece, I imagine the automating of certain tasks is related to the desire to get Divinity out faster. Still, Schreier also paraphrases Vincke as saying that there have been no "big gains in efficiency" as a result of the AI push. The utility of generative AI in the workplace at large remain heavily <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">disputed</a>, and the technology continues to be associated with <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">spiking electricity consumption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">the mass-production of clone art and misinformation</a> in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">oligarchal profits</a>.
</p><p>AI-generated art tends to get referred to as "slop". There's certainly a lot of literal slop in the Divinity announcement trailer, below - it's full of mud, blood and sick, but we can seemingly rest assured that all of that was hand-puked by humans rather than projectile-vomited by a generative AI. Somebody please resurrect the screaming ghost of Jean-Paul Sartre to explain to me what kind of nausea I'm feeling. No, you are not allowed to generate a clone of Sartre using ChatGPT.</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the chat, Vincke expresses anxiety about Larian's current scale (yet more of that hot, delicious context: unlike many larger publicly owned game companies, Larian have not carried out any mass layoffs in the past couple of years).</p>
<p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," he says. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."
</p><p>
I spoke to Vincke myself this week, focussing more on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">the direction of the new Divinity RPG</a>, while finding time for some hard-hitting reporting about Larian's blatant swinophobia. Amongst other things, he confirmed that it's a turn-based CRPG successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, with a world that skews darker than you'll find in Baldur's Gate 3.

            <p>I can't believe it either, your majesty. While outlining their plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> in the new year, Paradox have teased a major expansion by turning around and revealing a work-in-progress donkey. They've also spilled the beans on some of the tweaks coming with yet another "realm maintenance" update as part of this <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-191-2025-in-review.1888979/">year-end dev diary</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following 2025's chapter four additions, which culminated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">October's All Under Heaven DLC</a> extending the courtly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategising</a> into medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia, 2026 will be the year of chapter five. As has become the norm, that means two more major expansions.</p>
<p>What're they about? Well, here's the main hint Paradox are offering, at least when it comes to one of the pair:</p>

<p>Either your next kingdom's Far Far Away, or something involving trading/farming is afoot. "If 2025 was the year of going wide (Nomads, all of Asia) then 2026 will be a year of depth," the studio scrawled above their ass. "We’re going to go back and revisit some parts of the game that’ll deepen the overall game experience. Just like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> set the stage for All Under Heaven, the All Under Heaven expansion is setting the stage for this future content. There are some central areas of the game that we’ve been itching to improve for a long, long time now."</p><p>Alongside those add-ons, 2026'll see CK3 get another free "realm maintenance" update aimed at revamping existing areas of the game or enacting less urgent changes based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-have-a-direct-impact-on-crusader-kings-3s-future-and-get-a-few-hints-to-where-the-grand-strategy-is-heading-next">player feedback</a>. This update's being aimed at a release "early in the second quarter of the year". Among its tweaks will be a retooling of accolades to make them more rewarding and easier to pass on to a knight's squire, while attributes being made clearer and there'll be "more agency" around earning them. Also, Paradox wrote, "Glory will get a bit of a revamp, so it is no longer lost when the knights die in battle (it’s their job after all, and dying in battle can be quite glorious in these times…)."</p>
<p>The studio then went off to show off how some of the interfaces around these changes will look, with some panels showing off more in-depth visualisation for the various story cycles your ruler can be wrapped up in. If you get a pet cat or dog, there'll also now be a tab where you can read a bio for them, detailing facts like their age, fur colour, and whether they're a good boy.</p>
<p>None of the pet info slides shown off suggest you can get a pet donkey once the mystery ass expansion drops, but there's still plenty of time for that to be rectified once the calendar flips to next year.</p>
