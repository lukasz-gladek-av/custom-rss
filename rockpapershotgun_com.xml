Mountainous town-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/laysara-summit-kingdom">Laysara: Summit Kingdom</a> has received a Sandbox update that, essentially, turns a game about settling the slopes of precisely <em>one</em> mountain into a lightweight trading empire simulator. Where the early access game's existing modes have you doing up one Bonsai Everest at a time, Sandbox lets you switch between several and export goods for other alpine mayors to buy. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a significant addition to an early access project that had our Nic Reuben in fits of ecstasy, smashing his Grinchy heart asunder to reveal the wholesome yak fanboi lurking within. "Possibly the prettiest city builder I've ever seen," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/laysara-summit-kingdom-is-a-stunning-mountainous-city-builder-thats-out-now-in-early-access">declared</a> back at the game's early access launch, like a judge at a yak contest waving around a yak-hair bagful of yak-hair rosettes. Nic is away this week, so I am reasonably safe from repercussions over painting him as a smelly weirdo yak enthusiast. That said, I might ban him from the comments in advance, just to be safe.
</p>
<p>
I played a bit of Laysara: Summit Kingdom's demo last year myself, and yeah, it's good, though its fantasy world seems heavily informed by caricatures about Himalayan communities and Tibetan monasteries. Its town construction is shaped by elevation, with different kinds of vegetation and other resources and perils at higher altitudes. There's the omni-present risk of avalanches, but you can fortify your towns and plant forests to redirect the vengeful ice.</p>
<p>I never did a lot of it in the demo, but I do like this subliminal "avalanche sculpting sim" element. It makes me wonder if Polish developers Quite OK Games harbour any systemic aspirations of the "get lava computers working inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>" variety.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823950/Laysara_Summit_Kingdom/">As detailed on Steam</a>, Sandbox Mode adds a World Map for switching between towns. You'll have a few unlocked to begin with, expanding your empire of peakvilles by raising temples on summits. Building temples also increases your research level across your entire empire. "Six new mountains!" the Steam changelog adds, like somebody forgetting the lyrics for The Twelve Days of Christmas. If they'd put that in a footnote I could have made a joke about foothills.
</p>
<p>
The changelog includes various smaller tweaks. They've added the option to construct ice altars during Free Build on certain maps, "a more detailed UI research panel, showing where does research comes from", and "more precise cursor detection when clicking on Advanced Yak Breeding". Got to be surgical, when match-making yaks.
</p>
<p>
The developers comment in the post that Sandbox Mode is about "expanding your kingdom in whatever way you see fit" with only "a few tiny story bits and a single global objective to provide a general sense of purpose". That said, it's also a taste of their plans for the game's forthcoming campaign, which will be "a more 'directed' sandbox experience with more detailed objectives (similar to what you've seen in the Scenarios)". The campaign will arrive with the game's 1.0 release later this year.

            <p>Open world sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beta-decay">Beta Decay</a> is being delightfully greedy. The game's retro PS1-inspired art style hides some furious ambitions. It will be a "dystopian RPG where you can build spaceships, join factions, and fight for territory in a newly discovered star system," according to the Steam blurb. The game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beta-decay-is-a-low-poly-dystopian-rpg-whose-grimy-cover-shooting-shows-promise">previous trailer</a> showed some swish (if somewhat prototypey) cover shooter combat. But the game now plans to launch into early access this year, developers Rotoscope Studios have announced. And this time they've brought the big guns, literally. Mech some time for the trailer below. </p>

<p>Ah. That is some primo PlayStation 1 polygoning. There's no tight release date for this early access shooter, just a loose "2025". The open world survivalist combat is already looking more polished, a smog-smudged peek at the factional warfare the developers are promising, which will see corpo jerks and syndicate scum clash "in an endless fight for territorial control of the Alpha Centauri star system."  </p>
<p>What this looks like in practice is a lot of diving and ducking and blasting off limbs. Miniguns, sniper rifles, thermal goggles, VTOL aircrafts, weird dudes commanding legions of insectoid horrors. What's not to like? Just look at that dithering. I could run my finger across the screen and it would feel like a tea strainer. Ah, beautiful.</p>

<p>The game also plans to include a lot of other features, going beyond the firefights we see here. There are promises of survival mechanics that require you to eat, drink, and sleep. As well as the possibility of buying and selling goods (and even stocks) in a "player-driven" economy. Not to mention the spaceship tinkering.

</p><p>"Become an engineer repairing starships, a mech pilot commanding war machines, to a syndicate leader, executing raids deep within a labyrinthic neon city," say Rotoscope. "Trade products through physical shops on the streets to digital securities on the Centauri Exchange. Build spacecraft with complex sub-systems such as power grids, server networks, and life support systems to keep your crew alive in deep space..."</p>
<p>These are big promises for what looks like a small studio. Even one of these many features would constitute an entire game's worth of work. I'm also conscious of what happened last time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-mommy-mechs-of-the-forever-winter-are-stomping-into-early-access-next-month">expelled litres of drool</a> over an apocalyptic mech-stomped warzone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">much jankier than I'd hoped</a> (although to be fair it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winters-water-will-no-longer-drain-away-while-youre-offline">getting reliably updated</a> as its own early access continues). But never mind that. I am the mech appreciator. I live in a rusty state of eternal hope. I'll keep you informed of Beta Decay's progress.</p>
