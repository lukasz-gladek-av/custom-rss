            <p>
You knew it was coming, I knew it was coming, and now one Mr. Hideo Kojima himself (disclaimer: technically it was Sony during tonight's State of Play, though I'm sure he's Fweeted about it on Fwitter) has confirmed that yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is making its way to PC. It's also doing so pretty soon, and with a small suite of additional features not present in its original PS5 release.
</p>
<p>
For starters, that release date: it's March 19th! That's a little over a month away, and less than a year after it first launched, so, not a horrendously long wait all things considered. Those features unique to PC are pretty much exactly what you'd expect with things like ultrawide monitor support, in both 21:9 UltraWidescreen, and 32:9 Super UltraWidescreen, and 4K resolution.

There's also the option for uncapped framerates, obviously depending on your PC specs, or upscaling and frame generation if that's more your speed. And if you've got a DualSense controller, there's full support for that too, or you can use your mouse and keyboard if you're that committed to that kind of life. Over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/">PlayStation Blog</a> it was also confirmed that some new modes will be coming "that will offer players new challenges and rewards." Your guess is as good as mine as to what those could be, but they'll be coming at launch in any case, with details coming next month.
</p><p>
If you've not already played this one on PS5 yet, it honestly is just more of the same of the first game, but this time in Australia, with a few bells, whistles, gadgets, and gizmos thrown on top. I'm not one to heap praise upon Kojima needlessly, guy's got a cushy enough life, but from what I've played of it, just walking around beautiful, endless deserts, mountainscapes, and all sorts does have a certain something to it. Though, there is a touch too much shooting compared to the first game for my liking.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you can already wishlist Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3280350/DEATH_STRANDING_2_ON_THE_BEACH/">Steam</a> ahead of its release next month.
