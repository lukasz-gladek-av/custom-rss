            <p>Two very good skating games are back up for sale on Steam after disappearing for four months. Bright 'n' cheery skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and dystopian rollerskate shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-have-been-de-listed-from-steam-and-nobody-knows-why">vanished in a cloud of toxic corporate smoke</a> in February this year, some time after the closure of the games' developers Roll7. But it looks like the poisonous fumes have finally cleared, and the games are once again available.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not clear why the games have been absent. But it is very likely the result of legal and business hullabaloo caused by parent company Take-Two Interactive last year. Come with me now on a dollar-burning trip through the wastes of global financial malignancy, as I tell a tale as old and stupid as time.</p>
<p>The original developers of the games, Roll7, were owned by publishers Private Division, who were in turn owned by merciless corpocolossus Take-Two Interactive. In May last year Private Division were sold off by their business daddy to a private equity firm, and the studio who actually made good games, Roll7, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">unceremoniously shut down</a> as a result. The CEO of Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">tried to deny this</a>, but the effect on workers at both Roll7 and other Private Division studios (like the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> developers) was clear. They were all laid off. </p>
<p>It's a disappointing, if familiar, tale. But the delisting of the games months after the sale and their reappearance this week is a weird afterword. On the Steam page for both games, 2K (Take-Two's publishing moniker) are now listed as publisher. At the time of the sale, Take-Two said they were including all of Private Divisions "live and unreleased" games. But they now claim otherwise. 2K has "confirmed that neither Rollerdrome nor OlliOlli World were included in the Private Division sale, and that it is now the publisher of both games," according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-are-back-on-steam-after-being-delisted-4-months-ago-when-2k-sold-off-private-division/">PC Gamer</a>. Weird. </p>
<p>Whatever the dumbass legal reason that caused the games to disappear, it appears to be solved. Now you enter the realm of minor ethical dilemma: buy the games because they are excellent, or ignore them completely because the company who stands to profit fired everyone who worked on said bangers? Of course, other skulduggery is possible, as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kimhu.bsky.social/post/3kztixxrogd26">at least two people</a> who worked on the game. Do whatever you like, I can't tell you what's right. What do I know? I'm just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood">the 21st best player of OlliOlli 2</a> (on PlayStation 4). </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Reader, I'm getting some serious de ja vu from the the poster for <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">Liberation Escape Rooms</a> 'Castle Of Conundrums' experience, but I'm having trouble placing it. I don't <em>think</em> I've been to this escape room before, never having visited the town of Southaven, Mississippi. Perhaps I should go? The <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">reviews are</a> positively glowing. "Very exciting and unique escape rooms," writes Anna R. Five stars! "Today's game in the Castle just blew us away," enthuses Tracey S. Five stars again! An unmissable experience by all accounts. And yet, I'd feel woefully unequiped to take on the Castle Of Conundrums if I cannot solve the much more pressing conundrum at hand.</p>

<p>"The king and his knights are on a quest to protect the crown. While they are away, a new and formidable threat appears just beyond the castle walls," reads the lore blurb. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Worst possible time this could have happened. "Can you prove your worthiness in Merlinâ€™s trials, become a knight, and defend the kingdom?". Wait. What? Why is Merlin holding trials when the castle is in danger from a threat - need I remind you - that is <em>just beyond the castle walls</em>?! There's no time for your classic chicanery, Merlsy! We need knights <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A familiar set-up, no doubt. But no, no. That's not it. There's something <em>else</em> familiar about the poster for Liberation Escape Rooms Presents The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5. Why, it's that plaque in the top left, isn't it? The breastplate. The crossed swords. Why, that's definitely Dark Knight Armoury's <a href="https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/product/heraldic-eagle-breastplate-with-two-decorative-swords-wall-plaque/">Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque</a>! The only problem is that I've never laid eyes on Dark Knight Armoury's Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque, so it must be something else.</p>
<p>"We have done a handful of escape rooms in the Memphis area and this was by far one of the best!!!!!" writes Alicia B. Five stars again! Can you not see the subterfuge occurring right before your eyes, Alicia? You and your other five star compatriots? Are you so swayed by Liberation Escape Rooms' - by all accounts - unbeatable customer service that you've willingly blinded yourself to the lies contained in the poster for The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5? Is it left solely to me to unpack its uncanny familiarity; the sole possessor of open eyes in a land where gummy-lidded herds chew mindlessly on opiatic cud like newborn foals?</p>
<p>Hang on. Hang on. It's the bloody font, isn't it? Classic <a href="https://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/bluebeard/">bluebeard</a>. I'd recognise you anywhere. Phew.</p>

            <p>â€œThe lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne," wrote Chaucer. But you'd trained hard with that crossbow, and let any man in bolting distance try to claim you hadn't mastered it. You never wanted to go to war, but the crops were failing, you'd just lost your seventeenth child to medium-pox, and dark portents swirled on the horizon like curdled goat's milk. Also, the actual goat's milk was curdling.</p>
<p>In that tent, you'd communed with angels, and the righteous fury of all the heavens coursed through every fibre of your being. You'd likely die today, you knew. But you'd die knowing you did all you could to put this fair kingdom to rights. You step outside, breathe deep the morning air, and immediately eat a point blank pump-action shotgun to the torso. Then you lose both your legs to the tank shell. Then someone runs over your corpse with a dirtbike. Bloody typical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> made memeish waves when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">first teased last February</a>, and while it'd be easy to write it off as just a one-note joke based on an inherently goofy power imbalance (you have guns and tanks, they have swords and horses), there does look to be a bit more occurring here. It's a four-player co-op action game where you'll be also able to command armies a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a>, and build fortifications on the fly a la, uh, Fortnite I guess. I estimate the simple joys of shotgun vs pikeman will last for about forty minutes, but assuming the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> layer holds up, I'm still very much into this.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on the single-save honour mode, and Kingmakers looks to have its own honour mode of sorts, too, should you fancy it. As mentioned in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2109770/discussions/0/4340977379955918858/">dev Q&amp;A</a>, you'll be able to use a sword and shield, so it sounds like you can theoretically ignore the helicopters and grenade launchers and just get stuck in the melee. I'm not sure why you would, mind. Honour is for chumps that didn't bring enough helicopters. Kingmakers releases in early access October 8th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this week, one of my industry peers James Bentley (they're over at that other site about PC games, GamerPCs I think it's called) put out a video essay titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/KtqrklovNHI?si=niPEfgfN3OxDxMmF">I Can Guarantee You This Game is Going to be Underrated</a>". Trusting in James as a critic of varied and interesting taste, I clicked through and found that yeah, they're right, it probably will be. However, I also get to write about indie PC games for a living, so I'd like to do my part in telling you about this strange, point-and-click/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/decade">Decade</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I don't think Decade is an easy, or perhaps comfortable game to describe, given its heavy themes. The game follows four children, specifically the four last children on the entire planet, the only survivors after metallic rain killing almost everyone else, the rest of them subsequently killing each other. Somehow these kids manage to get a time machine working, with three of them able to travel back 10 years to try and save the world.

<p>
The thing is, time travel or not, aging comes for us all, and these children do in fact grow older across those 10 years. While in the past, they can "investigate documents, technologies, and artefacts to understand history", all the while trying to make decisions that can lead you into several different futures. This, to put it plainly, is a concept that will likely continue to keep me up at night.
</p>
<p>
How much guilt should I feel for leading these children towards a future that might not even be liveable? Will I waste their years away in doing so? Do they get to have a future? These are questions I'm yet to answer myself through playing the game, but I'd like to, and it would be nice if you were interested in trying to do the same.
</p>
<p>
Developer Last Piscean worked on this solo after losing their job, and they still haven't managed to find one, and with the game releasing today (with a discount that makes it the price of two cups of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3272360/Decade/">Steam</a>), there's no better time to check it out than now.
