            <p>Time to phone Genghis Khan. Tell him the news. There's gonna be a bit more waiting before you can become 13th century Mongolia's a truest Yam courier rider/horse befriender. Following its latest Steam Next Fest demo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">The Legend of Khiimori</a>'s early access release has been pushed back to March next year.</p>
<p>I know, throw down your spurs like they're Yosemite Sam's hat. There's neigh way developers Aesir Interactive and NightinGames have done this to you. Well, they have, but they say they've got the game's best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The equine delivery sim's now set to emerge from early access on March 3rd, 2026, its developers have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2697000/view/519727718097487890?l=english">announced</a>. "The wonderful reception during Steam Next Fest has led to us sitting down with our publisher and together we have decided to take more time to create a more feature and content-rich experience," they wrote. "While this does mean that you all have to wait a little longer to get your hands on Khiimori, it also means weâ€™ll be able to make sure you get a better game when we do release into Early Access."</p><p>Alongside fleshing Khiimori out with extra features, Aesir say their "main priorities" include improving "player guidance and world experience", as well as the camera, controls, and interface. They also plan to make some performance tweaks to help the game run a bit more smoothly and lower its fairly lofty minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>To help tide the bronco busters of the Steam corral over, the game's Next Fest demo has stuck around past the conclusion of the great demopocalypse and won't disappear until November 30th. So, if like me you've not had a chance to give it a go yet, there's an extra month or so to find a saddle.</p>
<p>I am keen to try it, though, despite not being a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> enjoyer. There's something in its description of breeding and caring for a steed as you negotiate delivery routes you've plotted out, occasionally stopping to forage or shoot a thing with your bow, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s wilderness-wandering. Or, like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> with mares instead of Mack lorries.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find The Legend of Khiimori's lingering demo if you gallop over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697000/The_Legend_of_Khiimori/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <p>
For a myriad of reasons, I can't really write any particular profane curse words here, but an approximation of my feelings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdcage">Birdcage</a>, an anime as hell, "sword action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> game", it would be something like, "this game is so ******* sick, like what the ****, how the **** can one game be so ******* stylish." I'm sure you can fill in the blanks of what words I wish I could use there, but if you'll allow me, I'd also like to take the time to actually talk about why Birdcage rules so much.
</p>
<p>
Birdcage is an upcoming title from Polygon Bird Games, which consists of just two people: Giannis Milonogiannis, a comic book artist who's worked with big dogs like DC and Marvel, and Barry Topping, the composer behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-killer">Paradise Killer</a>. Milonogiannis is behind all the art from the game, which is just a perfect concoction of moods and influences, coming through tightly in its recently released demo (<strong><em>big flashing lights warning</em></strong>).

<p>
Inspired by '90s arcade games, Birdcage's opening cutscenes feel just as sparse yet tantalising as the best of them. You are the pilot of a ship called the Halycon, with one goal in mind: destroy a new kind of weapon that will "end Earth's reign and birth a new universe, the World-Egg." This is delivered to you in single screen scenes with art that evokes the best JRPG classics - think a sketchier, more pixel arty Breath of Fire 4 cover kind of vibe.
</p><p>
It's the kind of game you can imagine getting an OVA straight-to-VHS adaptation that's worth $300 now and has not been released in high quality, so your only way to watch it is through a crappy rip uploaded to the Internet Archive. The story in the demo is minimal, and there's only six stages apparently, but the restraint exercised makes me curious for more, the best kind of narrative.
</p>
<p>
With your ship, you have a few combat options. You can shoot out a spread of bullets that do less damage but hit more enemies, or you can concentrate them to do more damage, the tradeoff being that you move slower (which turns into a boon in more bullet laden levels). Said ship also has a sword, a point that rules an incredible amount, that can destroy certain bullet types, can be swung around to damage certain ships, or shot out at an enemy. It's all mostly simple, yet tough as hell. You've only got three bits of health, and limited lives, so dodging every bullet is a lot more stressful than you'd think.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's an arcade mode which is just story mode without the story, and score attack where enemies infinitely spawn within a set time limit as you try to rack up some points. Real classic arcade stuff.
</p>
<p>
You can try out the demo for yourself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158550/BIRDCAGE/">Steam</a> right now, or alternatively, you can wait until November 18th for the full release.
