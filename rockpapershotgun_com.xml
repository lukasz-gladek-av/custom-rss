            <p>Morning all! The working week once again looms above us like a bulldozer driven by raucous and somehow loveable sheepdogs in top hats and cufflinks. Quickly now, lob a few new PC game releases under the caterpillar treads to slow its passage. It's not clear where those sheepdogs are going, but your and my wellbeing are clearly of secondary importance.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 14th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about factory games, apparently. My highlights among the mass producers are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kaizen-a-factory-story">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a>, a craftsmanlike automation puzzler from former Zachtronics devs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3320980/MoteMancer/">MoteMancer</a>, in which you build fantastical factories in different dimensions that overlap in real-time. Note: the MoteMancer devs have said that genAI was used to "ideate" the art, though the final art assets were created by regular humans - or "skinloads" as we are known in the trade.</li>
<li>If you despise factories, please take your resentments to the tiles of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040170/Arashi_Gaiden/">Arashi Gaiden</a>, a turn-based ninja slicer. Where is my ninja factory sim, games industry.
</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 15th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is all about comebacks of one kind or another. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</a> is Aspyr Media's revamping of one of the D&amp;D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> people venerated before "D&amp;D RPG" became synonymous with "Baldur's Gate 3".</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3024040/Stronghold_Crusader_Definitive_Edition/">Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition</a> is Firefly's remastering of 2002's answer to Angry Birds.</li>
<li>Troubled Bungie FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has a new edition and DLC rollout - Year Of Prophecy. The first of the new DLC packs is The Edge Of Fate, which includes a new planet featuring lost humans and forgotten Fallen houses.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is today's token Actual New Game. It's a pleasantly cracked real-time tactics roguelite in which you try to get yourself canonised before you are martyred.
</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 16th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, it is time to exsanguinate Pikmin and daub gory geometry in occult squad tactics puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, which should remind you instantly of Cult Of The Lamb.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 17th July</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">The Necromancer's Tale</a> (pictured) is an open world RPG with Disco Elysium-esque dialogue windows in which you are a questing liche (quiche?), building up your rotten retinue (rotinue? Let's go with it) while going to the occasional ball.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3343160/Fill_Up_The_Hole/">Fill Up The Hole</a> is a chirpy 2D landfill empire simulator. Can't spell wholesome without hole, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> attempts to make a horror game out of Pac-Man, overlooking that Pac-Man is already perfectly horrible. Pac-Man, a game in which you are an insatiable orb in a maze of ghosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-drifter">The Drifter</a> could be this week's highlight. It's a pulp adventure joint inspired by "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse", in which you a homeless man asked to investigate his own murder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 18th July</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you enjoy besieging Rainbows? Do you enjoy kicking doors? Have some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841770/Phantom_Squad/">Phantom Squad</a>, then.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are we denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, Nic and Jeremy spent a lot of this week's all-hands meeting complaining about gardening - possibly gardening in a video game. I can't quite remember, because I was myself too busy complaining about the 1990s. Possibly the 1990s in a videogame - again, I can't quite remember. This happens a lot at the minute. </p>
<p>Mark has some embargoed stuff on the boil, and James is just back from break, freshly bronzed and hungry for words. Ollie is tidying up some bits and pieces before he, too, embarks on holiday. Graham is staring at us all patiently from the corner of the video call, waiting for people to shut up about their roots. What are you up to this week? Assuming you haven't been smooshed by sheepdogs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-stronghold-destiny-and-neverwinter-nights-lead-a-host-of-drifters-necromancers-and-pac-monsters]]></content:encoded>

        <p>The future should bring even more complex randomness shenanigans</p>

            <p>It's time. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s gotten a randomiser mod, just in case the base game isn't quite maxing out your unexpected chaos-per-run meter at this point, despite its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-hero-for-our-times-elden-ring-nightreign-boss-becomes-unbeatable-by-refusing-to-show-up">revamped bosses</a>.</p>
<p>While FromSoft's roguelike-ish twist on the established souls formula already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">switches things up</a> in a manner that's a bit like a randomiser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-mods">mod</a> makeover of one of the series' traditional entries, modder thefifthmatt has still found ways to tinker with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/277?tab=description">Nightreign randomiser and derandomiser</a>, which can be used to scramble map layouts beyond what's possible in the base game, which has a finite range of different map patterns it can chuck at you per Nightlord. It's a first foray into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> randomising that the author says will serve as a "basis for more advanced randomisation" down the line.</p>
<p>"At a base level, the only difference you might notice using the randomizer is that Night Bosses are more varied for a given Nightlord," thefifthmatt wrote. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements. In the future this can be extended to randomising enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customisation."</p>
<p>The randomiser works by modifying files when you start up the game, and comes with three distinct randomness presets, "similar to base game", "balanced random", "extra random". They all basically do what they say on the tin, with "balanced" looking like the one you'll want to try first, while "extra" ditches some "placement restrictions which are normally helpful for balancing purposes" to make things tougher for uber-hardcore folks.</p>
<p>You can also pick "any custom combination of these options or other options like greatly increasing the frequency of double Night Bosses". Plus, thefifthmatt's chucked in extra options like increasing the chance of shifting earth being a factor or reverting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-its-first-patch-but-more-importantly-a-trailer-thatll-really-help-you-wake-up">patch 1.01's tweaks</a> to runes and revives so uber-sweaty solo players can wind back the clock to a time of enhanced hardness.</p>
<p>Not every aspect of the maps has been made randomness-eligible yet, but as the modder says, it's a start, and one that's compatible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">Nightreign's Seamless Co-op mod</a> so you can dive in with however many buddies you like. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab <a href="https://me3.help/en/latest/">Mod Engine 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-inevitable-randomiser-mod-is-here-to-spice-up-your-runs-with-extra-funky-map-scrambling]]></content:encoded>

<p>Relic have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: ReDawned: War For All: Come Get Some War Down Ya: One Dawntillion Wardollars Edition will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods". Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War: This Dawn, Its Warsenal Edition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">also comes bundled with all four expansions</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the full package contains four campaigns and nine factions, namely Orks, Eldar, Spicy Eldar, Space Marines, Spicy Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tau, Necrons, and Sisters Of Battle. Tyranids were never released, but you have to remember this was 2004, and the idea of having a swarming species of hive-minded purple bug aliens in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> was ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of multiplayer, Relic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">say they've</a> been "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs", though balance will remain the same. They also plan to hang around for a bit after launch to fix "high priority issues", and experiment with with changes to things like flying unit behaviour, unit pathing, and "quality-of-life settings such as grid key presets".</p>
<p>As for general improvements, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of Phwoar, That's A Lot Of War(hammer) edition features: image-based lighting, unit texture upscaling ("at least four times their original resolution), new world lighting, unit reflections, surface gloss, emissive lighting, and new shadows. There's also an integrated mod manager, an "improved camera", better draw distances, 4K support, and a better HUD for widescreen.</p>
<p>There is apparently a very minor controversy going on over the new trailer (above) replacing a Space Marine's scream. The word 'iconic' has been used. This does not bother me, because everything that has ever come out of a Space Marine's mouth is stupid, and the setting would be vastly improved if you replaced it all with goat noises. Although, as an Ork enjoyer, I realise I'm throwing stones from the glassiest of houses here.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-gets-an-august-release-date-with-a-chunky-discount-for-anniversary-owners]]></content:encoded>
