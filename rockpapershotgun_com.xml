            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> is a "Slow Life <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" in which you live out 14 different lives in... hold on, record scratch and/or Gru's Plan fourth panel - let me run that premise by myself again. I have to live 14 different lives? How is that "slow"? I have a hard enough time keeping up with one life in the amateurishly designed role-playing game we call reality, with its saddening shortage of rideable dragons.</p>
<p>Ah, but of course developers Level-5 are merely being cute with their framing. By "lives" they really mean classes or character jobs. In this blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> boglin basher and island town-builder, you will switch lives like you're, well, exactly like you're putting on different coats and hats, going by the trailer. Those 14 lives are split between three self-explanatory categories: under Gathering Lives we find farming and fishing, while Crafting Lives include blacksmithing, alchemy and such, and Combat Lives are all about ending them.</p><!--more-->

The game launches this week, as detailed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/">Steam</a>. We haven't covered it before, and I'm not aware that anybody currently employed at the Treehouse has played the previous instalment on 3DS. I do, however, have many fond memories of Level-5's older RPGs - Dark Cloud and Chronicle, Ni no Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch, and let's not forget <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> VIII. Still the Dragon Quest to beat, for my onions. Professor Layton? I'm afraid I don't know him. Did they consult with him on Jeanne D'Arc?
</p><p>In any case, Fantasy Life i seems as bright and burgeoning and basically happy to exist as any of those games - so chipper and sparkling that I'm willing to forgo murdering the studio leadership for putting that lowercase "i" in the title.</p>
<p>The premise is that you're part of an archaeological expedition who discover bits of fossilised dragon on an island. In the process, you also find a portal to the distant past that allows you to unravel the mystery of the island's downfall.</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, you will alternate between roaming the monster-addled continents of yore and terraforming the island in the present, adding houses and decorations and terrain fixtures such as rivers. It's an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> game with its foot stuck in Dragon Quest Heroes. There is talk of saving the world, but it sounds like that comes a very distant second to choosing the wallpaper.</p>
<p>Look out for the game on 21st May. Given the multiple Lives framing, the obvious thing it's missing is an introspective spiral akin to the tawdry soap opera that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, in which one man clones himself in order to operate a huge rolling spacebase. If I actually had 14 different lives at my disposal, I guarantee you there would be a pecking order with the Cook at the top of it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
