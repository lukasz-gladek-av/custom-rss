            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">My review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> begins with a retelling of the first unexpected curveball the RPG threw my way. Barely out of the intro and having made exactly two vending machine purchases, I was offered the consumerism flaw. This puzzled me. As it turns out, this event had good reason to puzzle me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, since the game emerged into early access late last week - a time frame during which only those who spunked around £30 extra for the game's preorder premium edition can play it - other folks have run into this flaw, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-dunks-on-you-with-a-consumerism-flaw-that-secretly-makes-you-stupid-if-you-bought-its-usd100-version-for-early-access-promotions-and-sales-have-riddled-your-brain/">assumed that it must be dunking on them</a> for having bought that more expensive edition.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense, and honestly I'm a bit narked with myself for not making the connection immediately. In my defense, the flaw isn't listed among the extra bits offered by the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-outer-worlds-2-preorder-premium-edition/9P65228JL613/0010/B1G720SRQH3P">premium edition</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">storefronts</a> as far as I can tell. Nor is it explicity labelled with the words 'premium' or 'deluxe', as the corporate appreciation premium pack moon man gear which has been hanging out in my inventory all 40 or so hours is. So, since my character was given dialogue which suggested them to simply be very dumb due to my accepting of this flaw designed to make fun of my superfluous spending, I guess you got me, Outer Worlds 2. Touché, Obsidian. Well played.</p>
<p>But, wait just one second. If the flaw's designed as a fun little Borderlandsy meta dunk on premium edition purchasers, it's taken on rather a different meaning in this case. You see, as is usually the case with reviews outside of instances in which companies decide not to send out codes for whatever reason, I was given an early copy of The Outer Worlds 2's all-singing, all-dancing premium edition for free by publishers Microsoft. We certainly didn't specify an edition we wanted, so as often happens it was the publishers' understandable decision to send me, a person who'd be critiquing the game and publishing thoughts, the swankiest version of it.</p><p>In 99% of cases, that boring behind-the-scenes admin wouldn't be something worth telling you about, but in this one, it's created a set of circumstances which have turned Obsidian's joke totally on its head and into something I honestly find a fair bit funnier. I promise that isn't just because quirks of fate mean it's not ended up a gag at my expense, either. I love a joke, be they good, bad, or indifferent. As long as the circumstances/company are appropriate, I'm generally in favour of firing away the funnies, even if they're tortured punchlines doomed to fall flat.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Obsidian / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something uniquely hilarious about this one. A studio who, whether at their own behest or under duress from their corporate overlords, are doing a swanky premium edition offering the chance to play early and having a little laugh about people, er, buying that thing they're selling. Then it inadvertently pings right back around. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDo6g4CCeU">this Faith No More cover</a> I'm fond of. After all, even if my position as a journo who hadn't bought the thing wasn't anticipated, what about folks who might get the premium edition free through the likes of competitions or just wait until sales eventually render it cheaper than the standard edition of the game is at launch?</p>
<p>I know, I'm giving far too much thought to the ramificiations of this harmless and fun little gag, but having realised what's happened, I can't help but feel it rather sums up the Outer Worlds 2 experience in a way I hadn't intended. Instead of a scenario with promise of something that could be New Vegas-level great, but to me ends up feeling closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>-level good, you get something skewered by reality into a version of itself that doesn't quite match what was anticipated or hoped. It's a lot like many of the lines uttered in jest and parody by the conniving corporatists of Auntie's Choice sounding akin to something you might find in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">very real layoff memo</a> or <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">marketing pitch</a> from Obsidian's parent company Microsoft.</p><p>Folks might well still laugh if your jokes are funny or self-aware enough, but it's a lot more difficult to satirise or mock something if you're part of it, without risking those efforts ringing a bit hollow. Especially if you're deliberately working a lot of your wink wink, nudge nudge corporate spoofing into the more expensive edition of a product you're trying to sell.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale mode REDSEC is out now, a "genre shifting free-to-play destination" that includes both the promised Fortnite functionality and a new squad-based competitive mode, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> - no, not that Gauntlet, auto-keyword tool, stop it, you're making me look daft, UGH I don't have time to argue with you, please just go away - together with additional gubbins for Battlefield's Portal editor. You can find it either via your Battlefield 6 install or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/">as a separate release on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
REDSEC's battle royale map is Fort Lyndon, pictured below, with takes place in the backyards and beaches of California, and is apparently the series' biggest map ever. The setup is familiar: 100 players divided into squads are dropped into the world and must scrounge for pick-ups and do shooticuffs and fistibangs within a shrinking (and partly destructible) playspace.

<p>
As for the Gauntlet mode, this is a tournament affair in which eight teams of four compete in round-based missions, with each round giving you five minutes to complete an objective. Each round, map and mission has different variables.
</p>
<p>
What, you think all of that sounds rubbish? Hie thee to the Battlefield Portal editor, then, where you can rip REDSEC's skin off and fiddle around with various parameters. The developers give the example of restricting everybody to sledgehammers or making use of scripting tools to put together more bespoke chains of events and objectives.

REDSEC - or Redsec, as it shall be known from this point on, because I am weary of bellowing at you through my keyboard - launches alongside the first season of Battlefield 6's live service offerings, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">read about here</a>. I'm not much of a battle royaler, certainly nowhere near as battleregal as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Aphid Leggings</a> enthusiast James, but I'll try to get a game going later and let you know how I fare.

"Hold my beer," interjected <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse, before diving into a flyblown burlap sack and fishing out the press release for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood-2">Darkwood 2</a>. Did you ever play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a>? It's the survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about being a hermit in a horrible, horrible, top-down forest. It's the game that persuaded Adam Smith to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-wicked-and-the-weird-darkwood-impressions">mercy-kill his dog</a>. The new one is set in "the scorched deserts of a dying sea" that is slowly being engulfed by evil trees. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>This dramatic change of setting isn't even the most startling thing about the game. Nor is the fact that Hooded Horse, hitherto known for banger <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy games</a>, are publishing it. No, the most surprising thing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> is that it's being developed by Ice-Pick Lodge, developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a>, with original Polish creators Acid Wizard monitoring the production from afar like lurking creatures in the underbrush.

<p>Pathologic and Darkwood are, I think, neck and neck for the title of Video Game Most Likely To Actually Give You The Plague. Asking the makers of one to make a sequel to the other is like, I don't know, putting Jack the Ripper in charge of the Manhattan Project. To top it all off, the key art reminds me of the main menu art for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. Truly, this is a videogame tailored to my tastes, though I do have some concerns about Ice-Pick Lodge's ability to craft a top-down horror game and also, how they're faring following the departure of their co-founder amid allegations of kidnapping.
</p><p>Darkwood 2 is set amid the dry salvages of a real-life body of water, the Aral Sea. Lying between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, it used to be the third largest lake in the world at 68,000 square kilometres, but began shrinking in the 1960s after rivers were diverted to Soviet irrigation projects.</p>
<p>Today, it's largely toxic dust, though there have been attempts to replenish the waters. Darkwood 2 takes place in the 1990s. Assuming the game sticks to real-life history, that would be following the abandonment of Soviet Russian efforts to restore the lake by way of a massive canal system, and in the midst of a phase of irrigation system building over in newly post-Soviet Uzbekistan. All that's according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea#History">Wikipedia</a>, anyway - if you happen to be a proper historian of the Aral Sea, I'd appreciate your input on the screenshots and trailer.
</p>
<p>As for how it plays, Darkwood 2 looks to be treading squarely in its predecessor's stinking, gore-filled bootprints. It's a foetid real-time exploration and scavenging sim in which visibility is swallowed and splintered by encroaching trunks. It's still about scraping together resources and fortifying a lair with barricades and traps, before the sun goes down and the real monsters come out. But there are new monsters to discover - hark at that giga-catfish in the footage - and there are "new reasons to pray for the morning light". Set a few years later, the game seems to build on the events of Darkwood, but Hooded Horse assure us that it can be treated as a standalone story.

<p>There are marshes to squelch through, meandering paths amid dunes, and deep waters to row over (I would probably row quite fast). There shall be no quest markers or waypoints, none of your modern cartographical frippery, only the madness and desperation of local humans fighting to keep the invading trunks at bay.
</p><p>All this appetising misery notwithstanding, returning players may have misgivings about the departure of original developers Acid Wizard. The first game's creators <a href="https://x.com/TheAcidWizard/status/1688551878974398464?s=20">suspended operations indefinitely in 2022</a>, after failing "to create a work environment that would not be destructive to our personal lives". They had struggled to find an audience for their follow-up project, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-studio-behind-darkwood-are-making-turn-based-tactical-football-and-you-can-try-it-free-now">jarringly upbeat football game Soccer Kids</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Crafting the world of Darkwood was a very challenging and long journey for the team," Acid Wizard co-founder Gustaw Stachaszewski comments in a press release for Darkwood 2. "After an experience like that, you become emotionally attached to your work. We know that the fans have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of Darkwood. For years, the idea of handing over our baby to another studio was something unthinkable for us. But, after it became evident that working together is not viable anymore, we decided that Darkwood should live on, even if not directly through our work.
</p>
<p>"We're genuinely excited to pass on the torch to Ice-Pick Lodge - creators whose work on Pathologic has inspired us for years," Stachaszewski goes on. "The team at IPL really gets what makes Darkwood a unique experience. We believe they will not only honor its spirit but will create something truly exceptional. As for us, we'll be in the background, making sure it stays true to the original vision."
</p>
<p>In the same release, Ice-Pick Lodge's executive producer Alexander Souslov has some additional thoughts for people who might question the blend of developer and publisher here - again, Hooded Horse are better known for city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> and 4X than spooks and squalor. "I believe the most interesting things are created when people with very different backgrounds work together on creative projects," he observes. "Ice-Pick is known for its focus on narrative and on the design of semiotic systems. Hooded Horse, on the other hand, is renowned for its expertise in strategy. What kind of game could come from that?"

<p>Ice-Pick Lodge have been on a complicated journey of their own, these past few years. The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">announced Pathologic 3 in October 2024</a>. Due for release in January 2026, it includes story materials and other elements that were once supposed to be part of Pathologic 2. There was a certain amount of frission over this and the dropping of the original game's open world elements, with our own Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">commenting of one demo</a> that it felt simultaneously designed for and designed to annoy returning Pathologic players.
</p><p>Then, in March this year, founder Nikolay Dybowski suddenly <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">left the studio</a> after Pathologic players discovered that he had been accused of kidnapping and abuse, with allegations dating back to 2021. Former Ice-Pick developer Aleksey Luchin responded to these reports, branding Dybowski a "manipulative sociopath that is very good with words." I've asked Hooded Horse and Ice-Pick if they'd like to offer any further comment on Dybowski's departure. More positively, Ice-Pick Lodge were among the first Russian developers to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathologic/comments/t3e0es/ipl_statement_regarding_recent_events/">speak out</a> against their country's invasion of Ukraine, telling social media followers that "a crime is being committed in our name. This is not only a crime against our friends. It is a crime against our dignity."

We never reviewed it, but Darkwood appears nonetheless on our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">the best horror games on PC</a>. Here's hoping Ice-Pick Lodge can do it justice.</p>
