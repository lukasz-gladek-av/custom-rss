Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-promise-they-wont-force-everybody-to-do-a-face-scan-following-outrage-at-new-age-verification-policy">assured us earlier</a> that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <p>"You will get anywhere between a fairly surgical battle with the more simple moves and synergies, to a downright-drunken-disaster run. [They] act with basically zero understanding of enemy mechanics, no regard for their ability order, and they couldn't give less of a damn about tile hazards." This is a section taken from the description of a mod which turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> into an auto-battler, but turning the controls over to an AI chessmaster. That AI chessmaster just happens to play almost exactly like I have in my seven hours with it thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Seriously, modder Bigbrotherjakeb appears to have found a way to clone me out of sheer desire not to have to play Mewgenics' fights themselves. Their creation, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/8">Auto-Battler Mode</a>', applies the Uncontrollable passive to all of the cats in your party. So, the computer will handle moving them about, targeting enemies, and unleashing abilities. Not that it'll do a good job of any of that. "This is effectively a challenge mode with how dumb the default player AI can be with this implementation (simplest I could quickly find)," the modder wrote.</p>
<p>Cool. Bigbrotherjakeb has hopes of teaching the stupid computer how to pick suitable movement strategies based on the specific class of cat it's controlling in future. I should probably get around to master the same thing.</p>
<p>A couple of other early Mewgenics mods which've caught my eye are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/24?tab=description">Less Cats</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/32">good poop</a>'. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the first one actually results in you having more cats by lowering the number of moggies the game's coterie of weirdos ask for in return for upgrades. As someone who's been a bit sad to part with my retired bois not long after they return from their sole adventure, that sounds good to me.</p><p>Good poop, meanwhile, leaves no room for misinterpretation. Poop now adds two pints to both your cats' health and comfort, rather than dragging it down by the same amount. A relatively small tweak, unless you find a way to play in smellivision further down the road, in which case you might get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the auto-battler mode or less cats a go, both require the Mewgenics Mod Manager dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/1">Mewtator</a>.</p>
<p>Also among the roguelike cat breeder's early mods are a couple which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/29?tab=description">swap around the audio files</a> for in-game meows. This follows criticism directed at the decision of developer Edmund McMillen to include meows voiced by internet personalities such as Ethan and Hila Klein. You can read McMillen's response as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate">our report on the topic</a>.</p>
