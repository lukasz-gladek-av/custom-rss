Telltale Games obviously found a lot of success with its take on The Walking Dead, alongside several other series, but that whole episodic release thing never quite caught on. Even still, some former Telltale Games devs are clearly keen on trying it out again anyway. These devs are called AdHoc Studio, and their game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, a comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game about managing superheroes, which just got a release date (dates?) today.
</p>
<p>
The first two episodes arrive October 22nd, with two episodes releasing weekly after that point for a total of eight. "We think the release format is an underrated part of the player experience," AdHoc co-founder and Dispatch creative director Nick Herman said in a statement (cheers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-the-superhero-comedy-from-ex-telltale-devs-confirms-pc-ps5-release-date-and-episodic-release">IGN</a>). "Episodic is a format that makes the story easy to slip into, easy to keep up with, and easy to share with friends. We want the launch of Dispatch to be ‘appointment gaming’ but with the weekly cadence of a TV show, as opposed to asking people to wait months between each release."

I'm not quite sure I agree with that assessment that an episodic format makes it easy to keep up with. Weekly releases are the only good way to release a TV show, as it actually keeps people talking about it, but you're already likely to be either subscribed to a streaming service or pay for cable. So I'm not confident that Dispatch will fit into that kind of box so easily.
</p><p>
In any case, those TV show aspirations don't stop at the format. The voice cast not only includes names you've definitely heard the voices of somewhere like Laura Bailey and Matthew Mercer, but also Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and The Batman's Jeffrey Wright. There's also people like Jacksepticeye, Moistcr1tikal, and Yung Gravy. I will be making no further comments on those particular casting choices.

Our own Edwin did feel mostly positive about his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-demo-for-dispatch-the-invincible-style-superhero-comedy-from-former-wolf-among-us-writers">short time with the demo earlier this year</a>, but we'll find out how it actually shapes up when the first two episodes arrive October 22nd.
