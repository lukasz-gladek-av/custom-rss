            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)">Pogs</a> are something I never consciously think about until something reminds me of Pogs, at which time I am instantly very excited about Pogs. The latest reminder being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snow-town-geek-store">Snow Town Geek Store</a>, a shopkeeping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> brimming with 2000's non-tude. Like the 2000's themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:</p>

<p>"Here's the deal," begins the description. I think I could probably write several hundred words on what a deliberate and powerful choice it is to begin a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3225880/Snow_Town_Geek_Store/">Steam description</a> with the words "Here's the deal". But I'll save that for another time in which we are both dead and so neither of us has to listen to me. The description:</p>
<p>"It's the noughties, you work in a store of geek goods: games, mp3s, DVDs with movies and anime, gum, Cheetos, cigarettes, beer... Develop your store, communicate with customers (be friends, quarrel, cheat or flatter), get involved in shady dealings and earn your mom a trip to Hawaii."</p>
<p>The actual feature list has corresponding emojis which I can't recreate in this joyless husk of a content management system, but here are the features nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Order your favorite childhood goodies and put them on sale</li>
<li>Choices really matter - chat with customers, bargain, count the change and cheat!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your character's condition so you don't mess up (hunger, cold, rest - that's it)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Play pogs with your friends to build up your collection and play mini-games on the computer</li>
<li>Go out for a smoke and a piss, there's a lot of interesting things going on outside</li>
<li>Mom didn't teach you to ignore strange men? Then break the law to raise money faster.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I'm into this. Puns like having a Half Life 2 CD called "Whole Life 2" are obviously not a good use of gag real estate but, as I said, I like the energy. Developer Perelesoq previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568970/Torn_Away">Torn Away</a>, which won a whole bunch of awards for storytelling and the like. Snow Town Geek Store is out in "2025". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Could we perhaps chart the entire course of technological innovation as a story of things not fitting in other things quite as well as some reckless genius had hoped? Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/one-mad-modder-has-massacred-the-steam-deck-folding-it-into-a-steam-brick-with-no-screen-no-controller-and-absolutely-no-sense/?ut">PC Gamer</a>, one <a href="https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/">Crastinator-pro</a> has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“I am not a smart man," begins the disclaimer, before Crastinator-pro documents the process of transferring the innards of Valve's handheld into a custom case, played with a separate controller through a pair of AR glasses. The post is "not a guide, more of a 'how I did it'," they point out.</p>
<p>Their "first hurdle" was finding out whether the Deck would even boot without a screen or peripherals. Tutorials helped them disconnect everything from the motherboard excluding the fan, resulting in….(and I'm making space here out of fear my paraphrasing might rob the next part of its deserved sweet triumph):</p>
<p>"Success! In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock."</p>
<p>What follows is a lot of work that you're better off reading the full Github post for, but after tearing things down to a more compact internal frame, Crastinator-pro 3D printed a custom case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro -  "which should be heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>". The result is an attractive, ungodly brick with the following stats:</p>
<p>"About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter!"</p>
<p>"Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger!" is one of the listed FAQs. "Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place," writes Crastinator-pro. "More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it!"</p><p>I was immediately curious about Crastinator-pro's backpack, seemingly so precious that it warranted this diversion instead of just a simple replacement, but I realise now that this was the wrong question. I also understand the true weight behind his assertion that he is "not a smart man". The stifling prison of earthly intellect alone is not enough to inspire such works. Only sweet whispers from the ether could bestow the Blakean visions needed to conceive such a magnificent brick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"While the team has no plans for official in game mod support we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creations," Hamaguchi said previously. Speaking to Automaton, he followed up:</p>
<p>“As someone who plays games on PC, I sometimes use mods myself. I’m aware that mods have come to be accepted by the community and that they bring enjoyment to many players – I see it as a positive thing myself. I wasn’t trying to tell people not to use mods. It was more about being mindful. Both creators and users alike should ensure mods don’t detract from the intended game experience.”</p><p>“There are mods that could shock some players, so I encourage users to research what they’re installing and for creators to be mindful of their audience," he continued. “Mods have played a significant role in the rise of the PC market. Look at series like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a> or The Elder Scrolls – even years after release, new mods breathe life into these games, making players want to come back to them.”</p>
<p>“Volunteer communities often move faster than the companies that produced the source material, which creates an exciting atmosphere,” he finished. “I think It’s a fascinating market.”</p>
<p>I do often find it interesting how Nexus Mods can act as a window into player's wishlists for additional or alternative features closely following a game's release. Rebirth's Nexus Mods presence is currently mostly graphics mods like reshades or engine tweaks - which makes sense considering the issues <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-performance-best-settings">some are having</a> with the port.</p>
<p>There's, uh, also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/52">goth makeup</a> for Tifa. A secret <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/10/faq-do-you-know-what-health-goth-means.html">Health Goth</a> revival?</p>
<p>The developers of dino-em-up Code Violet recently drew attention by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dino-crisis-esque-horror-code-violet-wont-be-coming-to-pc-because-the-risk-of-vulgar-mods-isnt-worth-the-extra-money">announcing their game </a>won't be coming to PC because they don't want anyone "modding vulgar versions of the main character". Since then, they've also expressed <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1882873965187846185">concerns over piracy</a> as a major factor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
