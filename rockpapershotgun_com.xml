            <p>
Earlier this month, Discord said that they'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">rolling out a global age verification system</a> to which everyone and their mother responded by saying "thank you," except they didn't say thank. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-uk-discord-users-were-part-of-a-peter-thiel-linked-data-collection-experiment">A little bit later on</a>, they also shared word of an experiment being run in relation to this new system and policy that involved an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel called Persona, which apparently potentially stored any ID documentation you submitted to them for up to seven days. Now, after more and more pushback, Discord have put out a statement that still probably doesn't say what you wish it would.
</p>
<p>
For starters, the <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">statement</a> said that the chat service "should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works," and acknowledged that the age verification system didn't land particularly very well, though the buck stopped short of actually apologising. In fact, the post goes on to explain that Discord still plan to go ahead with introducing this system, but again stressed that "90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today."
</p>
<p>
They explain, "This is powered in part by our internal safety systems, which can already make an age determination for many adult users without any user action. We'll publish the methodology behind this in a technical blog post before we launch globally." For the remaining 10%, you will apparently be given options "designed to tell us only your age and never your identity." These include more verification options like doing so by submitting credit card options, though more alternatives will also be added.
</p>
<p>
It's also important to note that Discord say the test they ran with Persona was only "limited," and that after conducting it they've opted to not work with them after all, saying that "all data was deleted after completing verification. We’ve set a new bar for any partner offering facial age estimation, including that it must be performed entirely on-device, meaning your biometric data never leaves your phone. Persona did not meet that bar." Discord also committed to "full transparency on vendors" it works with, though ultimately, none of this is really the point, as people mostly just don't want to have to submit any kind of sensitive details at all just to talk about a bit of smut and the like with their friends.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, the global rollout of Discord's age verification system has been delayed to the latter half of 2026, so you've still got a while to mull over it all. What a polava.

            <p>
I think on the offset, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/looking-for-fael">Looking for Fael</a> isn't a difficult game to pitch, but perhaps one that takes a second to get to grips with. You play as, well, not Fael, but his roommate, who, as you may have guessed, is looking for Fael after receiving a strange voicemail message where he says he is somehow lost in your apartment. What follows is then a reality bending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game where the world itself is a puzzle, but also you have to play a spin (pun intended) on the objectively best game ever made, Tetris.
</p>
<p>
A thing to note about Looking for Fael is that it is a game that wants you to take notes. It suggests as such before its demo kicks off, and you quickly find that that will be the case, given that your first task is figuring out the code to your post box (though, memory will likely save you at this stage). Upon opening this box, you are greeted with an off-brand Game Boy, a Game Leaf in this instance, which you can then dock in at various points to play games of sort-of Tetris.
</p>
<p>
By this I mean you have a set list of blocks that you push out from pre-determined sides of the screen, which then have to fall on particular points to complete the puzzle. After doing this a handful of times, a doohicky lights up and you light up some squares and bam, what was the hallway outside of your apartment is now also your apartment, but different, stranger, covered in greenery. You catch a glimpse of the outside world, and where a vaguely European city was before is now simply an endless sky.
</p>
<p>
You complete a couple more Tetris puzzles, each steadily increasing in difficulty, requiring you to use that part of your brain that helps you pack your suitcase again after you bought way too much stuff in that once in a lifetime trip to Japan, and you bend reality to enter yet another apartment. And more and more puzzles within the world itself pop up, varying in nature and complexity, like one where you have to pause various documentaries about stick insects at just the right time.
</p><p>
Quite quickly Looking for Fael called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witness">The Witness</a> to mind, albeit without the obvious baggage attached to that one. It's a sort of escape room of a game, one where you really need to love both Tetris and potentially obtuse puzzles with equal intensity. I don't know if I can bring that intensity, but I'm certainly quite curious about the full thing.
</p>
<p>
It's filled with such lovely art too, various boxes of faux Gundam strewn about the place, one room which has a mixture of fan art of literally Samus Aran, Aerith Gainsborough, Goku, and more alongside fictitious posters and comics that I desperately wish were real. Completely unrelated to this, I found a lot of joy in seeing European plug sockets. How often do you see those in games! Silly, I know, but it tickled me in just the right way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the demo for Looking for Fael is available as part of this season's Steam Next Fest, so you can have a gander, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521170/Looking_For_Fael/">here</a>.
