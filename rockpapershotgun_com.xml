            <p>
Ho, Lethal Companions! Put down your airhorns, let fall your precious armfuls of plastic fish, and prick up your freakin' ears. Something is coming to 2023's breakout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> multiplayer game. Something that will make the music boxes and springhead marionettes look like child's playthings! I mean, like the child's playthings they already look like, but without the parts that make them horrifying. That something is... to be announced, but I considered the below teaser text pithy enough to be worth a shout regardless.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The new creature is technically maybe the most powerful creature in the game, and the power easily goes to its head," explains appallingly young developer Zeekerss on <a href="https://x.com/ZeekerssRBLX/status/1926872112347722041">social media</a>. "Sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense, just because it can."
</p>
<p>
There is an infinity of enigma couched within the words "sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense". There are countless things in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> that defy sense-making, not least the game's players, who repeatedly land on emaciated moons populated by giant spiders and ghost girls to harvest rubber duckies and V-type engines, which they then feed to a mouth in a wall. I look forward to experiencing how Zeekerss plans to raise the stakes. 
</p>
<p>
In general, I like the idea of an entity deliberately deciding to do things that seem nonsensical. When we encounter this in other games, we tend to call it an error, depending on our flexible understanding of where the border between sense and nonsense lies. I've always enjoyed reading forum thread attempts to reach across the line and redefine "purely" errant behaviour as plausible. For example, weaving a little mythology around the fact that horses in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> are able to witness crimes. It's because every horse in Tamriel is descended from Horseplay, God of Tattletaling.
</p>
<p>
Lethal Company's thunder has been stolen by, amongst others, the recent R.E.P.O., with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/repo-is-steams-latest-viral-horror-despite-its-high-mate-requirement">"Jim Henson does Nier Automata"</a> characters. Still, it remains a grand and very sociable anti-capitalist chiller. I'm deeply thankful to Zeekerss for engineering a genre of extraction game in which the extraction process is fundamentally cursed. On which note, this news article is now over - please gather up your airhorns and plastic fish and get back to the ship, pronto. Does anybody hear giggling?

My sherry-swilling, moustache-twirling armchair theorist understanding of <a href="https://www.secore.org/en/our-work/all-about-corals/coral-reef-crisis">ocean-wide coral decline</a> is that addressing it will require a, forgive me, seachange in attitudes towards the "natural" realm we generally position as external and other, ripe for the despoiling - a new way of inhabiting and co-constituting this mote caught in a sunbeam, this stargazing planet from which lamentation is spun, this blithe blue impossibility we (but who are "we"???) call home. Failing that, perhaps we can ask some magic Pixar squid to play underwater <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is my fairly jaded introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-below">Life Below</a>, the latest game from Trolls vs Vikings devs Megapop and Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus publishers Kasedo, which I do genuinely find intriguing in that it is trying to do two, somewhat incompatible things.

On the one polyp, it wants to educate players about organisms that, as the PR pitch explains, make up 0.01% of the ocean floor, and yet support 25% of ocean life, with input from marine biologists. On the other polyp, it would hate you to get the impression that it's just here to teach you things. Heavens, no! Life Below is a real-ass strategy management game, whose relatively bizarre pedagogic aspects are kept firmly in check, but hopefully not suffocated by its adherence to genre.</p>
<p>"While the environment and sustainability are important themes, this isn't 'edu-tainment' - this is a <em>proper</em> strategy game," comments the press release, emphasis theirs. They also want it to be one of "the most accessible city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> ever": Life Below is being created in collaboration with disability consultant Arevya and gaming charity Special Effect UK. 
</p>
<p>
In Life Below, you are a representative of Gaia, personification of Earth's life force. Gaia is often invoked in games with upbeat ecological vibes. I would quite like wholesome gamedevs to spend more time reading about Gaia as originally depicted in Greek myth. In keeping with much of Greek myth, it's an absolute quagmire. Did you know that Gaia spawned Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, using the hacked-off testicles of her husband, Uranus, after she conspired with her son Cronus to have him carved to pieces, in vengeance for Uranus turning Gaia's very body into a kind of cyclops petting zoo? Let's have some of <em>that</em> in games with eco themes, and fewer puppy-eyed jellyfish bois.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how it works is that you send out your twinkling octopus children to cultivate a grid of barren seafloor, planting the equivalent of buildings on resource nodes, and using fixtures such as "seagrass lure" to summon a range of aquatic species to your coral city. You must then keep those lifeforms happy and protect them from threats. The latter include biome change, infestations of creatures who threaten to wreck the reef's equilibrium, and fluctuating algae levels. 
</p>
<p>
The worst nasties, such as oil spills and floating garbage patches, may require the attention of "special wildlife". Without consulting any Wiki pages, I'm envisaging some kind of plastic-eating bacteria who live inside the mouth of a roving basking shark. Not all the external elements are undesirable: sometimes, a nice whale might swim overhead. I'm not sure what the effect will be on your reef. It'll be interesting to discover whether Life Below can translate any of its oceanic learnings into novel mechanics, or whether this is just a Little Mermaid skinpack for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game is out in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932150/Life_Below/">The Steam page is here</a>. Look out for a demo during Next Fest in June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-of-the-best-skating-games-are-back-on-steam-after-being-mysteriously-pulled-from-sale-months-ago<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Two very good skating games are back up for sale on Steam after disappearing for four months. Bright 'n' cheery skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and dystopian rollerskate shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-have-been-de-listed-from-steam-and-nobody-knows-why">vanished in a cloud of toxic corporate smoke</a> in February this year, some time after the closure of the games' developers Roll7. But it looks like the poisonous fumes have finally cleared, and the games are once again available.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not clear why the games have been absent. But it is very likely the result of legal and business hullabaloo caused by parent company Take-Two Interactive last year. Come with me now on a dollar-burning trip through the wastes of global financial malignancy, as I tell a tale as old and stupid as time.</p>
<p>The original developers of the games, Roll7, were owned by publishers Private Division, who were in turn owned by merciless corpocolossus Take-Two Interactive. In May last year Private Division were sold off by their business daddy to a private equity firm, and the studio who actually made good games, Roll7, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">unceremoniously shut down</a> as a result. The CEO of Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">tried to deny this</a>, but the effect on workers at both Roll7 and other Private Division studios (like the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> developers) was clear. They were all laid off. </p>
<p>It's a disappointing, if familiar, tale. But the delisting of the games months after the sale and their reappearance this week is a weird afterword. On the Steam page for both games, 2K (Take-Two's publishing moniker) are now listed as publisher. At the time of the sale, Take-Two said they were including all of Private Divisions "live and unreleased" games. But they now claim otherwise. 2K has "confirmed that neither Rollerdrome nor OlliOlli World were included in the Private Division sale, and that it is now the publisher of both games," according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/olliolli-world-and-rollerdrome-are-back-on-steam-after-being-delisted-4-months-ago-when-2k-sold-off-private-division/">PC Gamer</a>. Weird. </p>
<p>Whatever the dumbass legal reason that caused the games to disappear, it appears to be solved. Now you enter the realm of minor ethical dilemma: buy the games because they are excellent, or ignore them completely because the company who stands to profit fired everyone who worked on said bangers? Of course, other skulduggery is possible, as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kimhu.bsky.social/post/3kztixxrogd26">at least two people</a> who worked on the game. Do whatever you like, I can't tell you what's right. What do I know? I'm just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood">the 21st best player of OlliOlli 2</a> (on PlayStation 4). </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Reader, I'm getting some serious de ja vu from the the poster for <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">Liberation Escape Rooms</a> 'Castle Of Conundrums' experience, but I'm having trouble placing it. I don't <em>think</em> I've been to this escape room before, never having visited the town of Southaven, Mississippi. Perhaps I should go? The <a href="https://escaperoom.com/venue-game/liberation-escape-rooms-castle-of-conundrums-southaven-ms-usa">reviews are</a> positively glowing. "Very exciting and unique escape rooms," writes Anna R. Five stars! "Today's game in the Castle just blew us away," enthuses Tracey S. Five stars again! An unmissable experience by all accounts. And yet, I'd feel woefully unequiped to take on the Castle Of Conundrums if I cannot solve the much more pressing conundrum at hand.</p>

<p>"The king and his knights are on a quest to protect the crown. While they are away, a new and formidable threat appears just beyond the castle walls," reads the lore blurb. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Worst possible time this could have happened. "Can you prove your worthiness in Merlin’s trials, become a knight, and defend the kingdom?". Wait. What? Why is Merlin holding trials when the castle is in danger from a threat - need I remind you - that is <em>just beyond the castle walls</em>?! There's no time for your classic chicanery, Merlsy! We need knights <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A familiar set-up, no doubt. But no, no. That's not it. There's something <em>else</em> familiar about the poster for Liberation Escape Rooms Presents The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5. Why, it's that plaque in the top left, isn't it? The breastplate. The crossed swords. Why, that's definitely Dark Knight Armoury's <a href="https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/product/heraldic-eagle-breastplate-with-two-decorative-swords-wall-plaque/">Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque</a>! The only problem is that I've never laid eyes on Dark Knight Armoury's Heraldic Eagle Breastplate with Two Decorative Swords Wall Plaque, so it must be something else.</p>
<p>"We have done a handful of escape rooms in the Memphis area and this was by far one of the best!!!!!" writes Alicia B. Five stars again! Can you not see the subterfuge occurring right before your eyes, Alicia? You and your other five star compatriots? Are you so swayed by Liberation Escape Rooms' - by all accounts - unbeatable customer service that you've willingly blinded yourself to the lies contained in the poster for The Castle Of Conundrums Recommended for 2-8 players Difficulty 4 out of 5? Is it left solely to me to unpack its uncanny familiarity; the sole possessor of open eyes in a land where gummy-lidded herds chew mindlessly on opiatic cud like newborn foals?</p>
<p>Hang on. Hang on. It's the bloody font, isn't it? Classic <a href="https://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/bluebeard/">bluebeard</a>. I'd recognise you anywhere. Phew.</p>

            <p>“The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne," wrote Chaucer. But you'd trained hard with that crossbow, and let any man in bolting distance try to claim you hadn't mastered it. You never wanted to go to war, but the crops were failing, you'd just lost your seventeenth child to medium-pox, and dark portents swirled on the horizon like curdled goat's milk. Also, the actual goat's milk was curdling.</p>
<p>In that tent, you'd communed with angels, and the righteous fury of all the heavens coursed through every fibre of your being. You'd likely die today, you knew. But you'd die knowing you did all you could to put this fair kingdom to rights. You step outside, breathe deep the morning air, and immediately eat a point blank pump-action shotgun to the torso. Then you lose both your legs to the tank shell. Then someone runs over your corpse with a dirtbike. Bloody typical.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> made memeish waves when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">first teased last February</a>, and while it'd be easy to write it off as just a one-note joke based on an inherently goofy power imbalance (you have guns and tanks, they have swords and horses), there does look to be a bit more occurring here. It's a four-player co-op action game where you'll be also able to command armies a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a>, and build fortifications on the fly a la, uh, Fortnite I guess. I estimate the simple joys of shotgun vs pikeman will last for about forty minutes, but assuming the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> layer holds up, I'm still very much into this.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on the single-save honour mode, and Kingmakers looks to have its own honour mode of sorts, too, should you fancy it. As mentioned in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2109770/discussions/0/4340977379955918858/">dev Q&amp;A</a>, you'll be able to use a sword and shield, so it sounds like you can theoretically ignore the helicopters and grenade launchers and just get stuck in the melee. I'm not sure why you would, mind. Honour is for chumps that didn't bring enough helicopters. Kingmakers releases in early access October 8th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
