            <p>Every now and then we publish a round-up of game or demo recommendations, and all you regular readers dutifully fill the comments with recommendations of your own. FOOLS. Our round-ups are, of course, a devious trap for your curiosity and connoisseurship, designed to save us the labour of discovering good games for ourselves. You know in Batman Forever when Jim Carrey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAjgzwFHXd4">uses Riddler TV to steal everybody's IQs</a>? Well picture me doing that, except that I am not wearing tight green pyjamas (unless you want to picture me that way - no offence taken) and I am actually filling my skull with everything you ever knew about, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moadra">Moadra</a>'s case, manky Super Metroid clones.</p><!--more-->

<p>Batman Forever is the wrong analogy for this news piece. Let's get back on track. I learned about Moadra from a comment by Galactic Man on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">our latest Steam Fest demo round-up</a>, Developed by Gloomsoft, it casts you as a dinkier species of Predator, scouring inky catacombs of corpseflesh for a missing alien princess.</p>
<p>That's the plan, anyway, until you find the princess and she rips your gun-arm off. Fortunately, a fugitive boffin soon hooks you up with a new arm comprised of evolving primordial muck. Thanks to this timely injection of locally grown biomatter, you gain access to an upgrades tree with unlockable appendages such as Morrigan-style vampire wings. Then you set off afresh to find that pesky princess and, I imagine, rip <em>her</em> arms off. I think Moadra has the right attitude toward monarchy so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713730/Moadra/">The Steam demo</a> plays a lot like the more recent iterations of Metroid, with a fast, nimble protagonist who can crawl into chutes (no Samusball functionality, alas) and charge up projectiles that bounce from certain surfaces. The backdrop is straight out of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, however. Everything looks like the inside of a sickly lung. Such technology as may be found is busted and unclean.</p>
<p>A smaller point of differentiation: you shoot doors to open them, as in Metroid, but in Moadra - oh, I'm just picking up on the fact that "Moadra" sounds like "Metroid" through the Predator's voicebox! - you shoot them to activate short-ranged teleporters that flense you apart and put you back together in the next room. To ask the age-old question regarding teleporters, am I dying every time I use one, with my atoms and memories then forming a brand new being?</p>
<p>Honestly, if that's the worst thing that happens in Moadra I'll be thankful. There's a bossfight that basically traps you inside a cybernetic stomach with a brace of turrets and the head of a bellowing rat ogre. There's also some scanner functionality care of a flying drone pal that naturally harkens forward to Metroid's first 3D incarnation, Metroid Prime. Perhaps a cloaking device as well, Gloomsoft?</p>
<p>Will Moadra stand apart from Metroid in hindsight or will it prove to be just the same old metroidvania fittings coated in squirming filth, like a Samus figurine retrieved from the toilet? I'm not sure, but I look forward to finding out. There's no release date yet. Thanks again, Galactic Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
