            <p>“While GTA lets players experience a fictional underworld of lawless enterprise, the entities behind PlayerAuctions own and operate a real one". So claims a lawyer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands </a>publisher Take-Two Interactive in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon">complaint filed on Tuesday</a> against third-party asset marketplace PlayerAuctions. They accuse PlayerAuctions - who have already faced similar accusations from Roblox - of selling modified player accounts obtained by hacking, via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>(I have no choice but to respect the hustle of trying to make GTA's "fictional underworld of lawless enterprise" sound as cool as possible during a lawsuit. "While GTA lets players do cool and fun <strong>fake</strong> crimes...")</p>
<p>"The website PlayerAuctions.com offers a vast online marketplace containing thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA V content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits,” continues the complaint.</p>

<p>As Polygon note, selling a GTA Online account to another player is not strictly illegal, though it's against terms of service. It's this alleged infringement, alongside copyright and trademark infringement claims, that comprise the complaint.</p>
<p>By offering account boosting, modded accounts, and currency drops, Take Two claim that PlayAuctions offers "an otherwise impossible experience: new players can begin GTA V with billions in VC and with a massive arsenal of in-game content—such as vehicles, clothing, and weapons—configurations only possible by hacking and modifying the GTA V game in breach of the Rockstar TOS."</p>
<p>"In some cases, these listings advertise 'unlock all' accounts preloaded with maxed-out character levels and virtually all in-game assets available to acquire in GTA Online," they continue. "Moreover, users buying Account Boosting Services give control of their GTA V account temporarily to an unknown third party – in violation of the Rockstar TOS – and disclose their GTA V account information, including passwords". PlayerAuctions take "at least 12.99% in fees," write Polygon, and the lawsuit claims that this amounts to "many tens of millions or even upwards of 100 million dollars."</p>
<p>“At the scale of its website," say Take-Two, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA V player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game. PlayerAuctions’ business also actively promotes behavior that risks creating a ‘race for the bottom’ where innocent GTA V players feel pressured to buy unauthorized digital goods and service, or else resort to using hacks or cheating themselves, to ‘keep up’ with PlayerAuctions’ customers."</p>
<p>A cynic might offer a translation to the above along the lines of "won't somebody please think of the innocent Shark Cards". Not me though. I look at GTA V's <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96595/grand-theft-auto-franchise-revenues-break-8-9-billion-since-gta-vs-launch/index.html">reported £6.9 billion revenue since release</a> and think, now that's just some good honest videogame sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520139/roblox-lawsuit-playerauctions-trading">Roblox sued PlayerAuctions for similar claims</a> last month, report Polygon. Take-Two's latest gift to innocent GTA V players is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5s-free-enhanced-update-spoiled-by-missing-in-game-text-chat-but-it-may-only-be-temporary">reportedly somewhat borked</a> GTA V Enhanced Edition.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "news that will get you banished from society if you try to explain it to anyone who doesn't live on the internet," the owner of an erotic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> subreddit has had their moderator status revoked from the main subreddit after a brief civil war surrounding AI generated art culminated with developer LocalThunk intervening. Cheers to <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a> for the spot.</p>
<p>Many threads lie dead and buried in the bloody wake of all this, but the brief rundown is that moderator DrTankHead - who also runs r/balatromance - waded into the following thread:</p>

<p>"Is it too much to ask to have a fun subreddit about a fun game that isn't being held hostage by a horny pro-AI weirdo?...that is too much to ask, isn't it," wrote user cherrycokeicee in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7l3e8/this_subreddit_is_doomed/">now locked thread</a>. Much banana flinging ensued, until Localthunk eventually had to get involved themselves.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art. This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (A Playstack representative told me this) but from a interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art"> they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds," Localthunk continued. "The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team. We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon."</p>
<p>The sub's rules do indeed now say "No AI generated art or content" underneath the "No low-effort posts/No spam" section.</p>
<p>After having their mod status removed, DrTankHead <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatromance/comments/1j82g1w/addressing_the_main_subs_ai_art_ban/">posted in r/balatroromance</a>, which he hopes will now offer a similar haven for AI art as it historically has for horny posting. "Please just get off Reddit for a week or two," replied one user.</p>
<p>Localthunk recently took time out from having good opinions in public to <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh">post a detailed blog chronicling Balatro's development timeline</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
