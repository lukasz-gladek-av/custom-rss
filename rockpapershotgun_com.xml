Alright, so, I know those of us on PC haven't even had the chance to play the first one yet, but it seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> have essentially confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> 2 is in the works. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/">Insider Gaming</a>, Shift Up recently shared its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">investor relations presentation</a> for May of this year, most of it being businessy nonsense neither you or I could give two tosses about. The key thing is a slide in its strategy section, showing a very basic plan for its games Nikke and Stellar Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On Stellar Blade's section, it shows a label titled "platform expansion", presumably in reference to that upcoming PC port. There's also a bit that just plainly says "sequel", which, I don't know about you, certainly implies that a sequel is likely to be in the works. This section also shows that all of these steps are being taken between 2024, i.e. the original release year of Stellar Blade, and 2027, seeming to suggest that Shift Up plan to release a sequel by then.
</p>
<p>
On top of that there's the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studios-next-game-reportedly-aaa-action-rpg-titled-project-witches">previously reported Project Witches</a> listed, also seemingly due out before 2027. Not many details on that one still, but it appears to be early days still as another section notes that there's only 18 people working on it currently compared to the 107 devs working on Stellar Blade, and 148 devs working on Nikke. Worth noting this might have changed by now, as these figures are as of March 2025, either way, you probably shouldn't expect a proper reveal of that for a while.
</p>
<p>
Whether the sequel comes to PC whenever it launches, I couldn't tell you, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game is due out for us in less than a month. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">You'll be able to pick it up on PC on June 11th</a>, though not necessarily everywhere, as it's currently region locked. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blades-devs-would-like-you-to-know-you-dont-need-a-psn-account-on-pc-as-they-work-on-the-region-lock-problem">Shift Up is working on fixing that at least</a>!

            <p>
Right, anyone in need of something that's just generally quite pleasant? I've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> ever since, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">it was revealed</a>, honestly. It's suitably strange, as per usual with the cult game maker's works, this time putting you in the position of a teenager who is constantly t-posing. There's also sandwich-making giraffes and other strange inhabitants, and you can now take a look at it yourself in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727290/to_a_T_Demo/">demo that's dropped on Steam today</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo doesn't sound particularly long, as you just get to play through its first episode. Still, sounds like enough time to get to do things like brushing your teeth, something I genuinely couldn't tell you whether that's been in a game before or not. There is also a "very cute dog"! All very nondescript stuff, but I trust Takahashi to deliver on the weirdness. Plus, your save data in the demo carries through to the full game, always a neat feature.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, a couple of songs from the game have been released too. There's <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=wy7WY8G6Do3_GdCrsmPyWg">Perfect Shape by PREP</a>, an upbeat track that wants to make sure you know you're the perfect shape (aww, thanks!). And there's the slightly chiller <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=sqwwoGAmx850yjYtNIG8aQ">Giraffe Song</a>, performed by Rebecca Sugar, i.e. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a> contributor and Steven Universe creator. Honestly, both have already hooked me, some incredibly strong earworms here that I don't think have been heard in a game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>'s theme song. Cripes, now I'm going to be singing that to myself for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Not long to wait for the full thing now either, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">as it's due out next week on May 28th</a>.

            <p>I recently stumbled on <a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/erostasis">Erostasis</a>, a brilliant and filthy cybernetic microgame in which you are a wiry meatpuppet created to, aha, satisfy the urges of an exceedingly backed-up bionic starship. Over the course of a very busy 20 minutes or so, you visit various self-aware ship systems and play out their kinks. The writing is clattery, theory-drenched and sensual, set to moaning electronica. The visuals are a gunky collage of seeming porno and industrial stock footage. It’s glorious. Probably don’t play it where members of the public can see.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I were to choose <em>a polar opposite of that game</em> it might be new metroidvania Mio: Memories In Orbit, which also takes place on a living ship and is as elegant and videogamey and serenely sexless as Erostasis is subversive and debauched. I really like the looks of Mio, too, for wholly different reasons, and I’m tickled pink that publishers Focus Entertainment have managed to email me about it while I’m still recovering from my Erostasis experience. </p><!--more-->

<p>Created by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116580/Shady_Part_of_Me/">Shady Part Of Me</a> developers Douze Dixièmes, Memories In Orbit casts you as a delicate but powerful android exploring an enormous, artisanal space ark whose AI caretakers have ceased functioning. Over the course of presumably many centuries, the vessel's innards have exploded into a wilderness of cosmic vegetation.</p>
<p>The visuals take inspiration from “comics, paintings and anime”, and are set to “lo-fi beats and choral melodies”. They remind me a teeny bit of Biblical beat ‘em up El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. There’s a similar, faerie frailty to the setting, with warmly painted architecture and machinery bleaching or darkening to pencil strokes in the backdrop. Mio herself moves and fights with the aid of golden tendrils emerging from her skull. These are very much not the kinds of tendrils you encounter in Erostasis, a game in which it is generally difficult to tell one body part from another.</p>
<p>Its uncommonly artful art direction aside, Mio seems pretty routine for a metroidvania. There are abilities and modifiers to acquire, new areas or shortcuts to access with those abilities, friendly robots to repair for lore and upgrades, a bestiary of 30 enemy units, and 15 bossfights. The trailer suggests that you’ll do a lot of chaining together moves to overcome sequences of obstacles and build a combo. Again, all quite familiar, but persuasively executed.</p>
<p>Mio: Memories In Orbit launches this year, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/">the Steam page</a>. It and Erostasis join last year's seedy sarcophagus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultros">Ultros</a> in the pantheon of games set on living starships. I am fervently hoping that we’re in the middle of some kind of floral fleshcruiser renaissance. I'm trying to work out which format or genre I'd like next. Maybe a bioship life sim? Where you have to worry about cellular mitosis and deep space photosynthesis, rather than managing a crew?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
