For the most part, anything to do with the Nintendo Switch 2 won't have much to do with anyone in this neck of the woods, but its inaugural Direct did have some goodies for us PC players too. Like, for example, the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> Chapters 3 and 4 now have a release date, June 5th (which also happens to be when the Switch 2 comes out but that's neither here nor there). Mind, this is almost a good seven years after the first chapter dropped, and almost four since Chapter 2 was released, so it's been a long time coming.

That release date reveal came with a little teaser trailer that kicked things off with a person in a not at all annoying dog costume (that honestly looks pretty damn comfortable) before showing off a few, brief clips from the third and fourth chapters. It looks like everyone's favourite font-themed Skeleton will be back once again, alongside some new mechanics during battle, one of which appears to be manoeuvring your analogue sticks to protect yourself fromâ€¦ squiggles?

There's a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a>-esque bit too, and a couple of teases of scenes explicitly from Chapters 3 and 4 (there's tiny bits of the first two in the trailer) that seem a bit mysterious as well. Not much to go off of all in, but when has Toby Fox and co ever given away the goose that easily?
</p>
<p>
I can't offer you any more details than that, because there aren't any, though there is apparently a <a href="https://deltarune.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a> coming with some details sometime today that might be worth keeping an eye on.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Chapters 3 and 4 will be paid unlike the first two, and they won't be the end of Deltarune either. There's plans for a total of seven, so we'll have to wait and see about those last three.
