You want an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update? You've got an Assassin's Creed Shadows update! Well, you will tomorrow, September 11th anyway, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> did release the patch notes for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game in any case. Here's what you can expect for the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 title update! First up is the fact that the game will be ready for its first expansion, Claws of Awaji, which is due out next week, September 16th. The level cap is also being raised to 100 to account for the expansion!
</p>
<p>
For everyone who won't be picking up the expansion, there is a new free story quest, Go With The Bo. Here you'll join Junjiro as he sets out to meet a legendary Bo master and a new weapon that Naoe can use, the Bo staff. There's also new hideout upgrades, including two more upgrade levels, 20 new enhancements, and three new Hideout levels. Upgrading the Nando to level two will now give you the ability to meditate and move the time forward to the next six o'clock, AM or PM.
</p>
<p>
If you upgrade the study to level four, scouts will now have the ability to reveal viewpoints and safehouses, and with upgrading the Kakurega to the same level, uncovering all viewpoints within a province reveals it completely.
</p>
<p>
There are two new gear quality tiers that you can upgrade your kit to if you've got your forge to level six, called mythic and artifact. "Once an item reaches a new quality, it can be further upgraded through eight additional levels to unlock its full potential," the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv/ac-shadows-title-update-111-release-notes">patch notes</a> explain.
</p><p>
Ubisoft still can't seem to let go of Ezio either, as in the Animus Hub there are some fresh rewards for a new project called Sanctuary. These include Ezio's outfit, Ezio's outfit but for a cat, an Ezio-themed kusarigama, and a Charm of Firenze trinket.
</p>
<p>
There are also new anomalies to be found in Awaji if you own the expansion, and cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS. You'll also find a number of other fixes and tweaks, but you can read the full patch notes to learn about those small details.
