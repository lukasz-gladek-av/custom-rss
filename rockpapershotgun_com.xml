            <p>Mindseye, the game from ex-Rockstar president Leslie Benzies-helmed studio Build a Rocket Boy, has arrived. Its launch has gone, er, a bit glitchily, currently landing the game at a mixed reception on Steam. That said, the studio have at least confirmed an update designed to improve Mindseye's performance is on the way.
</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, the sort of GTA-ish/Cyberpunk-ish game's road to release had been plenty weird prior to it breaking cover. Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard had seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-concerted-effort-against-it">suggested on the game's Discord server</a> that he believed people were being paid to say negative things about Mindseye, and two other high-profile execs had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-week-before-launch-two-mindseye-studio-executives-have-left-the-company-which-im-sure-is-a-positive-sign">departed the studio</a> not long before release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's now debuted to mixed Steam reviews and plenty of clips on the socials of players <a href="https://x.com/ItsJesseGomez/status/1932524274700480613">running into glitches</a> or citing issues. The one that's caught my eye in particular is <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/viktorlindn/status/1932508112407445708">folks</a> failing a mission because they've nudged an NPC named Seb with their ATV and he's responded by bursting into a spaghettified mess of elongated limbs.</p>
<p>To be fair, being hit by a vehicle moving at speed is generally known to make your body contort in painful-looking ways that it isn't supposed to, but I've yet to see any real life car accidents result into someone's neck, arms and legs all instantly growing the giraffe length as they roll across the ground.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> also mention issues getting the game to run at a decent clip, with some citing the likes of stuttering, FPS drops, textures flickering, and also enemy corpses which "twitch like ragdoll puppets".</p>
<p>In response to the day one performance issues, Build a Rocket Boy have said they've got a third patch for the game in the works, with a community manager writing the following in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">a post</a> on the game's subreddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also asked for feedback on the game's main campaign, and its map editory "Build.Mindseye" mode. I'll give them a 10/10 solely in the NPC spaghettification department.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ian Proulx, the CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developers 1047 Games, has apologised for wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' cap while talking about the game's battle royale mode on stage at Summer Game Fest. As you might have guessed, the hat drew unfavourable comparisons to US president Donald Trump's MAGA hats.</p>
<p>It'd have been a pretty dumb, controversy-baiting stunt for a games company CEO to pull at any point in recent history, but especially hasn't gone over well given the timing. As the SGF show happened, a large number of anti-ICE protests also began in response to violent immigration raids, and later that weekend Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj93d3r0zz0o">deployed the National Guard onto the streets</a>."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until yesterday, Proulx had opted not to apologise for the hat, which he wore while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">taking some shots</a> at the state of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter genre</a> right now, specifically going at the Call of Duty series for repetitive annual releases and wishing for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3. "I’m not here to apologize but I am here to clarify. This is not a political statement, it is quite literally what it says, so take it at face value," he wrote in a tweet on June 7.</p>
<p>"I don't regret what I said to be candid. I think that I stand by it and my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody," he said of that tweet in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">IGN</a> published yesterday, doubling down on decling to apologise.</p>
<p>Just a few hours prior to that article's publication, however, Proulx u-turned and <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">posted a video apology</a> Splitgate 2's official Twitter account, admitting that the hat was a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise...at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with," the exec said in the video.</p>
<p>"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever and I’m not an idiot, obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy," Proulx continued, "But we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth, which is we do want to improve this genre and we are disappointed with the state of the genre.</p>
<p>"You don't have to believe me, but the truth is I am sorry, and the reason I’m sorry is because of what this has done to the community...I hate seeing division, and that's what I'm seeing right now on both sides. There’s division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
