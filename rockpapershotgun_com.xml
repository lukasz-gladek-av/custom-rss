            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have made clear that they're still very much all-in on the game right now, with adding more stuff to the good shootery thing they've got going being the main focus. That said, the studio's bigwigs have provided a couple of hints at what the future might hold for them, with the latest being that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 is "hopefully many years away".</p>
<p>Also, they aren't fans of players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">voting to rename a city on Super Earth 'Gun'</a>, which is a thing that's been going on in Helldiverland lately.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This rare mention of the next Helldivers game is from Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, who hopped on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1395509386113450106">the game's Discord last night</a>, and was asked to paint a picture of what the next two years of Helldivers could look like.</p>
<p>"I'm very bought into the vision that Micke, Felix, Niklas and Marre (our game directors) and Johan have for the game," he responded, "It's great to be part of the ride. We honestly are focusing on the here and now. HD3 is hopefully many years away." This is one of very few times, as someone who's been covering Helldivers pretty closely over the past year, I can recall Jorjani ever mentioning Helldivers 3 by name.</p>
<p>When he talked about the studio's future on the same Discord server <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-ceo-still-main-focus-next-game-start-slowly-this-year">back in May</a>, he referred to whatever Arrowhead's next project is as "Game 6", which is an altogether more mysterious way to refer to something he said a "very, very small team" would start working on later this year. Meanwhile, Jorjani's predecessor and Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt has very much said Helldivers 3, but only when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-growing-into-helldivers-3-says-arrowhead-cco-pilestedt-taking-design-suggestions-miniguns">suggesting on Twitter</a> that Arrowhead would transform Helldivers 2 into that next game by continuing to update what they've already got on the go.</p>
<p>Nothing in what Jorjani said here contradicts any of that, but assuming the grow-one-game-into-another plan is still on the cards, it's noteworthy that he mentions HD3 by name, rather than just telling folks Helldivers 2's the thing to watch.</p>
<p>Anyway, beyond that, this spot of Discord chatter also saw Jorjani tell another player that the devs have discussed adding support for DLSS and FSR frame generation, but "other more fundamental problems that impact performance" will need sorting first.</p>
<p>Also, he voted for Everlasting Memory in Arrowhead's ongoing poll to pick a new name for the Super Earth city of Remembrance, which players recently helped rebuild via their in-game exploits, and are hellbent on renaming 'Gun' Jorjani joked about Arrowhead possibly naming the city what the studio likes anyway, adding: "I really don't like the name <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gun">GUN</a> personally. but not my decision".</p>
<p>Shooting from the hip there, Mr video game fellow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun]]></content:encoded>

            <p>4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> games tend to look an elegantly patterned tablecloth covered in toy soldiers. Entrotria looks like a geode full of maggots, or the inside of a prehistoric fridge. Admit it, you did not clock the screenshot above and think "4X". You scanned it and thought "I don't remember sneezing" and by extension, "I need to get my sinuses drained immediately". Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The visuals are even more unhinging for the seeming straightforwardness of the game as described on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484960/Entrotria/">the Steam page</a>. "A turn-based space 4X strategy game with distinctive resource management. Explore exotic systems and acquire powerful technologies," it reads. "Exploit your planets, trade with other races and destroy those who stand in your way."</p>
<p>Clarity is often a virtue, developer Simon Alber, but I fear you are underselling the plankton. Assuming that's plankton. Continuing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morsels-is-my-game-of-the-summer-a-stinking-collage-of-nuclear-throne-and-pokemon">my recent thoughts about Morsels</a>, I love the splattergun strangeness of this game, which really comes alive in the real-time autobattling segments. I am looking forward to discovering whether it plays as differently as it looks, as and when it releases, which will be... somewhen. In the meantime, here are some bullet points:</p>
<blockquote><p>- 12 asymmetric species</p>
<p>- 300+ technologies</p>
<p>- 150+ different hexagon types</p>
<p>- 250+ buildings / building upgrades</p>
<p>- complex politics and market system</p>
<p>- versatile spaceships and epic space battles</p></blockquote>

            <p>If you don't have anything else on this morning, perhaps you'd like to fill the life of a small clay golem up with purpose. I cannot be certain, but at present I believe that the easiest way to do this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393760/Tall_Trails/">with the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tall-trails">Tall Trails</a>. It reminds me of playing old N64 3D platformers round my mate Liam's house between watching VHS recordings of Keenan and Kel, which is a nice place to be. It's also got Breath Of The Wild's stamina wheel and freeform clamouring, although you don't need to worry about that too much because you can stuff chilli peppers into your boot and use it like a jetpack.</p>

<p>Tall Trails is very generous in many of the best ways. It's generous with the sonorous cheer of its colour palette and wobbly strumfoolery of its music. Most of all, it's generous with its movement tricks. You pluck peppers and sunflowers and mushrooms from the soil and stuff them in the boot you carry on your back. Spend a mushroom for a big jump. Use a chilli pepper to rocket off to a better life in the sky for several seconds. Commandeer a sunflower to fly, watching the individual petals tick down to mark your remaining air time.</p>
<p>It's also just rhetorically doofy in ways that make me smile.</p>

<p>Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Blast off with your Rocket Boot!</strong> Use items as fuel in your Rocket Boot to blast yourself upwards! Each item has different powers: jet pack with hot peppers, hover with whirligigs, or swing on webs with spiders!</li>
<li><strong>Explore a weird &amp; wonderful world!</strong> Summit mountains, help out at camp, and search for treasure. Traverse 5 unique biomes, each full of new and exciting ways to move and explore.</li>
<li><strong>Find your purpose in life!</strong> Every golem has a purpose… but not you? What's up with that??</li>
<li><strong>Customize your look &amp; build!</strong> Find &amp; upgrade powerful badges to increase your platforming abilities to unreasonable levels! Or just focus on collecting hats!</li>
<li><strong>Tons of Replayability!</strong> Once you're done with the main story, start your adventure anew in a randomly generated world. Explore islands no one else has seen before!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you like the demo, the full game is out next month, August the 4th. It's made by Brady Soglin. Brady Soglin is an anagram for Yr Sad <a href="https://theboglins.com/">Boglin</a>. Don't be sad, Boglin. Play some Tall Trails. It's very nice.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/breath-of-the-wild-meets-banjo-kazooie-golem-adventure-tall-trails-is-just-plain-nice]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oblivion arguably isn't really Oblivion if you're not bouncing around Cyrodiil in an effort to level up your acrobatics slightly faster. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>'s devs knew that, and so opted to keep the classic "level up by doing the abilities you picked" approach, with some minor tweaks to make it less frustrating.</p>
<p>If, however, you long to ding by being handed boatloads of XP simply from completing quests and killing NPCs by any means, a modder's got you covered. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">working on</a> fleshing out a full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-esque settlement system for Oblivin' after midnight, MadAbormodding's decided to double down on the rads and bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s levelling system to Cyrodiil.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their mod, an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4881?tab=description">alternate levelling system</a> dubbed Mad Experience, is billed as a simple effort to let you gain XP from kills, quests, and discovering new locations, instead of levelling being tied to skills.</p>
<p>It looks like your skill stats will still go up as they do in the original game, they just won't contribute to you vaulting up the levels and getting the option to boost the values of three attributes. So, you're just racking up points in a different way. That said, I'd say that MadAbormodding's maybe underselling how impressive all this is, given that making fresh additions that fit seamlessly into the base game's mechanics or interface is something modders have initially struggled with.</p>
<p>Cue mods that add new skills, but, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-skyrim-style-smithing-system-mod">for example</a>, require you to track your progression up the ranks of that particular skill by consulting a book, rather than just being able to glance at the same menu which displays the rest of your abilities. That's not say modders haven't successfully made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">of</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1414">tweaks</a> to aspects of how Oblivion Remastered's level-by-skilling system works, but to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time someone has totally rejigged it like this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether it's a mod I'll actually use in the long-term, bouncing around the map because I specced into acrobatics being a thing I consider pretty central to the wider 2006 charm that I'm looking for when I decide to fire up Oblivion. That said, more options are always nice, and mixing 2006 nostalgia with 2008 nostalgia to form a weird rose-tinted soup could make for an intriguing experiment.</p>
<p>As it stands, Mad Experience lets you tweak how much XP each source dishes out via a config file or an in-game menu, with the latter requiring you to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">MadMCM</a>. MadAbormodding wrote that they're working on adding the likes of a proper progress bar, plus the ability to gain XP from the likes of lockpicking and pickpocketing. They're also thinking about static skill leveling that'd increase the Falloutyness by making skill values something you control by delegating points on level up.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. Unlike in vanilla Oblivion, a set of knees made of particularly robust jelly are not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-splices-fallout-3s-level-by-questing-into-cyrodiil-and-my-virtual-knees-are-glad]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve have begun removing a variety of sex games from Steam in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their recent updating of the platform's rules and regulations</a> to allow banks and credit card companies to essentially forbid certain kinds of "adult content". In a statement to RPS, a company representative confirmed that games are being delisted as a result of the rules change, adding that the developers in question are being given Steam app credits as compensation. The alternative, Valve suggest, is that banks and card companies might pull the plug on all transactions, and users in general would lose the ability to buy stuff on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks," the statement reads. "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>"We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they'd like to distribute on Steam in the future," it concludes. For context, app credits <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/appfee">cost $100</a> and are required to publish games on Steam. $100 is not a lot in terms of game sales: Valve don't appear to be compensating the devs concerned for the loss of future revenue.</p>
<p>Valve don't specify which payment processors, card networks and banks they're referring to in their statement, or which games have been removed. But a quick trip to <a href="https://steam-tracker.com/">Steam Tracker</a> reveals that a number of games have been delisted this month. (You can find them by typing "sex" and so forth into the search box and organising them by date. I know, my methods are pretty forensic.) There are also scattered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27"> </a><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhands31.bsky.social/post/3lu7mpmf2jk2n">reports</a> of delistings on Bluesky and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through the specifics of the games removed from Steam this month, mostly because there are scores of them and I can't confirm which were delisted for breaking the new rules. I will say that I find some of them repulsive, and that we should challenge, if not bury games that actively contribute to a culture of abuse. As in much of life, I do not think massive unaccountable finance corporations should get to decide where those goal posts stand.</p>
<p>Sexuality is as vast and miscellaneous as a skyful of constellations. Providing they are doing no harm, people should be able to explore and get their rocks off however they choose. I have played plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/help-a-pair-of-very-different-games-set-on-living-starships-have-caught-my-eye-simultaneously">games that look at sex</a> in ways I consider "unconventional", and yet not damaging, which I can well imagine the likes of Mastercard and Visa deeming beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Kaile Hultner of noescapevg.com was kind enough to quote my piece on Valve's revised "adult content" policy yesterday in <a href="https://noescapevg.com/banning-porn-is-one-of-valves-dumbest-decisions-yet/">their commentary article</a>, which brings in more context about the political climate in the USA, and expands on the point that banks and finance firms have long sought to play moral censor, disallowing the transaction of "adult" material or services they find objectionable.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy]]></content:encoded>
