            <p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this year, a group of former ZeniMax developers have formed a worker-owned studio dubbed Sackbird. Made up of folks who worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">cancelled MMO codenamed Blackbird</a>, the studio have confirmed they're working on an unnamed original game that'll hit PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Zenimax's Blackbird project was one of numerous games cancelled as Microsoft laid of around 9,000 staff in July, with the ZeniMax Online Studios United union left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">fighting for the jobs of members affected</a>. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">subsequently reported</a> that Blackbird was a sci-fi noir-ish third-person shooter with looty bits and lots of vertical movement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to the <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">formation of Sackbird Studios</a>, who've already won this year's award for most wonderfully tongue-in-cheek branding. The "independent, employee-owned game studio that is self-funded for multiple years" have adopted a roaming avian armed with a sack of belongings as their logo, and have <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/home">a website</a> which invites folks to "seek the sack" or "drop a sack" as a means of getting in touch.</p>
<p>Given how badly beaten most folks in and around the games industry are with the layoff truncheon at this point, it's lovely to see Sackbird having fun with what's happened. They're also very up front about using it to inform their new approach to game-making. "After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets," Sackbird COO David Worley, an ex-ZeniMax principal tools engineer, said. "We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>"We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people," Sackbird's CEO Lee Ridout, a long-time director of ecommerce for The Elder Scrolls Online, added. "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable."</p>
<p>Sackbird are currently made up of a "tight, senior team" of fewer than ten devs, and have confirmed that they're actively developing a currently unannounced "original project for PC and consoles". They plan to share more info about this first game when they're ready.</p>

            <p>You might remember that a little while ago, Bethesda <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elder-scrolls-6-npc-opportunity-charity-auction">announced an auction</a> which'd see the winner given the chance to design a character in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Bids were donations to the charity Make-A-Wish, and narrowly missing out on top spot was one from the folks behind the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, the series' long-running and very good independent wiki. The good news is that those folks how now met with Bethesda and had the chance to design their NPC, which'll be a memorial to a forum user whose roleplaying has crossed paths with official Elder Scrolls lore.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls 6," reads a post from the UESP lot earlier today, October 9th. "Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store."</p>
<p>I'll confess that despite being a big fan of the Elder Scrollage, I couldn't immediately recall hearing about these lorekeepers being offered the chance to design a character in the series' long-teased next entry. As it turns out, after coming up short of the NPC design auction's $85,300 dollar winning bid, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks ended up chatting to Bethesda about the reason they'd decided to get involved.</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKIovJ5P-Xn/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">group's aim</a> was to create a memorial in The Elder Scrolls 6 to honour the life of Loranna Pyrel, a forum user whose roleplay campaign series run between 2004 and 2006 crossed paths with official lore being penned by former Elder Scrolls designer and writer Ted Peterson.</p>
<p>As the roleplay series' <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Loranna%27s_RP">dedicated page</a> on the ever-reliable and detailed UESP puts it:</p>
<blockquote>The significance of Loranna's RP to unofficial lore lies in the forum posts of developer Ted Peterson, who used the roleplay as a doodle ground to play with worldbuilding and character ideas. According to Peterson, he would get insider information on what Bethesda was doing for the next game and its worldbuilding, such as King Helseth of Morrowind outlawing slavery or Arch-Mage Hannibal Traven of the Mages Guild existing, and incorporate it into the campaigns. Later on, he would use concepts originated in the roleplay, some of which made it into official lore via A Pocket Guide to the Empire: Third Edition and in-game books present in Oblivion. As a source, Loranna's RP can inform these official materials with greater context. Peterson himself maintains that roleplay is "only partially canon," and that its contents should be treated as a secondary source that only become fully canon or fully non-canon once incorporated into or disproved by primary sources later on.</blockquote>
<p>Despite the outcome of the auction, Bethesda agreed to let the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks design their character provided they could "match the auction amount with a group donation campaign to Make-A-Wish". Doing so took some teaming up with fellow Elder Scrolls lore site <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> and others, as well as a traffic bump spurred by the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><p>"It's kind of unbelievable that we got this far," the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks wrote in an Instagram post back in May. "This whole thing started on an offhand comment about possibly teaming up, and then grew into this giant group effort. We're looking forward to adding this character to TES VI. We couldn't think of a more appropriate way to honor Loranna's contributions to both the Elder Scrolls community and the lore than a community charity fundraising effort like this while simultaneously making an addition the lore proper.</p>
<p>It's always great to see the odd character in a massive RPG be used for this kind of thing, and I'm glad the folks who've facilitated me being able to instantly check what <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cattle">cows have looked like in every Elder Scrolls game</a> have been able to create an in-game way to remember Loranna.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft allegedly cancelled plans for a new Assassin's Creed game set in in the aftermath of the American Civil War last year, with online moaning about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> co-protagonist Yasuke and concerns over the volatility of the modern day US political climate being cited as reasons.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Game File</a>, which claims the game would have starred a black former slave who moves westwards from the south in search of a new life. He'd subsequently be recruited by the series' Assassins and return to the south in a story that'd involve confronting the rise of Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction era that spanned the 1860s and 70s.</p>
<p>Game File cites current and former Ubisoft staff who say that the game, which was in the concept phase, was canned in July 2024. Ubisoft management reportedly pointed to online vitriol in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke">black samurai Yasuke</a> being revealed as one of Shadows' protagonists as a reason behind the move, as well as concerns about the US' current political climate. The latter is alleged to have been the bigger factor in the cancellation. As one of Game File's sources put it, the game was viewed as being "too political in a country too unstable".</p>
<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ubisoft-shares-plummet-it-guides-further-cash-burn-2025-05-15/">rocky financial state</a> was also a reported factor in the decision, making execs keen to steer away from perceived risks. "I was terribly disappointed but not surprised by leadership," one of Game File's sources said. "They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political ‘status quo’ and take no stand, no risk, even creative."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's handling of the Yasuke controversy was rather topsy-turvy, with Shadows developers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defending their work</a> while managment types like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">CEO Yves Guillemot</a> tried to pull the old 'no politics here in a video game, please stop thinking we might have thoughts to express in this video game' cop-out.</p><p>It's not like the company hasn't backed games that tackled issues like slavery before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, the beloved entry that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">reportedly getting the remake or remaster tratement at the moment</a>, span-off into Freedom Cry, which tells the tale of former slave Adewale fighting to free slaves in Saint-Domingue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-liberation">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</a> deals with similar themes, as you'd expect when making games set in periods of history when colonialism and its effects had a big impact on society and folks' everyday lives.</p>
<p>You can perhaps understand the risk aversion if you only look at the bottom line, but it's depressing to see a game spoken enthusiastically about by its developers be lobbed out of the window because of the state of affairs in modern day America. If anything, that would have made releasing a game exploring these themes even more important and commendable.</p>
