With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> having received an indefinite delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">back in June</a>, that just leaves one game to test whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. While this one has been cooking for a while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-prepares-to-stake-its-claim-in-making-extraction-shooters-popular-with-an-october-release-date">it actually has a release date</a>, October 30th. There's been a few tests along the way, and it turns out the devs have one last one in them!
</p>
<p>
The good thing about this test - they're calling it a Server Slam - is that it's completely open to everyone. You don't need any kind of access code, and despite this announcement coming with the shooter's pre-order trailer, you do not in fact have to pre-order it either. This test is taking place between October 17th and 19th, across PC and console, and essentially it's just to get as many people playing as possible to ensure there are no server hiccups when the game actually launches.

Apparently this test will take place on the Dam Battlegrounds map for those in the know, and you'll be able to get a taste of the game's progression, crafting, and quest systems. It's worth noting that none of this progress will carry over to the full game, so don't get too deep into it. You'll get a backpack cosmetic as a little treat in the full game for your troubles at least.
</p><p>
I've said it before on this site and I'll say it again, I'm not particularly big on shooters, but I'm always curious about a burgeoning genre or subgenre. Sure extraction shooters aren't exactly new, but they are quite hard to recommend given how easy it can be to lose progress. Not sure if I'll be jumping in at launch, though I'll be keeping my eye on it to see how things go at least.

<p>
Arc Raiders is out October 30th.

            <p>
Fancy a kickabout? After launching in the much warmer June (why is it already so cold, it's only bloody September), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a> has finally received its first proper season, elevating it into a true, blue live service game. This comes with, as you may have guessed, a season pass, which comes with a pair of themes for your football stadium, one being iceberg oriented, the other providing a volcanic atmosphere, alongside some new cosmetics too.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the season pass, there are two pretty big additions with this update. First up is crossplay! You know how this works I'm sure, but to spell it out, it means those of you on PC will now be able to play with your console friends, whether you own the game on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. Always a neat thing to have! Then, there's the addition of a 3v3 ranked mode. Typically matches are 5v5, so this will obviously make for a mode with some tactical differences. Sort of like heading to the local park with your mates!

This season also brings some fixes and tweaks through a new patch too. Reactivity and precision should be better now, and whatever the exploit known as the "Ippy Slide" has been nerfed too. Yay? You'll also find that goalkeeper dives have received a rework so that they're more effective against volleys, and as detailed in a press release, "skill-based matchmaking parameters are now stricter, especially in ranked matches, ensuring more evenly matched teams."
</p><p>
Apparently season 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game will also introduce a much more personal 1v1 game mode, and throughout 2026 there'll be new features introduced like clubs and tournaments systems, World Cup-themed events, and "more." Look forward to that, I suppose!
