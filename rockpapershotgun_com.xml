Keita Takahashi is probably one of the most recognizable names in games, in no small part thanks to a game that needs no introduction, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>. That game was made at Namco, before it became the Bandai Namco we know today, and Takahashi actually left the studio back in 2006 around the time they merged, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>), the developer has shared the reason behind his departure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"I left the company because I didn’t want to be limited to only working with the people there," Takahashi quite plainly put it. "I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people. I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives. I’m currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."
</p>
<p>
Takahashi is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> at his studio Uvula, a quite lovely looking game that looks to explore disability and the small difficulties that come in daily life in his usual, quirky way. Despite working with a more global team these days, he did admit that he doesn't know "what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements" in to a T. 
</p>
<p>
He still thinks that there'll be something for everyone in the game though, as the main character doesn't want to go to school because they're being bullied, and Takahashi thinks that "this is something that happens worldwide, not just in Japan. I was actually bullied myself, and never felt like going to school."
</p>
<p>
I enjoy Takahashi's work a lot, Katamari is a game I'd recommend to probably anyone, and Wattam was a delight too, weirdness and all. Whether I'm the target audience or not doesn't seem to matter much to Takahashi either as he said: "I make games that I feel satisfied with, so I’d like people to play them if they want to. I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I’ll work on that in my next life." Quite happy that he's making the games he is in this one myself.
</p>
<p>
To a T is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">due out May 28th</a>.

            <p>
I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I love <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>. It was actually the first game I played in the series, and when I did I wasn't aware that it wasn't universally loved or even liked at its release. Not that knowing other people's opinions would have changed my mind about it, I'm the kind of person that will ardently defend a 6/10, but still, I think there's a lot to love about it… unless you played the game on PC. For a long time, it was missing a few things that were featured in the PS2 version of the game, but GOG's Preservation Program is adding them back in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For those of you that never got to Silent Hill 4, the thing that sort of sets it apart from the other games in the series was that you had a sort of hub area, your apartment, where you could go back to intermittently to save and rest for a moment. It's meant to be a safe zone of sorts, but after a while hauntings start happening, unsettling events like windows getting rattled, finding a dead cat in your fridge, or your kitchen faucet pouring out blood. It was a great way of keeping you on your toes, even in a supposed safe area, except a handful of them were missing from the PC version, despite being present in the code.

<p>
GOG essentially just switched them back on, but I'm sure I'm being very reductive about something that was probably a good bit of hard work. On top of bringing these hauntings back, the PC version on GOG will work better on modern hardware, and there's even modern controller support, meaning you can bust out your DualSense (and more) if that's your weapon of choice.
</p>
<p>
I know everyone's been buzzing about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> recently, and last year brought us Bloober's remake of 2, but I really do think you should give 4 a go. The second half is sort of one long escort mission for a character Eileen, though she's honestly a really likeable companion character - I often think about a line of hers where she says "Considering the circumstances, I guess we're doing pretty good, huh" that just feels so human in a way you don't see very often. Get on it, especially considering it's <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/silent_hill_4_the_room">only a fiver right now</a>.
