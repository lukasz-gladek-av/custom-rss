            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-throne">Nuclear Throne</a> is one of those games that will always be at least just a little bit relevant, in some shape or form. There are other indie games I'd rather play more than it from its era, but it kind of feels like the best representation of that period in indie games too. Throwback pixel art, a unique spin on both bullet hells and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>, a bangin' soundtrack, it's got the right mix of things to help it stand the test of time. And here we are now, the game approaching its 10th anniversary, arriving with a new update.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
To be specific, it's a new beta build, so it's only there if you want to try it out, but it is available right now. Don't go expecting massive features or additions or anything though, this is a quality of life update. To that end, here's what it includes! For starters there's now 60 or 120fps support, for those of you that care about that sort of thing (look, most games just don't need 60fps, alright).

There's also new aspect ratios, and a new controls menu too, but to find out the exact changes there you'll have to take a look for yourself. "Oh, and a new Melting loading screen tip", the post rounds off, alongside a very cool emoji wearing sunglasses.
</p>
<p>
If you want access to this update, your steps are pretty simple: right click on Nuclear Throne in your Steam library, click properties, then betas, then select "openbeta_win64", and Bob's your uncle, the update is ready and waiting for you.
</p>
<p>
Vlambeer explain in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/242680/view/528724684296945991?l=english">Steam post</a> announcing the update that they plan to add all these improvements into the main game too, as well as more than what's mentioned above, so don't feel like you have to rush for it.

            <p>Sloclap‚Äôs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-foot-to-ball-visualisation">foot-to-ball</a> game Rematch is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">very good</a>, and has been doing very well, with over three million sales to date, but some of us yet grieve for a time when kicks were reserved for torsos and limbs. Which is to say, some of us have been hoping that Sloclap might return to the martial arts realm in which it has hitherto made waves.</p> <!--more-->
<p>If it happens, it will not happen in the form of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> 2 or even a sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a>, Sloclap‚Äôs chain-punching debut. For you see, creative director Pierre Tarno is of the opinion that ‚Äúchasing safe bets is a death sentence‚Äù and that "gamers are on the lookout for new, original experiences." He‚Äôs got better things to do than develop sequels, and I‚Äôm sure no video game publishers brandishing huge sacks of rubies will persuade him otherwise.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs from a new Edge interview sliced into sandwich-sized slablets by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/as-rematch-fires-past-3-million-players-devs-say-they-werent-planning-to-follow-up-their-cult-kung-fu-game-sifu-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence/">Gamesradar</a>. According to Tarno, he pitched Rematch way back in 2021, but the studio were too small at the time to handle more than one project, and Sifu won the coin toss. Still, Sloclap were already prototyping the football game almost a year before Sifu‚Äôs release.</p>
<p>Again, Rematch has done very well. Extraordinarily well, for a game braving a sports genre dominated by essentially one series, the artist formerly known as FIFA. I‚Äôve enjoyed what I‚Äôve played of it ‚Äì you can feel the dev‚Äôs past games in the tuned-up leather-walloping SFX, which make EA Sports FC seem anodyne. I also enjoy that, for all the souped-up holographic stadiums, each match is basically a neighbourhood kickabout with loosened rules and no referee.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn‚Äôt mind playing another Absolver, or some other, very stylish experience in which feet are a means of speedy jaw removal rather than being used to abuse innocent, air-filled orbs. Hmm, what other things can you kick? I do kick this computer now and then when I'm doing my tax returns, but I'm not sure you could get a whole game out of that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sifu-2-says-rematch-dev-because-chasing-safe-bets-is-a-death-sentence]]></content:encoded>

            <p>This article on a free update for train factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> Railgrade is the absolute height of presumption, for we have never actually covered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/railgrade">Railgrade</a> before, even though it came out ONE MILLION YEARS AGO in October 2023.</p>
<p>I cannot hear your cries of outrage and scorn, however, for my ears are filled with the otherworldly whistle of speeding locomotives. The locos wail to me of a brand new campaign encompassing 11 missions and nine hours of playtime. Did you play Railgrade? Do you wish there were more of it? Well, stop carping about our spotty coverage and get this patch down your trousers, then.</p><!--more-->
<p>The campaign in question is Rapid Repo Rescue. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1355090/view/803443087671039134?l=english">detailed on Steam</a>, it takes you to a brand new colony planet except that, oops, it turns out the colony ship accidentally landed on a planet owned by a rival corporation. As such, you'll now need to rush-develop a factory network in order to recharge your space launcher before the legal goons arrive and suitcase the entire site from orbit.</p>
<p>The new campaign is the work of a Railgrade player, Mortiz, who is currently studying at university. Railgrade devs Minakata Dynamics commissioned him - in the form of cash, scandalously enough, rather than the standard creative industry currency of exposure - in light of his past work for the mapmaking community. A few Discord group members have pitched in with playtesting, seemingly for free. I frown upon devs who enlist their players as unpaid testers, but in fairness, this appears to have been a more informal community production.</p>
<p>If you own Railgrade, you'll find Rapid Repo Rescue on the bonus campaign menu. "We gave Mortiz access to every yet-unused asset in the game," lead programmer Daniel Dressler notes. "This meant new trains, new industry, and new resources." The latter bits include "a Natural Gas &amp; Hydrogen set of energy production chains", a new Gas Powerplant, and Offshore Gas Wells.</p>
<p>If you never played Railgrade, because you think trains are the work of the Devil, you may be more interested in the developer's forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">Whiskerwood</a>. It's about building factory-colonies of mice and sending shipments of goods to villainous cats overseas - a pleasantly concussed reimagining of European colonialism, plus jolly pirate ships. We'll try to write about that one when it actually comes out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cool-train-strategy-game-railgrade-gets-a-free-campaign-about-escaping-a-rival-corporations-planet]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, so, you've read the headline. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> mod that adds a rubbish chute to Megabuilding H10 with full animations and everything, so that you can exit V's default flat via a big slide down to ground level.</p>
<p>It's a totally unnecessary thing for someone to have spend time adding to a video game. It's a totally unnecessary thing for a person to download and add to a video game they've bought. It's also totally glorious, to the point that none of that other stuff matters a jot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's called (clears throat) <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22334?tab=description">"Weeee"</a>, and is the work of prolific Cyberpunk modder Phil 'Deceptious' Wright. If you've modded Cyberpunk at any point over the years, odds are you've given any number of their more advanced works a look, with these including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11590">revamped romances</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7833">custom quests</a>, and a whole new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/18223">intro/backstory option</a>.</p>
<p>All of that stuff's really impressive, especially given that most of it relies on community-developed tools that modders have made to let them bend a game with notorious bug potential to their will without breaking it. At the same time, as a mod user, I get just as much of a kick out of seeing all that expertise turned on something that's just for a laugh.</p>

<p>Enter the trash slide. It's a very simple and goofy premise, but it's been put together like the Mona Lisa of gags. There's a full animation that plays just as seamlessly as any of the base game's every time you slide down from the atrium of the Megabuilding, and transitions into a satisfying thunk as you land in a pile of binbags. There's a ladder neatly tucked away to get you down to street level from there, so you aren't limited to jumping down and breaking your cyber ankles.</p>
<p>For a big yellow slide tacked to the side of a building, the chute's not so in-your-face as to take you out of the wider Cyberpunk experience. It's goofy in practice, but I could easily see myself incorporating it into the backstory of a quirky character who doesn't like lifts.</p>
<p>CD Projekt could add an exact copy of this to the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">their next patch</a> and you'd not feel like their standards had slipped one bit. I love jank in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">jokey modding antics</a> as much as anyone. It's often a huge part of the charm, knowing for sure that a human had a laugh making this because they've cocked it up a bit. However, there's something to be said for tomfoolery that's executed with the deft touch and elegance of the finest Shakespearian knob gag.</p>
<p>If you want to try the slide, you'll need to grab its requirements, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, because as I stressed, this is advanced modding at its finest.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, the troubled sequel to dino husbandry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, will "hopefully" launch into early access by 2027, according to Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz. The key question appears to be when to shift the focus away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the original Ark's Unreal Engine 5 revamp, which launched in early access in 2023. Also, designing a Soulslike combat system is hard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">PCGamesN</a>, Stieglitz explained that Studio Wildcard had a vertical slice (loosely defined, a demo that shows off all aspects of the final game) for Ark 2 prior to Survival Ascended's launch. But the devs "felt that as a team, it would be very difficult to follow that all the way through to a complete game with both our experience level and [our scope] as a company". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz says the developers needed to get their heads around Unreal Engine 5 before taking a swing at Ark 2, and in particular, its new Soulslicorice combat system. "It's very difficult to do soulslike combat in a multiplayer PvP context," Stieglitz went on. "You could probably count the number of games on one hand that have even attempted that in an actual PvP context."
</p>
<p>(FromSofties may be in uproar over this last claim - in his defence, Stieglitz is presumably referring to games like Ark that allow dozens of players per public session. Still, by all means count up the alternatives and prove him wrong. I'd do it but I need both these hands to type with.)</p>
<p>
Right now, "a small portion" of Studio Wildcard are working to "refine" the mechanics of that old Ark 2 vertical slice. Stieglitz reckons it'll take "18 months of hardcore team focus to [turn] that vertical slice into an early access game, when we get to put the vast majority of our team back on it." He thinks Ark 2 will launch into early access "hopefully within the next two years", but it all depends on when Studio Wildcard decide to shift their efforts away from Survival Ascended.
</p>
<p>
Aside from dancing the Soulslike Fantastic with the new brontosaurus-punching mechanics, Studio Wildcard intend to feature proper NPC antagonists in Ark 2, "because that's been implied by the trailer and has been part of our design for quite some time as an opposing force, so to speak". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz wants to "add a lot more threat level to the environment and the feeling of being able to enjoy a PvP-like experience, even without [fighting against other players]." He's also gunning for a user-generated content system that works more "seamlessly under the hood while you're playing the game", rather than being presented as a menu.
</p>
<p>
Survival Evolved players may not be too tickled to hear of the present commitment to Survival Ascended. The Unreal Engine revamp launched in October 2023 with some new creatures and structures, but without much of Survival Evolved's expansion content. In the process, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-evolveds-official-servers-switch-off-in-just-a-few-hours-paving-the-way-for-remake">took the original game's servers offline</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As the developers have hitherto made plain, Ascended exists in large part to fund Ark 2's development, not just help them cut their teeth on a new engine or git gud at parrying. Initially, they were planning to launch it in a bundle with a $50 Ark 2 pre-order, but players swarmed the comms like testy oviraptors, and the developers ultimately released Ascended by itself for $45, before launch discounts. It now has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">a DLC roadmap that runs till end of 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad blood continues to swirl. Steam user reviews for Ascended remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/#app_reviews_hash">mixed</a>, and the original Ark <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">has more players on Steam right now</a>, despite the loss of official server support. Still, I'm sure Studio Wildcard will keep plugging on with it, because after all, confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as...
