            <p>I once got in a heated debate with Graham over whether the chest-high walls in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series could accurately be called 'massive'. The Gears men are massive, I argued. So it stands to reason that any wall that could provide adequate bullet cover to a massive man must itself be a massive wall. No, said Graham. They're famously normal size walls, hence why the massive men have to squat down like they've just had a bowling ball lobbed at their kidneys. Well, we can finally examine the true scale of these walls - in 4K no less - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears Of War: Reloaded</a>. A "faithfully remastered" version of the 2006 large man <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>, coming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/">to Steam on August 26th</a> this year.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a trailer so enjoy this extremely old one and just imagine it looks nicer. Bit nicer. Little bit nicer. That's it, now you're thinking like a customer!</p>

<p>The announcement was announced by the announcement professionals at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">Xbox Wire</a>. It'll be $40 to buy, and also available on that game subscription service you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections"> may or may not want to support right now</a>. The blog mentions "split screen" although doesn't use the words "local co-op" specifically. Reloaded has "the full breadth of content from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>", itself a remaster with some added bonuses, namely the five extra chapters previously exclusive to the original Windows release. Here are some Gamer Stats for you, gamer:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>My claim to fame is that I'm one of the seven people in the world that had played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Switch_(video_game)#Legacy">Kill Switch</a> prior to the original Gears. That's the 2003 PS2 game that effectively invented the contemporary cover shooter, complete with blindfire. If anything needed a modern remaster, that feels like the far more important project to me, essential piece of gaming history that it is. It's <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/kill-switch-e3s">currently available as abandonware</a> if you're curious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
