            <p>It'll soon be time for another season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the super-duper Overwotlike and thirsty delivery vehicle for every variation of Marvel character known to the human mind. What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hera, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbioties, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom.</p>
<p>All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling "Marks &amp; Spencers opening times", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in.</p><!--more-->

<p>How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuZZzvJxR8">itching for the dance floor</a>. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night."</p> </blockquote>
<p>"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/massive-marvel-rivals-leak-confirms-season-3-theme-with-new-hero-battle-pass-and-more/">leaks suggest</a> that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some "anti-heal" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment.</p>
<p>We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-and-phoenix-are-coming-to-marvel-rivals-this-july-in-season-3-along-with-rumoured-anti-heal-mechanics]]></content:encoded>
