            <p>What would do, oh what would you do?</p>
<p>Yes, what would <em>you</em> do, with an infinite shoe?</p>
<p>Would you melt it to make yourself infinite glue?</p>
<p>Or to infinite dogs 'pon which to infinitely chew?</p>
<p>Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I'm very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me <em>rhyming cancer</em>. Also, the urge to browse the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> mods, to see what players of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/popularalltime?nav=1&amp;page_size=15&amp;page=2">Nexus Mods page</a> where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game <em>in theory</em>, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.</p>

<p>The two most popular mods are currently one for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14">infinite saving</a> (see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ware-ye-this-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-crash-bug-that-cost-me-hours-of-progress">Edwin's experience for frustrating context</a>) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32">instant herb picking</a> ("We all know how good Henry is at his leg day game, but we’ve seen this animation enough times"). Right next to that are mods to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59">stay clean for longer</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/63">carry more stuff</a>. Less pesky simulation, basically, and very similar to the most popular mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance?tab=popular+%28all+time%29">for the first game</a>. A bit further down is my favourite one though, tied closely with this "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/12">totally unnecessary reticle for bows and crossbows</a>".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/125">Infinite shoe durability</a> does what it says on the shoebox - disabling the wear and tear Henry accumulates on his footwear while gallivanting around the Bohemian wilderness, and so eliminating the need to replace or repair his favourite pair. To me, this is both a little baffling (again, surely you play a game like KC:D II for this kind of frictive minutiae), but also very funny, simply because I find the idea of infinite shoes very funny.</p>
<p>So, this is a call out. The first person to mod a quest into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> II where Henry meets the fabled Infinite Cobbler gets my kingdom, my horse, and one pair of my actual, finite shoes. There wasn't a massive quest modding scene for the first game, mind. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1101">The Cuman War mod</a> allowed you to fight repeatable battles all over the map, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958">Architect mod</a> added base-building features, but otherwise the modding tools available don't seem to have been conducive to something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s many fan-made stories. Ah well, we'll always have those shoes at least.</p>
<p>"Warhorse's historical open world RPG makes Elder Scrolls feel shallow," wrote Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">in his review</a>, "but its deft feudal portrayal is checked by the routine boy's fable at its core".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Comicbook mulchfest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> once planned to reset player ranks twice per season, but these recently-hatched plots are no more, for the gamers have descended upon NetEase like rogue Iron Man suits, and the developers have acquiesced to their verbal kicks and punches.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, NetEase <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">announced</a> that they would reset player ranks on 21st February to inaugurate the second half of the hero shooter's first season. The idea was to "shake up the battlefield" alongside the arrival of new characters The Thing and Human Torch plus some "major balance adjustments". Specifically, players were told to expect a rank drop of four divisions, in order that they might rank-up afresh to unlock new rewards such as costumes and crests.
</p>
<p>
"After careful observations and consideration, we have concluded that players' ranks during the first half of Season 1 are the best indicator of their competitive skills within the season," the devs wrote. "So, we will be introducing additional rank reset to better align with the upcoming content and changes!"
</p>
<p>
That jovial exclamation mark was a provocation too far. Like wrathful yet relatively articulate Hulks, the players took to their keyboards and filled social media and Reddit with their outrage. I don't truck much with Marvel Rivals at the minute but I can understand the complaints: imposing rank resets at this frequency forces players to pump in more time to earn the game's digital trinkets. It feels like a cheap and dirty way of driving up Engagement, the worst Marvel supervillain of all.
</p>
<p>
NetEase have heard the cries of the faithful, and are rolling back the changes. "After the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community," reads a conciliatory note, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">issued today</a>. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable." 
</p>
<p>
 As such, there will no longer be a rank reset when the second half of season 1 begins on 21st February. If you're already max rank and you want to earn rewards in the remainder of season 1, you'll simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet "the relevant conditions".
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals remains popular despite these fan skirmishes. It's 7th on the Steam Most Played chart at the time of writing, vying with hardy perennials <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and the Wallpaper Engine for its place in the top 10. I haven't played not so much for lack of enjoyment but because the last time I did the chibi shark kept eating me, and I felt bad about myself.

            <p>Torch-trembling spook 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is getting a new map some time this year, say developers Kinetic Games. It'll be a small one, about the size of one of the haunted houses that make up the co-op horror's roster of cosier locations. And that decision to build small is going to be the plan from now on. No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For future Phasmophobia maps, we’ll be keeping the size relatively small," said Kinetic in <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap">a blog post showing their 2025 roadmap</a>. "This’ll allow us to release more maps, more regularly rather than fewer larger maps."</p>
<p>As for the new map, they haven't revealed its exact setting yet. </p>
<p>"We’re keeping details close to our collective chests, but we can reveal it will be a small map - akin to the houses - in a location that’ll be totally unique to anything we’ve done in Phasmophobia up until now. We’ll share more later this year..."</p>
<p>Hmmm. Mysterious, as befits a ghostly gang. But they did talk about other plans, including reworks to three existing maps: the Bleasdale Farmhouse, Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. Bleasdale will be the first to be refurbished, and that'll arrive in a March update. They also show a "work-in-progress" screenshot of one of the rooms. </p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them," said Kinetic. "So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however."</p>
<p>The last time ghost hunters saw a new location was in June last year, when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/6215608421522854557">a lighthouse was added to the lineup</a>. Previous map additions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3360267827388792766">came in September 2022</a> - the flickering fires of Camp Woodwind the Sunny Meadows Mental Institustion (one of the only two "large" maps in the game). A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobias-prison-map-is-here-and-ive-already-been-spooked">bewraithed prison was added</a> back in 2020. .</p>
<p>The roadmap discusses other plans, so it's worth a look if you're a Phasmophiend. The game will see a visual overhaul of player characters, for example, and a more satisfying way of noting evidence of ghostly goings-ons in your journal. There'll also be a repeat of the seasonal events the game has been doing since 2022. Looking much further ahead, they say there'll be more new maps in 2026.</p>
<p>I have only played this freak fest for family 'n' friends a couple of times, diving in with a pal and his crack squad of hunters. I had no idea how to use any of the equipment, while they were all seasoned experts. It was like being the idiot reporter embedded in a SWAT team. I was escorted around by the hand before being led to a closet and told to wait. I was discovered and killed by a terrible, unknowable, unimaginable being. "This is the reason Phasmophobia is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">our best co-op games</a>," I did not think, because, as I say, I was deceased. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It is I, the guy who has only played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> playing his second autobattler, and getting strong Mechabellum vibes from it. Except, actually no, not at all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/he-is-coming">He Is Coming</a>, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.</p>
<p>Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.</p>

<p>The first thing I get is a sword named 'heartdrinker', which restores one health on a hit. Am I invincible already? Have I won?<em> Then</em> I find an anvil that gives me a 'deal two thorns and take one damage' upgrade to my sword. Will this pair up nicely with my health regen? It absolutely does not. I'm getting battered. The next wolf I fight eats my feet and I die miserably. The game doesn't say "a wolf eats your feet" or anything, but that's what I imagine happened. Wolf's gotta eat.</p>
<p>But what's this! Meta progression between runs! Equipment I unlock by meeting certain criteria, the first of which is simply dying? This, I like. Meta progression in roguelikes is universally good and I'll hear no argument to the contrary (I am actually interested in hearing argument to the contrary).</p>
<p>I trundle around for a bit. Quite a lot of the joy early on is just discovering what all the event nodes do, so I hope this extends long past <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824490/He_is_Coming/">the Steam demo</a>. You might find a font of oil that buffs your sword, or a fairy than can transform equipment. You might just find hedgehogs. I keep killing hedgehogs in a single hit and feeling nothing. Am I broken? My icon shows a knight but I start with a stick? Is this a Don Quixote simulator? How would Don Quixote feel about killing hedgehogs? So many questions. Let's look at Steam for answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long-forgotten enemy rises and brings portents of doom – the Demon King is coming, and without a champion to strike him down, the world will surely fall to his corruption. Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that settles it: it's a Sokoban, and it's out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I don't play many visual novels, but I've played enough to know that Of The Devil is hot. Hot like the sizzle of rain through a neon signboard as a dull-eyed redhead walks into a cyberpunk police station at 3am and starts throwing around Chandlerisms like she's boiling an egg - <em>and you're the egg</em>. "Information's like cash in my line of work," says the dame, who is a freelance lawyer called Morgan. "You've got to spend it to make it." She sizes up the holographic front desk, with its sprinkling of things to OBSERVE. "Let's see if I can't poke around and shake some change loose."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If you hate purpulp detective fiction you may have already clicked away, in which case: up yours, Jerky McJerkface, I never liked you anyway. If you're still here, you may be relieved to learn that Of The Devil is capable of taking the piss out of itself, though this is far from parody. For example, one of the first objects you can OBSERVE is a datapad containing a corporate press release which Morgan - whose opening narration muses upon a "slight blunting of the night's ambience, emphasis on the slight" - dismisses as "flowery". One of the first things you can have her do is forget her own date of birth.

The more indulgent noir flourishes also dissipate as you push on with Morgan's task, which is to defend a guy who has seemingly been caught bang to rights for murdering his girlfriend. You interview a couple of classically mismatched detectives - a lanky whimsical oldster and a snarling young gun with an eyepatch. You use your phone's AR functionality to comb a hot pink projection of the crime scene. The near-future setting takes shape in a glittery wash of allusions to experimental androids and surveillance and unjust laws. The dialogue becomes almost steely.</p><p>As you talk and probe and deduce, filling out your phone's casefiles, you earn casino chips which you'll eventually play in interrogation sequences that resemble high-octane collectible card games. Yes, that line about information being a currency was a tutorial, actually.

Even when the writing is laying it on thick, Of The Devil gets away with it because the visuals and audio are a blast. The presentation recalls <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>: fixed-perspective 3D environments, 2D character art and a very dishy interface, with a music player pulsing away in top right. The characters are rakish, crazy-eyed confections with an efficient spread of expressions and changes of posture. While there's no voice-acting, they each get their own pitch of digital typewriter noise during dialogue, which is one of those well-worn, conceptually simple tricks that never fails to delight me.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/">Find Of The Devil on Steam</a>. I played the first free prologue chapter this morning for an hour and it really feels like a goer - as cool as the moon reflecting from an android's bum through the smoke from a cigarette kindled on the wrong side of a one-way-street.</p>
<p>It's a pay-per-episode format, with one paid episode available so far. To repeat a cry oftenheard around these parts of late, I don't know if we have the resources to review it, but I intend to play more. Thanks very much to freelance scribe Autumn Wright for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lhpsptjcic2o">spotting the game and boosting it on Bluesky</a>.
