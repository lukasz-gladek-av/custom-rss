What do you think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islands-and-trains">Islands &amp; Trains</a> is about? I'm not going to give you long, because it really is just right there in the name. As you've presumably already guessed, it is a quaint-looking sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> where you make tiny diorama-like islands, adorning them with tracks for trains to choo-choo along. I told you, it's a name that does what it says on the tin, and if it appeals to you at all, well, there's some good news, as it just came out today.
</p>

<p>
Islands &amp; Trains for the most part looks like one of those kind of build-your-own screensaver type of games, without the screen saving part. Developer Akos Makovics specifically cited games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> as influences, all titles with a focus on making peaceful places to look at with a hopeful sense of ease. So, if they're up your alley, this one probably will be too.

There's apparently over 400 types of tiles to play around with, lots of variations amongst those too, and you'll notice animals like cows and ducks flocking in as you build up your city. I'm not typically a sandbox builder kind of person myself, and yet looking at it I can't help but harken back to my own childhood playing with my dad's model railway. 
</p>
<p>
He wasn't the kind of model train enthusiast that had all the extremities like sets and tiny trees, so imagination was key to building up a picture. Islands &amp; Trains looks like a nice opportunity to express that childlike sense of train-oriented curiosity. You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/">Steam</a> right now if it takes your fancy.

            <p>A modder is asking for help resurrecting Borderlands Online, an MMO version of Gearbox's comedy gun-runner that only ever saw daylight in China. It was announced in 2014 and shut down in 2015 alongside development studio 2K China, but footage of the abandoned project appeared online earlier this year. Now, intrepid digital archaeologist EpicNNG is trying to overcome "thousands of errors" and restore the MMO to a playable state.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can hear about these mighty ventures in the latest update video, below. The build EpicNNG is working with "has been publicly available for the past 10 years", but was only recently discovered by another modder, Lewis, with the cautionary note that "a lot of the downloads were riddled with viruses". They've now confirmed that "we have got the full game" and "can get in eventually, it is just a matter of when".</p>

<p>That's providing, however, other people pitch in, and EpicNNG is concerned that Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games or Gearbox might block the project ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. "God forbid that happens here, and this gets shut down, and I receive a cease and desist because we're taking away from the marketing of Borderlands 4," the video frets. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, we covered a Stop Killing Games survey which held that around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games with online requirements are doomed</a>. Here's hoping this one returns from the abyss. It's the first I've heard of the Borderlands MMO, and while I've fallen off the series, I'm curious to see how the developers at 2K China reworked the fittings.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">launches on 12th September</a>. Gearbox frontman Randy Pitchford has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">saying daft things about it</a>. He does so love doing that.

            <p>
Day one patches are the curse that comes with the modern age of video games because development doesn't end at the point of printing the discs we play them on any more. It sucks, it's bad for preservation, but we're stuck with them. However, it's also a bit funny that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, due out tomorrow, May 30th, sort of has a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">day minus one patch that's already available</a>. Of course, unless you're a journalist, YouTuber, or very friendly with your local video game store clerk who hooked you up with an early copy of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a>, this won't concern you for a good few hours yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The patch notes are also just incredibly useless. Here's the full list of them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be fair, the only one that might be of any interest to you or I are those new character scenarios, and the fun part about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> game is discovering those sorts of things for yourself. Or, you know, watching a YouTube video explaining the lore to you because you're an adult with a soul crushing job and you don't have time to play and think about the games you're playing.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's something more important that's related to Nightreign I want to draw your attention to: a trailer that genuinely, no word of a life, features Evanescence's Bring Me to Life. There is not a single part of my soul that understands how this could have come about, I'm just going to thank the universe that we're moving past considering the 2000s a time solely full of cringe.

If you've been wondering whether Elden Ring Nightreign is any good, well, that does depend on who you ask, but our own Nic had some slightly complicated feelings about it in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a>.
