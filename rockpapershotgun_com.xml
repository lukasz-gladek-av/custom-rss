            <p>I was nosing around for a feelgood story to perk you up after this morning's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">depresso</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-goodbye-to-nic-reuben-chief-librarian-and-rps-staff-writer">news</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announce-mass-layoffs-with-over-100-uk-staff-reportedly-expected-to-be-at-risk">stew</a>. But then I thought: what have you done for me lately? So instead, we're going to write up the release of Diggergun, a life sim platform game about burrowing for lithium, in which you lose a portion of your take-home pay to costs based on real-world current UK tax, national insurance, debt and household expenses. Glorious! That'll teach you to show up here, expecting some kind of escapism.</p><!--more-->
<p>In my defence, it seems possible for Diggergun to become more of a feelgood game if all of the aforesaid realworld statistics improve. But I'm not sure this will ever transform into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wandersong">Wandersong</a>, exactly. One of the first things I did in the Steam demo was develop symptoms of what I assume is lithium poisoning. There may also be supernatural threats ahead: white eyes in the dark, and little green men (self-described, anyway - the visuals are monochrome) who talk of ancient evils below. Is a Balrog worse than the cost-of-living crisis? This we may discover.</p>

<p>As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, you start the game owing a hefty sum to a giant corporation, the operators of a weird Cornish mining operation on the isolated and therefore, unregulated Bal Island. To pay off the debt - or so you're told by your employers - you must jump and gun-dig through a "diverse range of randomly generated mines and intricately hand-designed levels", all of them presented as 2D platters of destructible blocks, gems and hostile critters. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> but with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minit">Minit</a>'s art direction, and each floor is (so far) more of a single-screen puzzle than a procedural ecology.</p><p>You're bound by an energy gauge that decreases for every floor you descend, and punishes you in various ways for overdoing it. You can deposit your lithium load and return to the surface by heading to the exit on each level. Also on the surface: a gloomy town's worth of miners, managers, loansharks and shabby apartments, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tristram">Tristram</a> if it were founded by Weyland-Yutani. There are people here you can bond with to pursue a multiple-ending storyline. I feel like my best friends so far are the toilet and shower in my apartment, which restore a precious point of energy apiece.</p>
<p>Diggergun is the work of solo developer Kabloop, and has an autobiographical underbelly. "I started working on the game three years ago, after a very unpleasant experience working at a video game publisher," the developer told me over email. "Something I didn't expect was that Diggergun's themes about workers rights and the minimum wage have become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/03/nigel-farage-reform-uk-economic-policy">more relevant today</a> than when I started." </p>
<p>"Whilst things are looking bleak, it's my hope that Diggergun can be a part of a much needed discussion about workers rights, and our duty of care to one another," the dev went on. "As opposed to ranting at people, my game attempts to highlight its themes through its emergent gameplay. For example, if the player does their job correctly they're rewarded with more work... something I'm sure we can all relate to."</p>
<p>If all this sounds <em>too</em> relatable, know that the game has some uncomplicated upsides. The setting is pleasantly mysterious and there's some wonderful audio design. Signboard text unfurls with a warble of Morse code, and your character makes a digital plinky-plonk noise when they walk that I found immediately endearing. Still, none of that's going to pay the rent. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968180/DIGGERGUN/">Find out more on Steam.</a></p>

            <p>Amid announcing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">delay</a> during their latest earnings call, Take-Two also raised a glass to comparatively less earth-shatteringly huge crime committer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. As it turns out, there's enough of an appetite for more "contained" tales sold at a lower price point than the usual all-singing, all-dancing affairs big publishers keep pushing more and more of their eggs into the baskets of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said the Sicilian sojourn convincingly outperformed expectations, putting to be any questions about the series' future, at least for now. "What we suspected was confirmed," the exec told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. "Which is just...if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result."</p>
<p>While I'm not sure I'd go too over the top in congratulating Take-Two for taking the unprecedented gamble of, er, not having every game be a massive, unwieldy beast which is expected to deliver the GDP of a decently-sized country just to not be a branded a faliure, it's nice to see The Old Country's approach did pay off.</p>
<p>As I said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">my review</a>, it's a path I was glad to see Hangar 13 take, even if in my estimation the short Mafia romp they ended up creating is a bit too by-the-numbers narrative-wise and could maybe have to done more to blend both the old and the new into its pint-sized soup. If you're prepared to accept caveats like those going in, it's well worth picking up for a fun weekend or so of chases in old timey cars and people talking about oaths of omerta.</p><p>I'd certainly not want every game I played to set its sights on only being the sort of thing The Old Country is, but it's important that games like it keep on getting made, because there'll always be a place for them. Here's hoping Take-Two don't turn around and forget that the moment they finish their celebratory wine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another of the corp's summer releases, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, didn't have any beverages cracked open for it. Instead, Zelnick cited it as having faired less well than planned this far, something the company are blaming on the technical issues which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">plagued its PC version early doors</a>. What that in mind, they expect a game that conformtably had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">biggest US launch</a> in its series' history to pick up going forwards. This industry, man.</p>

            <p>You’ve probably noticed that there’s been only a sporadic amount of Nic Reuben in your RPS lately, and we’re sad to say that Nic is leaving the treehouse to resume his glittering freelance career. Please join us in saying goodbye and wishing him well before he jets off on his solid rhodium pleasure plane, never to return (unless we ask him very nicely to review a Warhammer game or something).</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>James:</strong> I distinctly remember, when Nic joined RPS, a feeling of not quite believing our luck. We were bruised at the time from several painful team losses and yet in the space of less than a year, managed to nab both Edwin <em>and</em> Nic, two of the best free agents in the gamewords business. Proper pinch-me stuff. Once in the staff writer chair, he immediately established himself as the best kind of crewmate: not just an excellent person with bottomless wells of empathy and humour, but a writer so damned good that he made everyone around him better. Through, like, talent osmosis. And he didn’t even realise he was doing it.</p>
<p>I can’t list all his best stuff because we’d be here for months. But even before he started at RPS full-time, he was exhibiting a profound skill of looking at games in interesting and unusual ways, like his now-famous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">study of Elden Ring’s pot boy</a>. Or later, an investigation into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">medieval soundscape of Manor Lords</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-uk-games-industry-has-a-class-problem-heres-how-one-organisation-is-trying-to-fix-it">picking out the class issues in a whole bunch of stuff</a>. Or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/object-ive-review">Object-ive Review</a>, his Supporters-exclusive series on PC gaming’s finest inanimates. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">skilled</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">reviewer</a> and newsman both, Nic was also exceptional at digging up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-i-only-drink-wine-that-was-aged-listening-to-the-nier-automata-soundtrack-now">offbeat</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-enjoy-daemonologies-incredibly-normal-sheep-with-me">darkly fascinating</a>, usually while deploying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-have-spent-the-morning-learning-about-a-recently-deceased-horse-thanks-to-umamusume-pretty-derby">turns of phrase</a> that could snap your neck with the G’s.</p>
<p>Nic also knew when to sharpen that wit and point it fearlessly at deserving targets, be it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-future-where-you-and-this-bucket-that-fits-over-your-head-decide-what-a-game-meant-to-say-not-the-useless-idiots-that-made-it">embarrassing pro-AI op-eds</a> or, uh, the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-get-my-old-battered-gamer-chair-for-oh-i-dunno-50-quid-1"> deals posts</a> that our bosses sometimes make me do. Still, some of my personal favourite Nic pieces had him doing the opposite, championing cool indie games he’d discovered or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dreams-on-a-pillows-developer-on-the-challenges-of-making-games-from-the-west-bank">telling the stories of marginalised devs</a>. And, of course, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/booked-for-the-week">Booked For The Week</a>, a regular dive into the reading habits of some of the industry’s most accomplished names – a brilliant and deeply RPS-y idea that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-deus-ex-looking-glass-studios-and-othersides-warren-spector">Warren Spector</a> maybe enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-warren-spector-keeps-emailing-me-about-books">a little too much</a>.</p><p>Nic really could do it all, and I’m chuffed to bits that he did it vaguely near the rest of us, from where we could leech at least some of his powers. Goodbye and good luck, Nic – whatever you do next, I’ll be reading.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Nic's work has never failed to bring me joy, even during those horribly busy times when all I could afford to do was glance at the headlines. Just scrolling through his author page, I couldn't help but laugh - more than once - at his fearsome and fearless wit. And then I felt sad once more that he's hauling his enormous sack of talent away from the RPS treehouse.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at this intro to one of his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">Battle Prose</a> diary posts. I picked it at random.</p>
<blockquote>"What do you mean the game didn't save?!", Thilmann had not so much asked Slackbladder as stowed the question in a sack of rocks, spat on the sack until no moisture remained in his body, then swung the sack at Slackbladder's forehead, leaving the thief dazed and more than a little soggy. "What in Odin's gammy eye flap does that even mean?!".<p>No idea, both Slackbladder and the rest of the company were forced to admit. All we knew was that last fight had gone even worse than we'd thought. Dogpollock and Glass Toe Jim Joe Jackon were still dead, but now Terry and Fritz had joined them. "How do you play a battle worse the second time?!" bellowed Thilmann. Again, none of us including Thilmann understood what this meant, although we all agreed it sounded unbelievably stupid. Real "massive idiot who still hasn't learned the game after four diary entries" hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nic is the most phenomenally entertaining writer. It always seemed to be effortless for him. That's almost certainly not true, of course. He probably bled from the eyes sometimes, thinking up the perfect nugget of sarcasm to turn a simple news post into a Nic Reuben News Post. Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say: thank you, Nic, for your offer of eye-blood. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’m sad I didn’t get to work with Nic for all that long. He’s an excellent writer and took on the task of being proudly and gloriously RPSy with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for people who’ve just remembered the capital of Liechtenstein on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He also typed ‘oh no’ in quite a reassuring way when, early in my RPS tenure, I managed to forget to save one of my articles before handing it over for edits, leading it to disappear into the purple ether. Best of luck for the future, Nic. Hope you enjoy the many more words you’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Nic is a magnificent writer, the sort that any gaming site would kill to have. The fact that we possessed a sliver of his soul for a short while meant we were all the better; the sad reality that he is leaving us means that our collective voice has been dampened. His bio here at RPS read that he was secretly “several Skaven in a trenchcoat “ - and if that is truly his real identity, I tip my hat to ‘em, whiskers and all. Said Skaven came down harder than I did on a few games during the last two years (looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollowbody-is-almost-a-great-survival-horror-game">Hollowbody</a>), but their critiques were always eminently well reasoned and argued. Damn, were they a fine collective of Ratkin. We’ll miss you, Nic.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Nic, I can’t think of an adequate compliment, and I suspect you have long since cringed yourself into a ball of wrinkled leather over all the embarrassing gushing above, so I’ll try not to overdo my bit. In brief, I have never worked harder or dreamed bigger as a writer than when working day-to-day with you. Ah nuts, fucked it already.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some pieces of yours that I especially treasure: your reviews of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">Grunn</a> (“less lock-and-key, more tearing layers of wrapping paper from a massive non-euclidean pass-the-parcel”), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/felvidek-review">Felvidek</a> ("the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime"), and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a> ("enter teenage android side character Chadley, a grotesque Satnav of a pimple of a productivity app, a creature spawned from fear of Not Enough Game, to squeeze the universe into a ball and wrap checklists around it"). I will also include a few of your best from the news section: your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-is-refreshingly-unlike-xcom-despite-wearing-the-same-tactical-underwear">Tactical Breach Wizards write-up</a>/stealth pitch for "the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams (call me)". Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">40-wordish, barely polysyllabic piece on a minor Total Warhammer update</a> that became one of our top articles that day, despite gobbing in the face of SEO. And your graceful intervention about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">Clair Obscur’s team size</a> that pivoted the entire critical conversation around it.</p><p>These are just a handful of my favourites. You are really very good at this writing trade, Nic! It is most vexing. Please carry on doing it in whatever capacity seems right. But in the shorter term, please treat yourself to an awesome break. </p>
