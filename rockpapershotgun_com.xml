I love fishing in games. I already went over this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-fishing-is-a-horror-fishing-sim-with-only-one-goal-reel-in-the-one-thing-that-was-never-meant-to-be-found">last week with Out Fishing</a>, so I won't repeat myself much more. But I do desperately need to tell you about FISH³, or FISH³: FISHTASTIC FISHING FISHSCAPES, a very unconventional fishing game that's also an arcade time trial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a>, where the fish you catch are also your boat's engine, and you can fish while you're racing? If, like me, that entire description has you thinking "come again", then read on.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how it works. Levels start off with you catching a fish, which involves moving your analogue sticks (controller only it seems, sorry mouse and keyboard diehards) into particular spots and hitting L2 and R2 to build up some meter to catch it. The racing part itself is akin to something like Wave Race 64, with ramps and nets to give you boosts and get in your way along the course.

<p>
What really makes the whole experience strange is that while you try to navigate a course, you can also catch more fish, because you actually have two fishing rods. This then presents a single analogue stick version of the same minigame, though this one requires more specific timing as you have to hit R2 at the same time as an arrow that's spinning around in a circle.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be clear: FISH³, in its current state, is jank as hell. I had a go at the demo and it is a sensory overload to start off with. And yet, I'm also incredibly fascinated by it. Like many arcade racers, you have target times and scores to beat, the former potentially hindered by you taking too long to reel in more fish (and other things), the latter bolstered by catching lots of fish (and other things).
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely the foundation of a special, but very odd, arcade game in there, one that I can see the biggest of sickos figuring out strats most of us will only be able to enjoy through clips on TikTok. I'm quite looking forward to seeing how it shapes up, and if you are too, then you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3641250/FISH_FISHTASTIC_FISHING_FISHSCAPES/">here</a>.

Another month, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update, again one that comes with a list of quality of life changes, but also one that comes with another surprising collaboration. Let's start with that one, which is, weirdly, a new story pack made in collaboration with Critical Role, the wildly popular actual play series. For some context, Critical Role did an official Assassin's Creed themed oneshot a little while back. In said oneshot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>'s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpp3RqWBB/">Robbie Daymond played a character called Rufino</a>, who's being added into the game through this new mission in update 1.0.6.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> explains. "While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers." Completing this quest nets you Rufino as a new ally, and you'll get the Critical Role logo as a banner.
</p>
<p>
Right, now the regular update stuff. A new nightmare difficult setting is now available with this update, which does a few different things. Defensive options are less effective in this mode, and you need to pull off perfect parries for them to deflect the hit fully. Enemy AI is "smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection." And combat resources are harder to find too.
</p>
<p>
For those of you oddly desperate to wear your headgear during cutscenes, that'll be an option now too, and there's toggles for specific types of VFX that you can turn off and on as well. The regional alert system available in castles has been expanded to the whole province on top of that, meaning that when you repeatedly attack "Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world." There's also three different camera presets when on a horse, for your riding pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for us here in PC land, there's an Ultra Low visual quality level - you can read about the exact specs that's catered to over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5qj66bYuntViG1YiqYlNJn/ac-shadows-title-update-106-release-notes">post about the update</a>, alongside the list of fixes and tweaks that you mostly don't need to worry about.
