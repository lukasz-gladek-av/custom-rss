            <p>
Because that sacred line called profit must always go up, we are seeing more and more game studios announce their intention to incorporate various forms of AI tech. PUBG publisher Krafton just recently referred to themselves as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">AI-first company</a>, the big wigs up top at EA are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">reportedly pushing for it hard</a>, it is, seemingly, unfortunately, inevitable. Which makes Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick's comments on it ever so slightly surprising - but only slightly, we'll get back to that.
</p>
<p>
Zelnick made an appearance at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's</a> Technology Executive Council Summit on Tuesday, where he was asked about his thoughts on the "promise" of AI in game development. Right off the bat, the CEO reminds us that he is still the CEO of publicly-traded company, as he did make it clear he's not a "naysayer" of AI. But he does actually seem to understand how limited it currently is, and crucially, for him and Take-Two, how risky it is for their intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
"We have to be really careful not to step on other people's intellectual property, and we don't ours stepped on," Zelnick explained. "As you know, if you create intellectual property with AI, you can't protect it. We're in the intellectual property business, we care about our rights, we care about other people's rights, and we have to protect what we make."
</p>
<p>
That's where the comments aren't very surprising, as it just seems like Zelnick is the very rare CEO that doesn't want to force AI right this very second because it risks their precious IP, IP that includes giants like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a> and NBA, as well as still very popular series like Borderlands.
</p><p>
This is where the surprising element comes in! Zelnick went on to note how in the event that AI has no constraints, he thinks whatever you'd make wouldn't be very good. "Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the ‘<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>’, and the marketing plan, and here it is? The answer is no. A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."
</p>
<p>
Zelnick goes on to say how AI is just big datasets, and defines them as "backward-looking," as in it's always working off of something else that's already been made rather than looking forward. Perhaps his most surprising line is this one: "there is no creativity that can exist, by definition, in any AI model, because it is data driven."
</p>
<p>
I'd like to be very clear that I really do think Zelnick is currently only hesitant about implementing the use of AI at scale because of his aforementioned concerns over IP. I'm just hoping (yes, a useless thing to do here) that maybe some other CEOs and shareholders might see the GTA guys holding off and think maybe we should too. Can't wait for that to not happen!

            <p>If you're having trouble getting into Minecraft, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or Sea Of Thieves right now, it might have something to do with a Microsoft outage that has taken services such as Azure offline. All three of the aforesaid games are <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/helldivers-2/">experiencing</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/sea-of-thieves/">spikes</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/">on</a> DownDetector.com, and there are reports of disconnections and failed logins on social media. The outage has also affected various possibly more consequential non-gaming things, such as airline bookings and banks. On the upside, it seems to have taken down Microsoft Outlook.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft appear to have identified what's broken. "We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue," notes an update, shared by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/live/microsoft-down-major-outage-hits-azure-365-and-more-even-minecraft-affected">Techradar</a>, who have set up a very excited liveblog full of words I don't understand. "We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and disabling a problematic route that we found to be related to this, and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.
</p>
<p>"We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to mitigate the portal access issues," the note from MS continues, filling my head with fractal visions of doors peeling away from doors. "Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly. We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update."</p>
<p>That message was from about 45 minutes before this post was published. If you can't access your Minecraft server now, I believe it's company policy that you are allowed to sneeze on Satya Nadella's lunch. It seems likely other online videogames are struggling besides those mentioned above. Let us know if you're having difficulty entering your preferred corner of cyberspace. Let us fill the comments thread with woe.</p>
