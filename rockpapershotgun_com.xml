It’s rare that a video game pumps actual joy into my shrunken, leathery heart, but I definitely felt a certain springtime stirring when I first jumped in 3D platformer Demon Tides. Hit the button again exactly when you land and you’ll be rewarded with a higher, twirlier jump. Hit it a third time and you’ll be treated to a triumphant, arcing somersault. Yes, this is the stuff! This is the old N64 Mario magic I’ve been missing. 
</p>
<p>
Nostalgia is the enemy of critical thinking, you say? The games industry is a flat circle of corporate iteration, is it? A stifling quAAAgmire from which not even moderate oddballs like New York-based developers Fabraz can escape? I know, I know, but please, let me have this. Let me do the “let people enjoy things” meme, just this once. Look, I can turn into a bat as well. I can turn into a fat little frisbee with ground-pound functionality. I can turn into a spindash-capable snek.

In Demon Tides you are a surly devil queen called Beebz who has sailed to a mysterious archipelago to meet a fellow monarch. Things immediately go pear-shaped in the demo when your ship encounters a pop-up coral reef and is swallowed by purple gunk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Beebz doesn’t really need a ship to get around. She starts the tale with a platforming skillset worthy of an endgame build, extending from more obvious capital-A abilities like the bat transformations to little, speedrunner-pleasing flourishes you tease out by feel. And this is but the beginning, for there are “over 50 unique talismans that uniquely modify or add to your move-set”, including a paraglider tool, the ability to stand on bubbles, and a mod that turns your UFO move into a hookshot. 
</p>
<p>
The world, meanwhile, is an infectious jumble of tropical islands and dockyard flotsam and big goofy collectibles. There’s a graffiti system with online affordances that is portrayed as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> version of soapstones in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. You can also race the ghosts of other players across the islands, and snap photos. Ah, smell that (Super Mario) sunshine. I think I prefer the crunchy 2D sprite/3D world aesthetic of the developers’ previous <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325900/Demon_Turf_Queens_Edition/">Demon Turf</a>, but it’s a charmer nonetheless.

The full version of Demon Tides launches this year - read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Steam</a>. If you like this, you might also enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pennys-big-breakaway-and-its-unruly-yo-yo-platforming-feels-like-a-hyper-sonic-the-hedgehog">Penny’s Big Breakaway</a>, the latest game from the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a> dev Christian Whitehead. If you're wondering why this isn't a pinball sim, you're probably thinking of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-tilt">Demon's Tilt</a>. If you came here because you mistyped while googling "demon tits", then for goodness' sake, try to clean up your act. It's barely lunchtime.

            <p>When you shoot your beginner pistol in action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-clock">Hell Clock</a>, it feels like someone slapped the foundations of the catacombs you're standing in with a pork chop big enough to decapitate god. There is beefy gun feel, and there is this: a gun chutney so chunksome and tactile I had to check my mouse hadn't suddenly sprouted haptics. As a single player, single class genre entrant, it's not quite fair to compare it to more sprawling mainstays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>. But I woke up feeling unfair today: even in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/">its demo form</a>, I'd much rather play Hell Clock than either of them.</p>

<p>In 1897, the near entirety of the Brazilian municipality of Canudos's 25,000 inhabitants were massacred by heavy artillery bombardments, after successfully repelling three previous assaults from government forces. That's a very truncated account, and you can <a href="https://www.aaihs.org/state-violence-and-the-canudos-massacre-in-brazil/">learn more here</a>, but that's the setting that Brazilian studio Rogue Snail (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/relic-hunters-zero">Relic Hunters</a> series) are folklore-ifying and undead-itising here. You play as gunslinger Pajeú, slinging his way gun-fully through dungeons to rescue the soul of his mentor The Counselor.</p>
<p>There's plenty here that'll be immediately familiar to dedicated ARPeGgios, but there's also a good dose of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> and other action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> (lites). You blast mobs with hotkey commands, building mana with one kind of bullet, then spending it on other, better bullets. You gulp down potions. You dodge with space (it hurts enemies though!). You collect shiny loot and…</p>
<p>Wait, but you actually <em>don't</em> collect shiny loot. And even if you did, you'd lose it after your run anyway. Instead, you collect purple crystals to spend on permanent gear and abilities between runs. Everything else - gold, ability buffs,   - is temporary. There's another wrinkle, too. Each run has a time limit of 20 minutes, although there is a 'relaxed mode' option to disable this, and it does pause during boss fights.</p>
<p>Here are some lovely bullet point features from Steam. Actually, I added the bullet points. Wouldn't want to misquote Steam. SEGA once misquoted a review I wrote of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 in which I said I'd be "hesitant to call Warhammer III a landmark strategy game in its own right". "A landmark strategy game in its own right" - The Guardian. Utterly shameless. Here's the fact-me-doos:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>RACE AGAINST TIME</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every second counts as you battle the undead forces of your oppressors. Risk delving deeper for powerful loot and face the nightmarish incarnations of those who sought to bury the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FORGE UNSTOPPABLE BUILDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hunt down ancient Relics infused with the strength of resistance. Create devastating combinations that channel Canudos's unbreakable spirit into unstoppable power.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNLEASH HELLISH POWER</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Master a diverse selection of devastating abilities born from righteous fury. Dance through hordes with lightning-fast knife strikes, smash enemies with Canudos' great bell, or rain rapid-fire death from your trusty sidearm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REWRITE HISTORY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each descent brings new chances to right historical wrongs. Discover unique combinations of Blessings to evolve your build as you face the demons of Brazil's dark past, present, and future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIGHT AT YOUR OWN PACE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you seek a brutal test against history's oppressors or a thoughtful journey of justice, Hell Clock adapts to your path. Remove all time pressure with Relaxed Mode, or push your limits in Hardcore mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VENGEANCE NEVER ENDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Experience a complete three-act story campaign, then test your perfectly tuned builds in the challenging Endgame, where your gear, abilities, and playstyle are pushed to their limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're a sicko for the long term grind, build theorycrafting, and the like, then sure - it's far too early to say whether Hell Clock can compete with its behemoth genre mates. But in terms of just, like, having fun with a videogame - yeah, this is the only ARPG I'm interested in playing right now. It's due out "Q2" of this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
