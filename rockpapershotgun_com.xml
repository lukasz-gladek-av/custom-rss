            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> modding group have just polished off a game jam in which they challenged themselves to recreate every singleplayer map in id Software's 1996 FPS from memory alone. That is, they were forbidden from replaying the original game before they started. As Slipseer user iLike80sRock puts it, "if somehow id1 was wiped off of all computers in the world, do we collectively remember the maps well enough to recreate them?"</p><!--more-->
<p>The Quake from Memory pack has been in the works since last year. Find the finished package <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-from-memory-full-release.487/">here</a>, with installation instructions. I don't know the original Quake well enough to comment on the accuracy of the results - I was naught but a sobbing child when Quake came out, and also, a hopeless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> enthusiast. Still, I'm very interested in the concept of this jam, because when we recreate things from memory, it <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/visual-memory-distortions.html">tends to reveal some kind of bias</a>. </p>
<p>The comments on that Slipseer thread run a fun gamut. Levels are "either uncannily spot on or butchered". Some rooms are too tall, perhaps because people remember being physically smaller when they played the game, and that difference in scale has somehow bled across the gap between simulation and the flesh. Some nail traps seem to fire too fast. Some maps "are very different in ways I can't explain in words".</p>
<p>There's a sense of fascination, throughout: it's not just people complaining that the Shamblers are the wrong way round. The premise of recreating the game from memory cultivates an intrigue and a generosity not typically found in responses to certain high-fidelity videogame remasters or remakes. </p><p>In the absence of lasting, external tangible records, such as writing, remembering becomes <a href="https://historyireland.com/recycling-the-dustbin-of-irish-history-the-radical-challenge-of-folk-memory/">more of a communal practice</a>. I'm interested to know if the Quake from Memory modders were allowed to show each other their work and compare reflections, or if each mapmaker had to go it alone. "Collectively" implies the former.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I've been trying to work out if I could recreate any of my favourite games from memory. Back in the day, I could have drawn most of Sonic 2's layouts by hand, but I have played a million games since, and that squiggly hedgehog lore is lost to me. I have sharper memories of G-Police, the cyberpunk flight sim from WipEout creators Psygnosis.</p>
<p>In particular, I have quite vivid memories of one mission in which you have to stave off base assaults while tracking down and obliterating an approaching land train. The time management rigours of that mission have drummed those dome cities into my head. Still, don't come crying to me if somebody manages to delete all surviving copies of G-Police. Missions 11-16 are just hypermissile whooshing noises on repeat.</p>
<p>Which game could <em>you</em> recreate from memory alone? Thanks to RPS reader Salty for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-346?view=comments">posting about this in the latest RPS wappity</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> developers Enhance have released a new demo for their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a> on Steam, alongside news that the spacey rhythm attack game will launch on November 11th. If you missed Tetris Effect, it's a game about making deletable lines out of falling blocks while standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise, meanwhile, sees you arranging blocks into 2X2 scoreable combinations, which are removed from the playing field by a horizontally sweeping Time Line. While standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p><!--more-->

<p>There have been eight previous Lumines releases, including remasters, on various platforms since the first game's appearance in 2004. This one is a collaboration with Monstars Inc, who also worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez Infinite</a>. I played a bit of Lumines Arise earlier this year, and spoke to an Enhance developer about its new emphasis on expressing "the human", which is what sets it apart thematically from Tetris Effect. I'll get that write-up turned around before the release date. If I don't, feel free to quote this piece at me aggressively in the comments on any and all subsequent news articles.</p><p>In the short term, I'll say that Arise is yet another pacey and flamboyant puzzler that drizzles your occipital lobe in (for example) footage of frenzied chameleons, while challenging your primary motor cortex to save you from total visual constipation. Yes, it's making bits of your brain fight each other. I like when games do that.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm interested to make sense of Arise being a more "human" game than Effect. Much as I enjoyed Tetris Effect, I entertain suspicions that Enhance's framing of Arise might be bullshit artistry. Perhaps "more human" just means there are more human figures in the background art. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the devs mentioned Enhance's most recent game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humanity">Humanity</a>, during my hands-on - RPS reviewer Kim Armstrong <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humanity-review">witheringly summarised</a> that as "perfect puzzles pumped with existential hot air".</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847360/Lumines_Arise_Demo/">Here's the Steam link for the demo</a>, which will be available from today, August 26th till September 3rd. It includes three stages from the single-player Journey mode and a bit of new multiplayer mode Burst Battle, which can be played online cross-platform. The full game has VR compatibility but there's none of that nonsense in the demo, and they've locked the difficulty to easy. They don't want to scare you away, after all.</p>
<p>Those damn fool editors of RPS gone by never found time to review Tetris Effect, but they did put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">best VR games</a>.</p>
