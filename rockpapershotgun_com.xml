<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have announced their next gig as a fledgling games publisher. They're palling up with MythicOwl to release the latter's jaunty delivery sim Truckful, in which absolutely nothing waits for you in the woods. In which there are no ghost trucks. In which "hidden paths, misty wetlands, unforgiving marshes and dusty quicksands [do not] tell the stories of the past, waiting to be discovered". Here's a trailer.

<p>
At first blush, Truckful is a jolly 3D roadster with boisterous cargo physics, viewed from a slanted side-on perspective. It's about stacking your flatbed high with loose objects such as pianos and vases, then trying to transport them safely across the rough roads of this idyllic countryside setting.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me a bit of the village where I grew up, except that there don't seem to be as many obnoxious middle-aged townies on racing bicycles, though you do encounter a lot of chatty pedestrians, some of whom need a lift. The local forest also reminds me of the scrawny oak copses down the road from my childhood home, except that I don't recall the roots being big enough to drive up, and I don't remember the sun ever vanishing like a swallowed candle. Definitely some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">mets√§npeitto</a> going on hereabouts. Ooh, who's that peering between the boughs? Yeah, best not stop for directions. Focus on delivering the piano.
</p>
<p>
Having Pocketpair on board as publisher means that MythicOwl have more money to blow on bonus moving parts. "With Pocketpair's support, you can expect that many great gameplay features we were cooking during past couple months, will make it the game as its development is now fully funded &amp; secure," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">a Steam post</a>. "We're testing truckloads (!) of new stuff - locations, quests, characters, upgrades &amp; unlockables - so make sure to stay tuned to our social and community channels for more content!" I will forgive you that whoopee-cushion parenthesis if you'll forgive me for saying that you should have called this Cormac McCosy's The Road.
</p>
<p>
I guess the nearest parallel for this both mood-wise and in terms of the cargo-stacking mechanics is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>. Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">other publishing joint</a> that I know about is an untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about the entertainment industry from Surgent Studios, creators of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.

            <p>'18 Wheels Of Thunder' boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racin</a>g's original <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/">box art</a>, in a font forged from guitar pedals, light beer, and divorce papers. Flames jet from the snout of the marauding 'rig like snorted breakfast tequila following an especially piquant ex-wifely punchline. A rammed police car flails uselessly against the sheer girth of but one of those 18 thunderous wheels. Perhaps we might imagine a single tear trickling down the exasperated coparoo's cheek. As we reach out to wipe it from the case, we unwittingly dissolve the '1' from the tagline, leaving us with only '8'.</p>
<p>The 8 remains, smugly, for two decades. 8 is the Metacritic score for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. That is so incredibly powerful that words fail me. Not for Metacritic, meaningless institution run by and for leprous prestige weasels that it is. It's powerful for Big Rigs. To get less than a 61 on Metacritic, a game must either be so brazenly committed to its own bizarre artistic vision that it fizzles the minds of lesser critics like Skittles in lemonade, or simply be unplayable wank. I have read a lot of evidence that points toward the latter, but that can't be true, or it wouldn't <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/">be on Steam</a>, right? Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/steam">PCGN</a>.</p>

<p>"Get ready for some brake jamm'in, CB talk'in, convoy roll'in action across America," screams the trailer, with all the hammy revisionism of Tommy Wiseau labelling The Room "a dark comedy" after the fact.  It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, in case that wasn't clear, although Steam also has it tagged as 'psychological horror'. I'd call Steam users out for only having, like, two jokes but they're basically working with fridge magnet poetry so it's a noble effort. You'll drive one of four 'rigs over five tracks, hauling loads and trying to stay one step ahead of johnny lawman. Oh, you thought this was <em>regular</em> driving action? Hillarious. This is "non-stop driving action", you pitiful cornflake. </p>
<p>Is this new release in better shape than the original? Or, to put it another way, does it actually function? Reviews have it at a light-to-medium 'still mostly busted'. There are also a few complaints about an allegedly dodgy installer wizard. Interestingly, the current custodians do at least seem interested in keeping it playable. It's already received a few patches addressing fatal errors, the most recent of which arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Following the game's disastrous release in 2003, producer 	Sergey Titov <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-2/">apparently offered</a> to personally replace any copies sent to him with a game of the buyer's choice from the Activision Value Catalog. Only 20 people took him up on it. I'd imagine the likely culprit here is malaise, although perhaps these thunderous wheels really do have an undeniable magnetism; a primeval, electric pull that writhes infinitely, like a big fat Metacritic eight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>

<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.
