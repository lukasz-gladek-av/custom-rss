            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMOs</a> are a strange facilitation of games because they are, ostensibly, dead on arrival. Not dead in the sense of "lol dead game," that exact comment you see littered in the comments of articles, videos etc. about literally any online game, no matter how popular it is. Dead in the sense that it will die, as all things do, because one day the servers will go down and there will be no (legal) way to play it anymore. I put the legal in brackets there because there are many a fan effort that allow you to play a range of "officially" dead MMOs, but what would a game about a Frankensteinian revival of such a thing look like? Probably, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gorgons-garden">Gorgon's Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Gorgon's Garden, we go back to the year 2008, weirdly, personally, probably the last year I spent regular amounts of my time playing an MMO. It's a random summer day, and you are trawling through Hypogeum.net, a resuscitated version of it anyway, a fictitious forum all about an MMO called Gorgon's Garden, now defunct due to a majority of the game being sealed away by a digital currency that no longer exists.

<p>
In practicality, the game is not the game, "Gorgon's Garden," but the game, Gorgon's Garden. It is you, hanging out on your computer, in what looks to be the family computer room - you can see the edges of the computer screen, hints at a room beyond the bevels fully revealed in a reflection when the screen goes dark. You can browse that fake forum, read cringey posts from people of all ages, learning tidbits about their lives, and importantly, find a tool from a notorious hacker that bypasses that dead digital currency. The world of Gorgon's Garden opens up to you once more.
</p><p>
It's mostly quite simple, you can only look left or right, though you can move in any direction. Attacks are limited to the swing of a sword and one spell, and as you kill enemies you level up, which doesn't do much but increase your health.
</p>
<p>
As you delve further and further into the game, or perhaps dive is the right word, it starts to fall apart, the forum acting as a hub of secrets pushing you further down the rabbit hole. What starts as something silly moves towards something genuinely a bit unsettling, and I'll stop there because the whole thing is short, and free, and given the season, you've not got much reason to not try it out yourself.
</p>
<p>
If you need further convincing, Gordon's Garden comes in part from Feverdream Johnny, developer of one of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orbos-odyssey-is-psychonauts-meets-sonic-adventure-and-you-can-shoot-your-character-like-a-bullet">weirdo platformers Orbo's Odyssey</a>. Go on, give it a go, remind yourself of the horrors of niche forums and your favourite dead MMO, there's no better time for it. You can pick it up on <a href="https://feverdreamjohnny.itch.io/gorgons-garden">Itch.io</a>.

A thing I find a lot of joy in is the fact that despite there's technically a new, shinier, perhaps by some people's standards better version of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> is still kicking around. Before the Old School was tagged on the front end of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> was an MMO I put many hours into (and found little success in) as a youth with too much free time, so the fact practically two decades later it's introducing a brand new skill into the game simultaneously impresses me and strikes existential fear into my heart because of how old this game actually is.
</p>
<p>
Moving on swiftly, sailing! That's the new skill coming to Old School RuneScape, the first new one since its launch. According to a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1">blog post</a>, sailing is quite the undertaking, described as "bigger and more expansive than any content that's come before it," and a skill that "touches almost every aspect of the game." With this new skill, you can own up to five boats at any time. These boats are upgradable, and there's three sizes to choose from: the raft, small boat, and large boat.

There's ship combat, which apparently mostly works the same as land combat, and you can also take a few different NPCs with you out on the sea - or your real friends too! Levelling up requires, technically, just one thing, which is, well, sailing. This includes "interacting with facilities on your boat" like trimming your sails, an action that nets you some XP as well as a speed boost.
</p><p>
On top of all that, you can salvage shipwrecks, chart the oceans you travel across, do some deep sea trawling, complete new quests, gather new resources, and while this one's a bit more secretive, there's new areas to explore too, including 30 new islands, some of which have some new dungeons.
</p>
<p>
The sailing update is coming to Old School RuneScape pretty soon too, as it's currently planned to launch in just under a month's time on November 19th.
