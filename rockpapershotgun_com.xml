            <p>Good news if you've been a bit frustrated with how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> handles PvE and PvP, specifically in terms of its treacherous Deep Desert. The game's creative director Joel Bylos has announced some changes coming in response to player feedback on both those and the Landsraad.</p>
<p>Basically, it looks like Funcom have switched up their plans to take the concerns folks have cited into account, aiming for a nice compromise between the original ideas and the practicalities of what's been happening since the game dropped in full.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">lengthy letter</a> to DA players, Bylos wrote that while the devs still believe their core concept of the Deep Desert as a dangerous, constantly changing place you go to get the rarest stuff, they're not aiming to force PvE enjoyers to engage with PvP just to get the good stuff.</p>
<p>So, to ensure those folks don't get locked out of the endgame, the director revealed that "starting soon, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as 'Partial Warfare (PvE)' areas where players will be able to explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without the threat of conflict they may not want". The likes of "Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields" will stay as PvP areas, to preserve the biggest rewards coming with the biggest risk.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We’ve been listening.</p><p>The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.</p><p>Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about… <a href="https://t.co/ZbHKgEBDwk">pic.twitter.com/ZbHKgEBDwk</a></p></div>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1937161730649452781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Speaking of PvP, Bylos wrote that the devs are "planning to make more changes to the Deep Desert to accommodate ground battles and reinforce the use of player builds", outlining some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">already incoming scout ornithopter tweaks</a> designed to help ensure air superiority isn't the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">be all and end all</a>. There'll also be "additional changes to mechanics like respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, hand scanners, and other mechanics that we see being abused in the Deep Desert".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Funcom are aiming to address some "key flaws" in the Landsraad that folks have cited. These include problems with tasks being turned in very quickly, and folks being able to do nothing with them once they're completed. "Stockpiling is currently rewarded, but that is not our intention for this system, and we will make some changes to address it as best we can," the director wrote, adding that the system will also be "updated to provide micro rewards for solo/small group players".</p>
<p>It's nice to see the devs finding a way to balance their vision for DA with making the changes folks want. Judging by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1liirqh/a_message_from_the_creative_director_on_pve_and/">the socials</a>, the worm lovers who've been doin' the Dune are glad to see these steps are being taken, even if there's no concrete timeline on a lot of them at this point.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sorry, we're not done yet, CD Projekt has said about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update that also represents that same phrase, it being about the third patch to be labelled the final one the game'll be getting. Update 2.3 was originally set to be dropping on this week, but now it's been delayed so the devs can make it about the same size as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're probably adding more stuff to the pile of new things we never thought Cyberpunk'd still be getting at this stage. We're multiple encores deep in the Samurai gig at this point, but hey, the crowd's still having a great time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We initially hoped to put Update 2.3 in your hands on June 26th," the studio wrote in a post addressed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SX5CJ2hN_c">choom nation</a>, "However, we'll need some more time to make sure we're happy with it — we're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2. We'll update you further as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>So, no new details about what to expect in this next patch, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-it-turns-out-cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-one-more-update-after-all-and-its-not-too-far-away">was announced</a> alongside Cyberpunk making its debut on a certain new console made by a company often associated with the profession you enlist if your loo's clogged. Well, aside from the fact it's apparently going to about as beefy as its predecessor, the previous holder of the 'last Cyberpunk patch, for realsies' title.</p> <div>

<p>In case you were busy in December 2024, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-it-turns-out-cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-one-more-update-after-all-and-its-not-too-far-away">update 2.2</a> added a bunch of extra customisation options for your car and character, as well as the ability for Keanny Reevhand to sometimes spawn into your passenger seat during free roam. You know, so you can show him your sickest handbrake turns without attempting a drift while something important's happening.</p>
<p>Who knows what CD Projekt has in store for this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-surprisingly-substantial-update-21-is-out-now">final</a>, final, final patch. They've added in a whole metro system previously, so maybe we're getting futuristic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bus-simulator">Bus Simulator</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Cybertruck Simulator</a> that's about flying MAN and DAF lorries with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-flying-car-modder-has-removed-the-games-max-speed-limit-and-i-may-soon-be-involved-in-a-1222mph-mid-air-fender-bender">heavy duty thrusters</a> and mantis windscreen wiper blades.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things]]></content:encoded>
