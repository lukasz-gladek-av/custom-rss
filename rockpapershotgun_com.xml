The funny thing about games is that while making them, if you put something in them, it's quite hard to take that thing back out again. Who knows what that might break! Which can of course lead to people finding things that were never meant to be seen, like cut parts of a game, which is pretty much exactly what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> through the discovery of a level all about Ashley.
</p>
<p>
As shown off by YouTuber and modder Thekempy, this Ashley level seemingly would have been called Chapter 0, acting as a prelude to the main game. In it, you'd essentially be playing the lead-up to the moment Ashley gets captured, with some of the areas potentially intended for her to explore still viewable in-game, just with not much detail or accessible.

<p>
Interestingly enough, you might notice some bits that feel a bit familiar. That's because scenes from this cut chapter actually appeared in the remake's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTMwx9-rKe8">second trailer</a>, back in 2022. These scenes never ended up in the final game, leaving them a bit of a mystery, though again, all sorts get cut from games all the time, it's not that odd. But at least we have something of an answer!
</p><p>
Most of what's available to play doesn't function as certain discovered details appear to imply, like cutscenes that are meant to trigger at certain points. There are some animation triggers that lead to Ashley running around a bit too haphazardly for my liking, but for the most part, there's not all that much going on, so you're not missing out on much.
</p>
<p>
In any case, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s roundhouse kicking Leon Kennedy will be back in our arms, I mean, back on our screens soon enough, as he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">set to be playable in the upcoming ninth entry in the series</a>, Resident Evil Requiem, due out next month, February 27th.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomwood">Gloomwood</a> opened the year not with a whimper, but with a town - a Hightown! Right on January 1st, a fresh update and new area (The Hightown District) arrived in the early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game. This new district is very vaguely described as the game's "most vertical open area" yet, and it certainly looks as suitably gloomy as the rest of the game.
</p>
<p>
One of the big new additions alongside the area is a new enemy type, the hoggish constable. The launch trailer offers little to go on on how they might behave, though I imagine the pig and police imagery might offer a hint as to the kind of brutality they might enact upon you if you're spotted.

There are a few new, as a mostly detail-less Steam post explains, toys to pick up in the update too. One of these toys is a revolver, albeit one with a scope attachment that looks like it may be useful for taking out enemies from afar. There's also a firebomb, which I'm going to assume does exactly what it says on the tin.
</p><p>
This update also serves a reminder for me personally that I really should pick up Gloomwood one of these days. As much as I want to ignore it, the passage of time has resulted in this game having already been in early access for more than three years now. Back when it launched, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomwoods-grimy-stealth-playground-deserves-better-than-the-agony-of-early-access">Alice B. had a little go with it</a> and found it to be quite good, but also simply unfinished, lamenting how hard it was to recommend when the world wasn't ready for anyone to put their skills to the test. Perhaps all these years on, it's time to dive in.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up or wishlist Gloomwood on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/">here</a>.
