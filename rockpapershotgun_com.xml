            <p>
I think my big problem with the proliferation of Soulslikes as a genre is twofold: one, that so many games get labelled as such despite not being such, and two, they're all much too similar. There might be mechanical differences, but there's no big thing that clearly sets them apart from what FromSoftware already does so well, not even an aesthetic overhaul. That's part of why I quite liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>, and why I'm curious if cautious about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>.
</p>
<p>
RPS' own James got to go <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-a-first-person-soulslike-work-playing-napoleonic-parryfest-valor-mortis-suggests-oui">hands-on with the game not too long ago</a>, and despite only getting to try out a tutorial and the game's first boss, he did feel that it's a game potentially worth keeping an eye on, first-person combat and all. The only problem is, I'm not James! And neither are you, but I'm sure you, like me, would possibly like to give Valor Mortis a try to get your own verdict on what a first-person Soulslike is, well, like. This is where I come in again to tell you that you can do that, actually, because there's a <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/">playtest you can sign up to right now</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's not particularly clear if everyone that does sign up will get to try it, but it's worth a shot if you're even remotely interested. Apparently the playtest, which runs from October 6th to October 13th, will feature the game's first chapter. That includes a mini-boss and a proper boss, and a taste of the upgrade tree and level progression. In any case, as James also notes, the devs behind it also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, a quite good first-person action game or so I've been led to believe, so perhaps there's not much to worry about. 
</p>
<p>
Valor Mortis doesn't have an exact release just yet, but it is supposed to be releasing in 2026. Let's see if that comes to fruition in this delay ridden era we live in.

            <p>
Anyone fancy taking a journey across space? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/daedalic-reveal-story-driven-star-trek-voyager-strategy-game-in-which-you-can-betray-everything-janeway-ever-stood-for">Last month</a>, Daedalic Entertainment announced it is publishing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" from developer gameXcite. It was only a quick reveal though, so I'm sure they were quite Xcited to reveal a first look at gameplay in a trailer earlier today.
</p>
<p>
As you can probably gather, this is an adaptation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>: Voyager specifically, but the whole big thing isn't just a strategy game laid over the top of the show's main plot beats, it's being able to enact "what if?" type scenarios. How this manifests in gameplay terms looks quite involved. For starters, there's the ship management. This looks quite a lot like Fallout: Shelter, where you have a whole bunch of different blocks that you can build different types of rooms in for your crew to go about their business in.

<p>
Then you've got your space combat, which is a bit harder to take stock of from the trailer. It looks like you'll have different abilities you can use to fend off baddies, with a cooldown stopping you from spamming them. I think you may also have to keep an eye on specific parts of your ship from getting too damaged, but I can't quite tell exactly truth be told, it's only a short bit of the trailer.
</p><p>
Aside from that, you can also use different members of your crew to solve specific missions, and you'll have to make sure you choose the right members to do so as they all have their own pros and cons. And then there's some very '90s FMV looking bits where you can choose alternate story paths from what looks to be classic episodes (I don't know, I'm not a Trekkie, feel free to shout at me if none of them look particularly classic).
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">here</a>.
