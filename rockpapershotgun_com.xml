            <p>
I'm writing up Astro Prospector for a couple of reasons: firstly, it reminds me of two childhood favourites, Atari's Asteroids and the less-known Crystal Quest for the Macintosh. And secondly, there's something appealingly perverse about a <em>bullet hell</em> of all gametypes that is always simulating the player nodding off at the keyboard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's an "incremental" single-screen shmup and office burnout spoof in which you control a spaceship with the mouse, auto-mining asteroids for giant coffee beans, while avoiding or destroying the forces of the villainous SpaceCorp.</p>
<p>The length of each round depends on your pilot's starting caffeine intake: after a few seconds, their eyelids will droop shut and obscure the view. But you can grind your beans between missions to unlock buffs that empower your ship and prolong your wakefulness. One of the unlocks lets you fly through hoops that generate Flow, the productivity guru's favourite tipple.
</p>
<p>
The first SpaceCorp enemies consist of lethargic fidget-spinners - easily flummoxed by orbiting slowly around them. Later enemies deliver the expected screenfuls of projectiles, obliging you to follow very particular paths across the screen while continuing to excavate the swirling spacerocks.</p>
<p>As frenetic as the battles get, though, it seems you'll always have to worry about your pilot falling asleep. To sleep: perchance to dream of upgrade screens. And then, back to the gauzy brown starfields for a top-up. Such madness. So sadness. Nice pixel HUD and ship designs, though. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Find the demo on Steam</a>.

            <p>Gun.</p>
<p>There are a lot of them in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, it being a shooter and all. HD2 players aren't happy for it to end there though.</p>
<p>They've been asked for their input in renaming the single city on Super Earth they've so far succeeded in rebuilding since all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Illuminate invasion business</a>, and they're voting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">Gun</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let's face it, given the precedents set by the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36064659">Boaty McBoatface</a> and its lesser known NASCAR twin the <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/05/01/why-kansas-nascar-cup-called-buschy-mcbusch-race-400/4897438001/">2021 Buschy McBusch Race 400</a> (yes, that was a name given to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Buschy_McBusch_Race_400">actual professional motor race</a>), this isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Having managed to rebuild the city of Remembrance through their recent Galactic War efforts, players are currently voting in an <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1391934973841375273">Arrowhead-run Discord poll</a> dedicated to deciding on a new name for it. A new name by which to remember Remembrance. Yep, the whole thing's the usual kind of Helldiversy meta-joke that's still managed to make me crack a grin.</p> <div>

<p>Cue the equally jokey response thus far. 35k and counting votes, that's over 70% of the total share, to rename the city 'Gun'. Well ahead of the second place runner 'Everlasting Memory', which currently boasts just over 9k votes, and third place 'New Remembrance' at 3k. Now, the option that's currently last, 'Peacebeacon's Bloodlight', I'd argue deserves to be there, but I think fourth place 'Winds of Change of Tides of War' warrants a bit more than just over 1k votes.</p>
<p>Sure, it's far too long, but you could abbreviate it to the snappy WoCoToW, which would only make you sound a bit like an alarmed space bird being attacked by a Terminid whenever you say it. Plus, long-winded and grandiose bollocks is the name of the game with HD2's Starship Troopers-ish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">satire of the fash</a>. Did everyone just forget naming their ships something like 'Ombudsman of Individual Merit'?</p>
<p>Anyway, they're clearly gonna name it 'Gun', which is still at least minor chuckleworthy and also feels very 2025. That is to say, I'm not too pistolff about it.</p>

            <p>Armchair History Interactive would like to you know that their upcoming strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-command">Master Of Command</a> is full of smart, unforgiving systems. I know that because they emailed RPS saying that our "strategy features often spotlight smart, unforgiving systems".</p>
<p>I imagine several other outlets also received this exact email but this didn't stop me thinking "you know what - they're right! I <em>am</em> strategy-clever and tactics-tough! And what better way to show that than by covering this game, completely of my own volition and with no outside influence from cleverly worded PR emails playing on my sense of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-knower's pride. That'll show those fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee. Who's "making too many explosiony noises during this serious reenactment of the Somme" now, eh?</p>
<p>Truthfully though, I probably would have covered this without the email. It looks suitably grand, and I really dig the idea of a strategy where the management isn't about empires, but the personal journey of your army on campaign. Plus, you get to play uniform dress-up. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game is set during the Seven Years' War, and you'll be managing your army's supplies, soldiers and equipment across the campaign. Lose all your lads, you lose the run. The line from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">Steam</a> description that really hooked me is this'n:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Master of Command is about the relationship between your army and the world around it. March too far and your men will starve. Rest too long and the enemy will reinforce. Your troops rely on you not just to lead them into battle, but to keep them fed, equipped, and alive long enough to reach the final objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't march on an empty stomach, though. That'd be madness. First, fill your belly with features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Tactical Battles:</strong> No turns, no pausing. Engage in historical combat where morale, stamina, terrain, and timing determine the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Regiments:</strong> Equip your troops with historical equipment and weapons that affect accuracy, stamina, morale, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Campaign:</strong> Choose a region and enter a fully real-time map with fog of war, branching encounters, and a mobile enemy presence.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Army Management:</strong> Every loss matters. Units gain experience, officers level up, and your choices carry across each region of the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>150 Historical Units:</strong> Recruit from an extensive roster of 18th-century European forces, each with unique stats, roles, and visuals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Of Command is out sometime this year. I'm going to paint all the hats pink, see how those damn fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee like that one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/master-of-command-is-a-strategy-game-of-crunchy-musketry-and-total-war-style-battles-that-tells-the-story-of-an-army-not-an-empire]]></content:encoded>
