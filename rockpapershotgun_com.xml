            <p>Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s just gotten a patch with some noteworthy balancing tweaks and fixes ahead of its latest warbond - <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos</a> - dropping. In short, a fair few guns now do more damage, some enemies have been made a tad less potent, and the drawback which usually comes with attachinga magnifying scope to your favourite bug blaster has been scaled back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274?l=english">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0 patch</a>, the studio have clearly spied that the weapon ergonomics penalty suffered if you equip a long-range sight to your gun was putting folks off from using such attachments. So, in order to make them "more a matter of preference", you'll now notice the muzzles of guns with tube red dot sights, combat scopes, and sniper scopes being a fair whack less lethargic in following where you point your crosshair. The sniper scope change also applies to the anti-materiel rifle.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Arrowhead have begun to implement some tweaks designed to make pistols more ideal at close range over long, while still effective enough to use. Moving to primary guns, the defender, reprimand, M7S SMG, variable, and M90A have all had their damage upped by three to 10 points, with a couple also getting durable damage boosts. The peacemaker, verdict, and M6C/SOCOM pistols have also undergone similar tweaks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, war strider and bile spewer enemies have been tweaked to stagger less when hit with explosions. The stalker, on the other hand, has had its tongue attack nerfed slightly so you won't stagger as much when slapped by the thing protruding from the bug's meaty maw. Finally, some new unbound keybind options have been added to make quick-swapping gear easier and playing in first-person should mesh better with your field-of-view settings.</p><p>There you go. I'm going to duck talking about the bug fixes to instead mention that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation in the works at Sony is now set to be directed by Justin Lin of Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fame, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. I mention this because it's got me wondering what the drifting equivalent of being sent flying by a rogue bug tongue is. I assume the answer's maybe catching a kerb, rolling, and landing with your passenger's mouth locked over your nose. That's never happened to me, I assure you.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell your family about this patch and the movie. They need to know Vin Diesel'll now have less scope trouble when he's inevitably confirmed to be playing <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1779875631334899883">General Brasch</a>.</p>

            <p>An online co-op mod for very French and very puppety soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been released in alpha form. As of writing, it'll let you take on boss battles with a friend and its creators are hoping to offer full multplayer playthroughs similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">seamless co-op mod</a> further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While the multiplayer mods of most FromSoft games are famously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">the work of modding savant Yui</a>, this Lies of P co-op add-on's been developed by a three person crew called Ember Wave. They've sunk "more than one year of reverse-engineering and systems development" into getting their project to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/368?tab=description">alpha release on Nexus Mods</a>, having shown off some progress via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbuROQ5LG5g">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmberWaveTeam">Patreon</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As of right now, the mod'll let you jump into boss fights across the base game and DLC - including the likes of the Scrapped Watchman, Nameless Puppet, and Arlecchino the Blood Artist - with one other player. So, duos for the moment, but the modders do note in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-mod-144752076">fresh Patreon FAQ</a> that they'll consider upping that limit as they overcome more technical hurdles.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see each other's health bars, spectate your partner via a special death cam if you fall, and be revived if they activate a stargazer. "You can mess around after killing a boss," the modders say, "but crashes might happen."</p><p>As for their next steps towards releasing the full co-op mode that'll allow seamless end-to-end playthroughs, the Ember Wave add that they "still need to sync world events (doors, elevators, quests, etc.) and fix a specific issue related to entering the Hotel, which causes unexpected behavior". So, that's on their plate going forwards, alongside nixing any major issues with the alpha release.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the alpha a go, you'll need to be running Windows 10 or 11 and have a Steam copy of Lies of P running <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1627720/announcements/detail/502836597467646578">September's version 1.12.0.0 update</a>. <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">Radmin VPN</a> is also required to "simulate a LAN connection" in order to host co-op sessions. Finally, if you want to battle DLC bosses, both players will need to own the DLC in question.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if this co-op mod for the boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn</a> dubbed "the closest we'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC, probably" can hit the complex heights of Yui's masterpieces when it reaches its final form. Until then, the modders'll no doubt keep on pulling marionette strings to see what they can accomplish.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell remake</a> has a new director who's served as its director before. David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft and take up the role he left when he departed the company in 2022, not long after being tapped as the remake's original director following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-have-stealth-announced-a-splinter-cell-remake">late 2021 announcement</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake," Grivel revealed in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU">LinkedIn post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/">GamesRadar</a>. "A very special team and project to me."</p>
<p>Grivel's return to the project follows a few years in which he's worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">now-shuttered studio Ridgeline Games</a>, briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto to work on the early stages of an unannounced project, then left to join NetEase-backed studio Worlds Untold. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">Worlds Untold then shut its doors</a> as he was transitioning into has job there, which sounds like a particularly horrible scenario to have faced.</p>
<p>With that road walked, the developer's now back at Ubi Toronto again, having spent 11 years there in the initial stint that ended with his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985690674448793600/">2022 departure</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> remake. During that time, he worked as a game designer on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, Primal, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>.</p><p>If you're wondering whether Grivel's return will see Ubisoft actually pull the covers off the Splinter Cell remake or provide an update as it how its development's going, the answer seems to be a no, at least for now. Things have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">very quiet on the game's front</a> since that initial 2021 reveal, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">potential teases</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-is-now-on-steam-but-youll-have-to-deal-with-some-ubisoft-faffage">Steam arrival of Pandora Tomorrow</a> having whipped up hopes. This arguably isn't out of character for a stealty sneakfest, but has left folks keen to splinter their cells without much of an idea how things are shaping up.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that with Grivel now back on board, we might at least get a brief morse code message about the state of the remake sometime soon. Otherwise, it'll be more gazing at Ubisoft from afar through tactical goggles, waiting to see if they pull the trigger on releasing the thing.</p>
