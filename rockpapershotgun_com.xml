<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise Of Hydra</a> might release at Christmas according to Khary Payton, who voices the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a> in the upcoming World War 2-set action game. It's the first morsel of release info we've garnered for Rise Of Hydra since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">announcement last March</a>, which tantalised with the prospect of playing USO Show-era Steve Rogers and Azzuri, great-grandfather to the current Black Panther.
</p>
<p>
In the works at Skydance New Media alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amy-hennig-is-making-a-new-star-wars-game-again">an untitled Star Wars game</a>, Rise Of Hydra had been slated to launch in 2025. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Payton suggested that it might be a holiday release, landing after Call Of Duty season and just in time for the nostalgic yuletide period. "We're still working," he hummed and hypothesised. "We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." 
</p>
<p>
I'm not wildly keen myself to play another Marvel game. The expanded Marvel universe as it stands is a kaleidoscopic hangover following the success of the Avengers movies, with no clear heir to the throne just yet. Nor am I especially happy to be back in the shoes of OG Steve Rogers, a recruitment poster character rescued from his own can-do heroism by Chris Evans knowing how to do comedy. Yeah, you comicbook readers probably have a more nuanced take on Marvel's current activities. By all means come at me.
</p>
<p>
I'll forgive Rise Of Hydra all that, though, because Skydance New Media's president is former Naughty Dog creative director Amy Hennig, and she directed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I will forgive Amy Hennig anything, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to brain me with a vase, filch my debit card and blow my life savings on Fantastic Four figurines, I would tell the police not to stress about it, because she directed Soul Reaver. If Amy Hennig were to tunnel back through time and humiliate me elaborately by inviting my favourite Sonic The Comic artist to come see me fall into a cauldron of stale baked beans while being rejected by my primary school sweetheart, I would sob gratefully in the knowledge that one day, Amy Hennig is going to direct Soul Reaver. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps she will even work on another Soul Reaver game, if we can only get her through the Marvel period in her career.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn Remake</a> players are still sharing bug reports with UK developer Ballistic Moon, but there's apparently no one left to respond. “The studio has effectively closed now," one anonymous source told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>An undisclosed number of layoffs were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">publicly announced last September</a>, shortly before the Until Dawn remake's launch in October. According to IG's source, these amounted to "roughly 40 employees". "Around 20" developers were allegedly kept on for post-launch support until they themselves were laid off last December, leaving a handful of employees "at most" alongside studio founders. "There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ballistic Moon were reportedly unsuccessful in their attempts to secure funding or publishers for new projects, despite pitches. New Until Dawn projects with publisher Sony were reportedly "discussed but never came to fruition". That's despite actors Peter Stomare and Hayden Panettiere both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-actors-hint-at-a-sequel-but-theres-reason-to-be-sceptical">making possible hints toward a sequel last year</a>. Original Until Dawn creators Supermassive - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">went through a round of cuts last January</a> - have yet to make any announcements.</p>
<p>"Most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work," write IG, although one of their sources claims that the layoffs followed overtime, and “weeks” of unpaid development work. “Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>
<p>Ahem. Pay your workers. Pay your fucking workers. It's better that no-one does overtime but if they do, pay your fucking workers and pay them well. If you don't pay your workers, you shouldn't ever be allowed to be in a position of power as long as you live. Pay your workers. It would be better if nobody got laid off but if it happens, make sure you've paid your workers. Pay your fucking workers. Pay them. If you don't pay your workers they should be legally allowed to climb in through your window at dinner time and eat the chicken off your plate every night until they've eaten enough chicken to settle the debt. Pay your workers.</p>
<p>Sony and Ballistic Moon have yet to comment on IG's report. We've reached out for comment ourselves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
