            <p>
Our regular PC game round-up column underwent further mysterious ructions during my absence last week, when substitute news chief Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-happening-in-pc-games-this-week-the-maw-may-6-2025">introduced a list format with subheadings</a>. I can only assume he had been driven mad by terror of being eaten by the Maw. Regardless, I will trust his instincts and follow in his footsteps. Here’s what’s coming down the pipe this week.
</p>
<h2>Monday 12th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437570/Chambers/">Chambers</a> is a new Weird West shooter from some of the pustulating greymass behind Golden Light, a game of peerless ugliness. I can’t wait to see what they’ve done to the six-shooters.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 13th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804010/Labyrinth_Of_The_Demon_King/">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a> is a foetid first-person dungeon-crawler set in feudal Japan. Feels like a good pick if you’ve ever wished Onimusha were more like Silent Hill</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/">The Precinct</a> is a top-down 1980s urban sandbox in which you are a policeman fighting gangs. Splash of GTA, obviously, but it also reminds me of grizzly 1999 crime-battler Urban Chaos.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 14th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404470/Animal_Spa/">Animal Spa</a> is a steamy resort for chibi critters that nestles at the bottom of your screen, so that you can watch them bathe while you're doing your tax returns. I don’t think this is going to boost my WPM, somehow.</li>
<h2>Thursday 15th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is "packed with gratifying and chunky violence, but restrictive combat, tedious exploration, and cinematic delusions make for a disappointing follow-up to Eternal", according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-review">review</a>. Shut up Nic, Doom Guy would never betray me</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stylish-roguelite-into-the-restless-ruins-channels-classic-warhammer-quests-dungeon-crawling">building dungeons as you explore them</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503770/House_of_Legacy/">House Of Legacy</a> is a colourful isometric strategy management game, loosely inspired by imperial China.</li>
<h2>Friday 16th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246470/Kulebra_and_the_Souls_of_Limbo/">Kulebra And The Souls Of Limbo</a> is a whimsical adventure game with a touch of stealth and action, inspired by Latin American myths. Your job is to help the shades of the dearly departed find closure.
</li>
</ul><p>

As regards broader editorial happenings: I’m working on some longer-form stuff about survival games and nihilism. Nic is in hot pursuit of a review game or two. He and James are also collaborating on some kind of words-based pub brawl involving Doom: The Dark Ages. Ollie, sheriff of guidestown, has countless plans afoot. I believe some of them involve <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. Graham is busy bossing everybody around and Jeremy has eloped to a strange kingdom called "Holiday".</p>
<p>I don't know what Brendy's doing this week because he was away during the morning meeting, though he did, at least, forewarn us in a Trello note of Take Two Interactive's latest financials on the 15th, which may include updates on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> delay. Perhaps he <em>has</em> been eaten by the Maw. That’d be our 12th victim this month, if so. I’m getting pretty sick of writing letters of condolence. Anyway, what are you up to this week?

            <p>I want <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to be good, and if I had to bet money on it, I'd guess it likely will be. The world is weird right now, and I want both you and me to enjoy driving a car into a man. It very much sounds like it's got Stephen Root from Barry in it! I love Stephen Root from Barry!</p>
<p>But, god, am I feeling some kind of way about it constantly sucking all the air out of the room. It feels less like we're looking forward to a game, more that we're in thrall to a captor that knows it can command attention whether it earns it or not. ( I do not believe <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s excellence earns uncritical hype for all future projects, lest we forget Cyberpunk). There's plenty that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-anti-heroes-of-grand-theft-auto-6-look-sexy-and-dull">can be said about the recent trailer</a>, but if I had to sum up my own misgivings with it, it's that it has an air less of "look at this cool thing we made, we can't wait to share it with you", more dick-swinging swagger, a cocksure sense of, well, you're going to buy this anyway, here's some absurdly good-looking beer to tide you piggies over.</p>

<p>Anyway, the latest news - via a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-09/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-is-impacting-every-game-company">Bloomberg report</a> entitled ‘<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> VI delay impacts every game company' - is that after already having caused various studios to scramble to change release dates, the fresh delay has now caused another round of lighting the panic beacons, and studios are now holding emergency meetings. Here's Bloomberg on a developer that had already delayed their game once to get out of GTA 6's drive-by firing line:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Now they’re caught in a vise. Delaying their game a second time would be an expensive endeavor, ratcheting up the stakes for the eventual release. Then again, trying to come out alongside GTA VI could be catastrophic. But…what if they delay again and then GTA VI slips along with them? There’s no guarantee that May 2026 is a sure thing. The best hope might be to release in March, April or even early May, and hope it’s not disastrous."</p></blockquote>
<p>Bloomberg does suggest that big competition like GTA 6 might not actually have this smothering effect on smaller titles, but the example given is that a single game - the very good <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> - still sold a bunch of copies despite its release coinciding with the Oblivion Remaster. There's no mention of games like<a href="https://x.com/jantonsson2/status/1915115694641090749"> Post Trauma getting "buried"</a> in Oblivion's wake, to the point where the publisher feels <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/1915784451440681375">they need to re-release the game</a>. 

</p><p>Unlike Oblivion's shadow drop, Rockstar have at least given a solid date. These things happen. But I still feel strange about the amount of tumult this as all caused. I actually feel like series devotees are getting off on this cultural dominance, too - red meat eatin', survival-of-the-fittest, my dad can beat up all your dads style. The sports-team-ifaction of game enjoying is not a new phenomena, but it is one that feels like it's <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/marathon-switch-2-very-serious-business-analysis">reaching critical mass</a> to the point where unaffiliated commentators gloating over sales figures can seem more prevalent than actual thoughts about what an actual game is actually like to play. Glory by osmosis? I dunno.</p>
<p>A lot of popular things are popular because they're very bloody good! But there has to a happy medium somewhere, right? The place between stilted water cooler conversations with baffled acquaintances each siloed off into their own niches, and this sort of behemothic, inescapable monoculture? Even if you bloody love a bit of rampant, unchecked capitalism, surely that's built on the foundation that competition is good for creativity? But GTA 6 is so absurdly massive, its dominance so assured, that it leaves no room for competition from the bottom up. It can only terraform and crush would-be hopefuls to dust and drippings from the top down.</p>
<p>There's a decent glug of selfish umbrage in all this, of course. Any non-independent games website is all but forced to report on any new happenings with GTA 6 whether we find them interesting or not, assuming we value our own survival. It all leaves me reminded that any sense of Rockstar being in any way countercultural is surely an ancient, unfunny joke by this point. If it walks and talks and acts like the man, it's the man, and to quote Hatsune Miku, no one man should have all that power.</p>

            <p>I started writing this piece as a sort of "oh, this was cool!" bit of game archaeology after seeing a post from Scott Krol - who shares consistently fascinating bits of ephemera on video and tabletop games - on the physical bits that came with 1984's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy adventure game.</p>
<p>"Infocom, known for their brilliant text adventures, was the first company to put physical items in with their games," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scottrkrol_limited-run-games-just-announced-a-physical-activity-7318076800683708416-wel_">writes Scott</a>. "In fact, Infocom were attributed as the first to coin the term “feelies” for physical goodies that came with the game".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's two great facts for the price of none, that is. The actual bits were excellent too: I'm still not tired of packets that contain absolutely nothing but a label saying there's something invisible or imperceivable inside. If there's more fun you can have with the contents of a cheap plastic baggy I don't want to know about it. You can read more about <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/11/hitchhiking-the-galaxy-infocom-style/">them here</a>.</p>
<p>I say I <em>started </em>writing this piece as that, because I actually found something better along the way, hanging in RPS archives in much the way that bricks don't. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitchhikers-guide-text-adventure-review">Victoria Regan's edition of 'gaming made me'</a> on Infocom's Hitchhiker's Guide adventure game. It's a beautiful piece for many reasons, but two stood out to me especially.</p>
<p>First, Regan's characterisation of human dressing gown Arthur Dent made me appreciate the story's cosmically put-upon protagonist in ways I'm not sure I have before. "His willingness to lie down in the path of an oncoming bulldozer showed courage in the face of randomness," Regan writes, admiring his "stoical response to a sea of surprising events". I wouldn't have used the word stoic or even courageous because I've had the Simon Jones television portrayal of Dent stuck in my head for most of my memory-having life, screaming about jumping up and down on boiled bits of councilmen and threatening to lose his lunch every twenty minutes.</p>
<p>But you know what? I'll buy it. Given Arthur's circumstances, anything north of not just laying on the floor shaking is effectively heroism. I actually really like this framing of the entire story as a battle between Dent's sense of himself as respectable Englishman vs. all the incomprehensible nonsense a vast and futile universe can throw at him.</p>
<p>But my favourite part of Regan's piece is her description of her and her brother's motivation to keep struggling through a famously obtuse adventure game as "the urge to find out what was hidden", a vanishingly precious feeling in an age of games that are not only laid bare moments after release,but also pre-mythologised - by advertising hype campaigns, and also the contemporary incarnation of these same goody-laden game editions - to the point where our own unique personal experiences are all but denied to us, smothered by expectation and iconography (I am not allowed to decide who the Doom Slayer is, this £200 statue has done my thinking for me.)</p>
<p>Most tat is equally impractical, but there's something about these old Infocom feelies that feels less grossly insistent on their value or power. They're humble, almost sarcastic about their own existence. Beautifully useless objects, but also wonderfully un-standard. The standardisation of video game collectibles feels like a natural state for an industry that postures rivalry but actually feeds into itself more often than not: collecting ephemera is vast and messy, collecting statues feels like the sort of thing a bankable demographic might well do. Thus, statues for all. Give me more proud uselessness, I say. More tat that knows what it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
