            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have made clear that they're still very much all-in on the game right now, with adding more stuff to the good shootery thing they've got going being the main focus. That said, the studio's bigwigs have provided a couple of hints at what the future might hold for them, with the latest being that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 is "hopefully many years away".</p>
<p>Also, they aren't fans of players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">voting to rename a city on Super Earth 'Gun'</a>, which is a thing that's been going on in Helldiverland lately.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This rare mention of the next Helldivers game is from Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, who hopped on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1395509386113450106">the game's Discord last night</a>, and was asked to paint a picture of what the next two years of Helldivers could look like.</p>
<p>"I'm very bought into the vision that Micke, Felix, Niklas and Marre (our game directors) and Johan have for the game," he responded, "It's great to be part of the ride. We honestly are focusing on the here and now. HD3 is hopefully many years away." This is one of very few times, as someone who's been covering Helldivers pretty closely over the past year, I can recall Jorjani ever mentioning Helldivers 3 by name.</p>
<p>When he talked about the studio's future on the same Discord server <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-ceo-still-main-focus-next-game-start-slowly-this-year">back in May</a>, he referred to whatever Arrowhead's next project is as "Game 6", which is an altogether more mysterious way to refer to something he said a "very, very small team" would start working on later this year. Meanwhile, Jorjani's predecessor and Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt has very much said Helldivers 3, but only when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-growing-into-helldivers-3-says-arrowhead-cco-pilestedt-taking-design-suggestions-miniguns">suggesting on Twitter</a> that Arrowhead would transform Helldivers 2 into that next game by continuing to update what they've already got on the go.</p>
<p>Nothing in what Jorjani said here contradicts any of that, but assuming the grow-one-game-into-another plan is still on the cards, it's noteworthy that he mentions HD3 by name, rather than just telling folks Helldivers 2's the thing to watch.</p>
<p>Anyway, beyond that, this spot of Discord chatter also saw Jorjani tell another player that the devs have discussed adding support for DLSS and FSR frame generation, but "other more fundamental problems that impact performance" will need sorting first.</p>
<p>Also, he voted for Everlasting Memory in Arrowhead's ongoing poll to pick a new name for the Super Earth city of Remembrance, which players recently helped rebuild via their in-game exploits, and are hellbent on renaming 'Gun' Jorjani joked about Arrowhead possibly naming the city what the studio likes anyway, adding: "I really don't like the name <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gun">GUN</a> personally. but not my decision".</p>
<p>Shooting from the hip there, Mr video game fellow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun]]></content:encoded>
