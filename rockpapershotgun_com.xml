            <p>
The bar for getting me to write up a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> has never been higher. I don't care how many twists you throw into the formula, developers. I don't care how imaginatively you have reinvented the wheel of permadeath and unlocks. I am tired of this genre/wantonly adhesive cultural phenomenon. I wish for it to die in shame and ignominy.</p>
<p>You've made a roguelike in which attacks are performed by assembling a manga page, you say? Well... go on then. Here's a trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>.

"Each turn, you receive new panels," developers Mono Entertainment <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187880/_Manga_Build_Roguelike/">explain on Steam</a>. "Placing them on the page creates your action sequence. Place panels according to the situation, build the ultimate page, and defeat your enemies!"</p>
<p>Taking damage tears holes in the paper, and you can't plug manga scenes into holes, so you'll ideally nobble all your enemies in a single turn, before they strike back. It would be lovely if the pages you assemble made sense and flowed properly as in an actual manga - it looks like there's some repetition, going by the trailer.
</p><p>
How do you unlock new varieties of panel for combat? By means of, amongst other things, "surreal little mini-game events", such as barbecuing fish and confronting bears, possibly because the bears are trying to eat your fish. There are three characters who together form a Streets Of Ragey ensemble. Akira is a hitman who likes guns and punching. Yoko is good at mobile attacks - behold her teleporting in the trailer. And Suzuki is some other kind of assassin who can lay traps.
</p>
<p>
There's a puzzle mode which gives you a limited selection of panels with which to complete an encounter, and a bonus mode in which Yoko and some "playboy" called Yuki have a drinking competition. I cannot read the Japanese dialogue in the gifs, so I can't currently give you any sense of whether Yuki is a massive creep, but odds seem fair.
</p>
<p>Some additional background: Mono Entertainment were founded by a New York University design graduate, and are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393890/IGNISTONE/">Ignistone</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812120/Clock_Rogue/">Clock Rogue</a>. "The Fable" is an actual manga series published by Kodansha, with millions of readers: it's about a super-assassin capable of killing anybody in six seconds, who is trying to live a normal life at his boss's instruction.</p>
<p>
I've just realised that this is one of those dang deckbuilders as well - the manga panels are effectively cards, innit. Those fiends! They snuck that one right by me. Anyway, this one's launching on 5th November, and there's a demo on the way.
