            <p>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek">a press release</a> yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a "strategic move towards publishing games from external partners," according to CEO Martin Walfisz, who says he has let 80-100 people go with "great regret". It's not clear from the release which departments were most affected in this recent wave of layoffs, but judging from the language of the announcement I'm guessing many were employed on the development side of things.</p>
<p>"Shifting focus to external publishing will reduce the Group's fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility," they say, "enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity." </p>
<p>This isn't the first time the company has seen layoffs this year. The first round of job losses came in January and saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">20 percent of the company's staff laid off</a>. But the company, one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_video_game_companies_by_revenue">the largest video games businesses in the world by revenue</a>, said this was not enough.</p>
<p>"Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow."</p>
<p>That negative cash flow refers to the over-investment the company say they've made over the last few years. In May, Thunderful also <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-05-21-thunderful-group-ab-publ-to-divest-the-remaining-distribution-businesses-to-become-a-pure-play-games-company">sold off its distribution companies</a> (they basically distributed Nintendo games in Nordic countries) to patch more holes in their leaky finances. </p><p>What this means for the SteamWorld series, I don't know. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-heist-2">SteamWorld Heist 2</a> was the latest of the studio's games to come out, and - like all SteamWorld games I've played - it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-heist-2-review">thoroughly enjoyable</a>. When the company say they're keeping "some internal development capacity", they may mean they'll focus solely on the steampunky robot world, as regards their own projects. Whereas previously, the various studios now folded into Thunderful Development have made other games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wavetale">Wavetale</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-gunk">The Gunk</a> (those studios previously being known as Zoink and Image &amp; Form). </p>
<p>Considering the habits of big games companies to take fewer and fewer risks in recent years, it's possible they're jettisoning these non-SteamWorld projects first. But that's just my best guess. I've asked Thunderful to tell us more about which projects have been canned, and will let you know if we find out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> autobattler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strategy-autobattler-mechabellum-has-hit-10-after-over-a-year-in-early-access">in September</a>. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/6904675658203398169">Update 1.1</a>’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.</p>

<p>As for how they perform, I’ll have to go ask Graham to give me the rest of the day to test them. For research purposes. And the rest of the patch? I have spent most of my games writing career doing anything I can to avoid the phrase “but that’s not all!”, but since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-me-mechabellum-is-ruining-my-life">I’ve already shilled</a> Mechabellum so hard as to resemble a frothing gameshow host gesturing at a selection of fabulous prices, I think it’s time.</p><p>But that’s not all! That patch also features various balance adjustments for units such as the Sandworm, Arclight, and my beloved Mustang. The latter is now better at intercepting missiles, and since a row of Mustangs was already pretty adept at making Stormcaller spammers weep, this sounds excellent. Stormcallers themselves now hit a bit harder, but have a longer attack interval. There are also a few bug fixes, notably an issue that would prevent sticky oil outside a shield also igniting sticky oil within a shield. <em>And a brand new tumble dryer! </em></p>
<p>Mechabellum was not on our review slate, but I have been slowly chipping away at a full review during downtime, because I feel it deserves one. If nothing else, it’s very solidly earned a place on my personal GOTY list. I would highly recommend looking into it if you’ve ever been curious about competitive RTS but lack the reflex skills for a more traditional pick. Or the time, honestly: you can get very competent at this one very quickly. Not as good as me though, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
