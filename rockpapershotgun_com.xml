            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-founders-of-playdead-are-having-a-legal-war-over-who-made-more-of-limbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Many moons ago, Danish developers Playdead released bleak platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-limbo">proved beyond reasonable doubt</a> that Gamez R Art, while also giving a bunch of witless scriveners massive arachnophobia. Today, we learn that one of the studio's co-founders, Arnt Jensen, is suing the other, Dino Patti, amid competing claims about the scale of his contribution to Limbo. Because of course all great things must end in calamity.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our source of this story is Patti himself, who left Playdead in 2017 after the release of the wonderfully awful/awfully wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a>, and is currently boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/somerville">Somerville</a> developer Jumpship. He and Jensen have famously not been on great terms for years, but things <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">came to a boil in late 2024</a>, when Patti published an account of Limbo's development on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Back in March this year, Jensen argued that the LinkedIn post exaggerates Patti's contribution to Limbo, insisting that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game." He also claimed that the post includes an "unauthorised" photo.</p>
<p>For this alleged infringement, Playdead asked for 500,000 Danish kroner or $72,630 as "suitable compensation and reimbursement." Now, Patti has revealed that Playdead's lawyers are taking him to court in a podcast interview this week with Danish site <a href="https://arkaden.dk/nyheder/dino-patti-der-kommer-en-retsag/">Arkaden</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/limbo-and-inside-studios-new-game-is-a-3rd-person-open-world-sci-fi-adventure/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>For his part, Patti contends that Jensen is trying to delete him from the game's origin story. "Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he declared back in March. "I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." In the Arkaden podcast, Patti is upbeat about the situation, commenting that it's an opportunity to set the record straight, but with all due respect to the guy, that's the kind of thing you say when you're being sued.</p>
<p>None of this interferes with my eagerness to hear about Playdead's next game, "a third person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe", which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdead-reveal-art-for-their-secretive-inside-follow-up">revealed in 2017</a>. At the risk of sounding like I'm picking my favourite dad, I've yet to play Somerville, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">described</a> as an "interesting, if not particularly deep" spin on the Playdead school of apocalyptic minimalism.</p>
<p>I will ask Playdead and Jumpship for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Plus a bunch of other future plans for the foot-to-ball</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the game about kicking it in the goal from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a> devs Sloclap, have launched today, June 19th. The folks behind it have rung in that occasion by outlining a bunch of their future plans, as well as saying they're very sorry you can't currently show off your mouse and keyboard skills by nutmegging some fool who owns one of those ex-boxers.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, crossplay and a bunch of other stuff are in the works for future updates to the foot-to-ball thing Nic and James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-and-nic-kick-a-thing-sloclaps-rematch-edition">dug the beta of</a>, and that currently sits fourth in Steam's top sellers list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kicking off a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch message</a> (sorry, had to), Sloclap explained that crossplay didn't end up happening in time for Rematch's release because of "unforeseen technical complexities", continuing: "We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn’t be available at launch, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>
<p>The devs said they have got a "basic working version from a technical standpoint", and getting that over the line is their "absolute highest priority" right now. So, you should be able to unleash your inner Roy Keane on some unsuspecting fool who bought a different video game box soonish.</p>
<p>Aside from that, SloClap are aiming to show a bunch of technical gremlins that folks reported throughout Early Access the red card (sorry again, I once took a football to the face as a small child and have never really recovered). Lag, stuttering, frame drops, and "player characters and the ball seemingly moving across the pitch unpredictably" are on the hit list.</p>
<p>The devs also have their eyes on a host of improvements and additions for future updates, including tournaments, the ability to create your own club, and bots you can train against. The likes of spectating your squad’s game when you join one and a way to let players team up and rematch with teammates they've liked having a kickabout with are also on the list in terms of social stuff, to go alongside that crossplay. </p>
<p>As for when all of this'll arrive, SloClap made clear not to expect everything by the end of this year, so you may well have to be patient if you've got your eye on one of those non-crossplay additions.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine the devs dribbling through a circuit of well-placed cones that each represent a development thing equal in threat to a six foot four centre back called big Terry whose mum they've just insulted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Parent company Pearl Abyss are said to be cutting their losses</p>

            <p>The owners of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> developers CCP Games are looking to sell it off, according to a report from Korean finance website MTN. Apparently, parent company Pearl Abyss are sounding out interest from a bunch of games publishers, though no names have been named for the moment.</p>
<p>Pearl Abyss - a South Korean outfit otherwise known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-devs-ccp-being-bought-by-black-desert-online-company">scooped up all of CCP's shares in 2019</a> for about 250 billion won, according to the exchange rate of the time. That translates to about $181,139,200 or £134,752,675 in today's money, which is, you know, a fair dollop. You would be pretty chuffed if you found that tucked behind your sofa cushions.</p>
<p>Naturally, Pearl Abyss have been keen to make their money back. According to <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049">MTN's sources</a>, CCP and their affiliates have been incurring sizeable losses instead. They released a mobile game, EVE Echoes, via NetEase shortly after the acquisition, but this has apparently fallen short of expectations, and CCP are now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-awakening-is-born-from-eve-onlines-fragility-so-its-turning-to-the-blockchain">focusing rather heavily</a> on "web3" games fuelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">blockchain bullshit</a>. They are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">still trying to make an EVE Online FPS</a>, despite screwing this up three times in a row.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, the storied and genuinely majestic EVE Online continues to truck along with a <a href="https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility">fiercely dedicated community</a>, who are all playing a vicious meta-game of their own devising I like to call "Backstabbery Betwixt the Space Balkans".</p>
<p>One of the MMO's biggest player alliances, the Imperium, are in the middle of a gigantic operation called The War of the Ruses. During the recent Battle of Lantorn, 3,808 players teamed up to lay 306 dreadnoughts to waste. These are the kinds of losses you enjoy reading about. The ones that emerge from quarterly earnings calls, less so.</p>
<p>While I can only scratch my head at some of CCP's recent doings, I have an enduring fondness for EVE, and am hopeful that its makers will find a way to prosper - whether in the hands of Pearl Abyss or elsewhere. I've reached out to PR representatives for comment on the MTN story. More to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: CCP Games have declined to comment on the story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Battles and map generation have also been revamped</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> is a game I briefly gave a go last year, back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> was still a game we were all yet to play and have a vast slew of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">different opinions</a> about. I thought the little I played was alright, but didn't stick with it that long, slipping back into the pair of comfy slippers that were Civ 6.</p>
<p>Now, though, Ara's just gotten a big update, and it looks like it should solve some of the issues that folks flagged with the base game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dubbed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507330049932791470?l=english">Living Strategy update</a>, this revamp's the first step in a roadmap for the game that was laid out when Stardock Entertainment took the lead on Ara's continued post-launch additions from original developers Oxide Games. It looks like it'll make Ara a bit less frustrating to play.</p>
<p>For example, the revamp takes its name from the default view being switched to a new "Living Strategy" middle ground that aims to balance the up-close perspective on the stuff you're building with the wider strategic overview you'll want when making bigger moves, meaning you should be able to do everything from one perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the patch addresses two of the biggest issues that Sin Vega flagged in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">our review of Ara</a> - the sheer amount of micromanagement required to manually equip buildings and citizens with the stuff from your inventory they need to accomplish certain tasks, and your AI opponents being too easy to outfox.</p>
<p>Now, you've got the option to automate resource selection or control it through policies, meaning you should get less bogged down in just making sure your cities don't grind to a halt. Stardock say AI leaders will "make more nuanced decisions, better optimize their resources and challenge players with deeper strategic considerations", in an effort to ensure you actually face a challenge down the stretch in games.</p>
<p>Skirmishes between you and the likes of bot Otto von Bismarck will feature a new "battle viewer panel" designed to explain fight outcomes and strats more clearly as part of a wider combat overhaul, and map's been upgraded to try and provide more variety in starter setups. Along with those additions and redesigns, Stardock's had a go at making the game run better graphically, gameplay flow more smoothly, and squashed some bugs.</p>
<p>So, maybe worth checking out if you're not happy with where Civ 7's currently at in its own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-next-update-will-make-food-actually-worth-investing-in-and-let-you-play-forever-if-youve-got-that-long">ongoing update metamorphosis</a>, and crave the chance to play dictator/benevolent overlord/person who tells virtual people what to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
