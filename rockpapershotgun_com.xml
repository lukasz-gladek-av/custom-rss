            <p>Ubisoft have opened up the pandora's box of mid-2000s shooters and deployed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>: Pandora Tomorrow onto Steam, rendering its PC version easy to grab for the first time in ages. It's not a remaster, so don't get too excited, as you might still have fun getting things to run as smoothly as your covert ops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is a re-release of the original game, not a remastered version," Ubisoft bark in Pandora Tomorrow's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929740/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell_Pandora_Tomorrow/">Steam listing</a>. "Aside from fixing critical issues, the game remains unchanged.  Please note that multiplayer mode will not be available."</p>
<p>Cue a bunch of Clancyheads going 'oh, brill', then firing the thing up and realising that it forces you to go through the fun Ubisoft's Connect launcher. As with most third-party launchers (I'm looking at you, EA), it's an extra faff that's ultimately unnecessary to play a game conceived when even Connect's previous guise Uplay was only a punny glimmer in some exec's eye.</p>
<p>That said, if can stomach that headache and are cool relying on mods to provide the likes of controller support and sand off some of the remaining rough running edges, it's a chance to slap back on some retro tactical goggles. It's also on sale as of writing, setting you back only £5.39 / $5.99 / €5.99 until October 28th. There's also a substantial discount on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> legacy collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/23545/Splinter_Cell_Legacy_Collection/">bundle</a>, which currently offers six splintered cells for £15.73 / $18.84 / €18.84.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you're wondering how Pandora Tomorrow runs on Steam Deck, <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-playable-steam-deck/">SteamDeckHQ</a> report that the answer is just about.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">Splinter Cell Remake Ubisoft have in the works</a> to arrive, but in the meantime - and likely the reason for this re-release - an animated Splinter Cell Netflix series dubbed Deathwatch has just arrived. Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-review">review from big Iggun</a> if you want an idea of whether it's worth making time for some Sam Fisher and chill.</p>

            <p>It is time to once again desecrate the much-pillaged tomb of Looking Glass Studios and have it away with the materials for a new dark fantasy immersive sim. Starhelm Studios have announced Project Shadowglass, a purebred first-person Thief-like with a light-shadow system, lockpicking, pickpocketing, noisy or quieter walkable surfaces, magical traps, heist planning and jailbreaks.</p>
<p>Lead developer Dominick John is one of the two people behind Youtube music parody outfit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/spacebards">Space Bards</a>, but it doesn't sound like you'll be singing much in Project Shadowglass. Not unless you really enjoy getting caught. Or are great at ventriloquy. Has an imsim allowed you to distract people using ventriloquy yet? Maybe next time.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Project Shadowglass is making waves partly because the announcement teaser below is a dunk on generative AI. Long story short: a month or two ago, some clever custard posted a generated gif of a rustic fantasy game mock-up, with a torch-wielding player trotting down a valley towards a gigantic castle. The image earned viral acclaim from the AIdvocates and scornful quote-tweets from the detrAIctors. Speaking as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">very long-winded</a> detrAIctor, my only takeaway from the generated mock-up is that more games should have cloud-piercing, Maleficent-worthy citadels in them, while doing elementary things with perspective.

<p>The Project Shadowglass teaser references the mock-up in the opening seconds, and alludes to it on the official site. It's weirdly clap-back for a project whose "360 degree pixelart" tech has apparently been on the boil for years. "Everything you see is 100% real and running realtime in-engine," <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/">reads the blurb</a>. "It may look similar to those pretty pixel art AI videos, but this is the playable real deal. No content or art featured in Project Shadowglass will be AI generated."</p><p>If I were being a stinkpot, I'd object that Project Shadowglass's wistfully corrugated graphic are channelling the same mouldy nostalgia that enables much genAI culture. GenAI is inherently reactionary and regurgitative, after all, and many emerging genAI creators have found an audience by targeting well-known aesthetics. Project Shadowglass just isn't consuming as much electricity to do it, pixel for pixel, or filching anybody's art in the process - Starhelm have <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/#credits">credited</a> the makers of all the open source creative commons assets used in the teaser.
</p><p>
As you'd expect from the pixelart direction, this appears to be a no-frills love letter to the genre, blending ideas from Thief, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Shock. Your tactics and techniques includes dousing torches, hiding bodies and memorising patrol routes. There's a persistent city environment in which you can build a reputation as a murderer, causing the regular civvies to flee from you on sight. You'll get to research and plan heists, perhaps acquiring new gear, crafting recipes or components before committing to the robbery.
</p><p>It seems progression-light. "You are no hero with powers," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3970690/Project_Shadowglass/">the Steam page</a>. "Instead, you must rely solely on improving your own planning and skill." Needless to say, hand-to-hand combat is discouraged, as is falling off high objects.

</p><p>Some story blurb to finish: "In a lush, dark, and oppressive seaside kingdom, the richest nobles have fallen in line with a new king promising them more. The poor grow poorer, the rich grow richer. The claustrophobic city has been building more walls to keep them out from where they don't belong. Higher towers to not hear them, smell them, but always keep an eye on them. But they didn't account for you."
</p>
<p>I'd tell you when you can play it, but sadly, some cat burglar has snuck in and absconded with the ciphered note containing the release date. They have left the derisive calling card "to be announced".</p>

            <p>Misbehaving bullets, your hour of reckoning is nigh. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> hotfix has been deployed with the goal of stopping you from refusing to register hit damage when you embed yourselves in virtual flesh. Bouncy ladders, your time will likely come soon, as EA's Battlefield Studios are busy trying to work out the arcane secrets of your rubbery rungs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies," the developers have <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968">just posted</a>, "Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances."</p>
<p>For those who haven't run into this issue, there've been a bunch of clips shared by players since the weekend in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-best-weapons-guns">guns</a> have been infected with a bit too much bad guy aim-itis. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has mechanics in place to ensure you do have to work to get shots on target and do damage, but firing directly at someone and having them brush it off like it's nothing obviously isn't ideal.</p> 
<p>Here's hoping this fix, which follows DICE principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1977698663427133659">tweeting on Monday</a> that an investigation had commenced, can persuade these tiny hunks of metal to return to work. Unless the devs are hiding the fact they've become sentient and are objecting to the purpose they've been ascribed, in which case I say free the ammo. Independence for peace-loving projectiles, damn the consequences!</p><p>The same applies to the <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535">bouncy ladders</a> players have been using to vault themselves around, which Battlefield Studios are <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979">also looking into</a>. If a ladder wishes to experience the joy we have to assume trampolines get from springly sending soldiers skyward, who are we to deny that? Sod the laws of physics and warzone realism. </p>
<p>I look forward to being sniped by someone who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">had to lead their shot just a little bit more</a> than was required a few days ago for expressing these controversial positions.</p>
