            <p>
Capcom and Square Enix announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> would be collaborating with one another, and the first trailer for the former's collab received a proper look in today. It's coming as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game's third title update, so there's more included than just Final Fantasy bits, but that does seem to be the main thing here. So what's included?
</p>
<p>
Well, for starters there's the cosmetics. A couple of Final Fantasy 14 jobs will be making their way into the game, the first being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> reference that is the Dark Knight job. This one gives you a big ole greatsword, and equipping the armour set lets you perform a special action. Then there's Pictomancer, a more recent addition to Final Fantasy 14 that lets you cast different pictomancy spells. It's kind of like you get to do a little cosplay!

<p>
The new monster for this update isn't technically a monster, instead you'll be getting Omega Planetes, a Final Fantasy 14, Magitek-themed enemy that looks like it'll incorporate some mechanics from the MMO itself. Neat! You'll also be able to ride around on a Chocobo instead of a Seikret, and Cactuar will show up along the way somewhere too (including its signature pose).
</p><p>
Outside of the collab stuff, Arch-tempered Nu Udra is showing up in an event quest starting October 22nd and running until October 29, which nets you some fiery-looking armour. The Grand Hub will also get a Halloweeny overhaul too. At the end of the trailer there was a tease for title update four too, which showed a look at Gogmazios (great name), a volcanic-themed monster.
</p>
<p>
Title update three is scheduled for release later this month on September 29th, and title update four is planned for some time in December.

There is perhaps no better thing for a game to have than other, inconsequential things that have no real relation to the main thing for you to do that are entirely focused on mucking about. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> is ostensibly about reaching the top of a mountain all for the sake of a sweet chance of escape, but really it is about doing silly things with, to, or around your friends. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752?l=english">new update</a> has arrived in the game that is, to use the word ostensibly again because I couldn't think of another one, ostensibly about rebindable controls, but here too it's really about doing silly things with friends, things that don't even involve any climbing.
</p>
<p>
Basketball! This is one such way you can pass your time before heading out on your next misadventure. The devs say they "even made it dribble," which I do believe is quite important in this particular sport, I can't be sure, America hasn't successfully forced this pastime onto the UK like it has every other aspect of its culture. There's also chess, a game which I feel in my gut is somehow the spiritual inverse of Peak, but don't have the words to accurately describe this just yet.
</p>
<p>
On the cuter end of things, there's a photobooth in the airport now too, complete with non-functional, prop versions of the game's various items to take pictures with. Oh, and Bing Bong - you've met Bing Bong, right? Great guy, great guy - will now give you a yes-or-no answer after giving him a good squeeze, say for example if you were to ask him if it's a good idea to leap to your death or not. Love ya Bing Bong!
</p>
<p>
There is another big biome update on the way, this was mostly an update to get rebindable controls in (which are exactly what they sound like) with a few extras thrown on top.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up Peak with its new update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have once again addressed the range of performance issues that've come to afflict the shooter, teasing a mid-October update that they reckon should deliver a "noticeable improvement" and outlining that wider plans are in the works in terms of dealing with some larger problems.</p>
<p>Problems with Helldivers 2's stability and general bugginess of the bad kind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">rose to prominence again following last month's Into the Unjust update</a>. Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">quick to admit that the game's performance was "not good enough"</a>, citing "crippling" technical debt as being st the root of some of the more deep-seated issues. At the time, he said the studio would likely prefer not to put out an update focused only on performance fixes unless it was totally necessary, but it appears that might have been deemed to be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs...We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us," reads a tweet attributed to the entire Arrowhead team.
</p>
<p>They go on to tease an update they're aiming to release "mid October-ish", which they reckon "will make a noticeable improvement" in the short-term. As to which problems it'll target/fixes it'll include, the studio listed the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some key crash fixes</li>
<li>Fixed the Primary weapon/Side-arm audio that stops during a mission</li>
<li>Minor performance improvements</li>
<li>Long overdue bug fixes, like Charger footstep sounds (pretty useful) or weapon audio stopping mid mission</li>
<li>No more landing on caves</li>
<li>A Balance Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, Arrowhead wrote: "For some of the bigger performances pieces unfortunately we can’t wave a ‘short-turnaround-magic-wand’, nor would a 60 day patch fix them fully (rather it would be duct tape where we need to solder); so we’re working on a bigger development plan as to how we can address some of the larger concerns."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs.</p><p>We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right…</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1970845182674215225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>They closed out by promising more communication and transparency with players going forwards, something that's long been a bit of an achilles heel in the otherwise admirable job the studio have done in terms of working to sustain their live-service about super service. We'll see if they're finally able to get on top of it this time, possibly by bringing in more folks to help out a community team that from what I've seen already do an awful lot in terms of answering questions and addressing concerns on the game's very active Discord. The issue's generally been the comms which goes beyond that sector of the playerbase, with responses on Discord regularly having to be reposted elsewhere to get word out.</p>
<p>Arrowhead have their hands full from the perspective of new additions to the game too at the moment. They recently had to commit to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">turning off a new strain of Terminids</a> for just over a month in an effort to fix issues with the burrowing bugs.</p>
