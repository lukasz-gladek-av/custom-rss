Paste a map of Uppsala, Sweden to the bottom of your bathtub, fill your bath with extra-bony gumbo, then strap on a scuba mask and rhythmically stick your head beneath the surface, and you'll have something like the experience of playing Solbrand - "a slow burn pseudo-historical puzzle-adventure that'll take you back, down, and more than a little out there." For best results, conduct your bath tub experiment on a day so hot that the sun is literally shrieking. Don't have access to a bath, gumbo, a map of Uppsala, or a shrieking sun? Hey, no shame. That's what videogame trailers are for.

<p>
It's been a while since I've laid eyes on an interface 'em up as swish as this. The gist is that you're the "Spook" in charge of a small marine research vessel, sometime in the distant future. You're navigating a sunken city awash with "scientific breakthroughs and mad eccentrics, restless sea monsters and evil doctors, mythical poetry and long-forgotten gods".</p>
<p>You are here because you need to debunk a rumour about some kind of never-ending bike race, on behalf of "influential offshoots of the first champion", whose "spandex pockets run surprisingly deep". I enjoy this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZeWp1D8MlU">Belleville Rendevous</a>-esque daftness inasmuch as I can't figure out how it synchs with the more familiar cosmic horror devices above.
</p><p>
Based on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772990/Solbrand/">the Steam description</a>, Solbrand plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-other-waters">In Other Waters</a> and, argh, this other underwater mech-based exploration sim with a top-down view that I can't remember - something-naut? Handles a bit like Steel Battalion? Please figure this out in the comments. Anyway, like that, but with sporadic first-person diving bits. 
</p>
<p>
By default, you'll drift across a mildewed expanse of streets and buildings such as the Imperfektum - a real-world student housing complex, apparently - and the Blackened Cathedral. The map nests within a sort of Clancified geode of light-up dials and buttons. You can initiate scan waves that ripple and cleanse the parchment, and adjust depth of field to bring objects into focus. When you want to investigate a location, you engage probe view to swoop in and behold it as a ghostly 3D expanse. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you'll find a document or artefact of some kind, like a semaphore codex or an advert for velocipedes (primordial bikes). If you find human remains, you can "tune into" them to discourse with restless spirits. "Get to know their fates, make bonds, quibble about metre, catch them in lies, and tease out forgotten truths," the Steam page adds. 
</p>
<p>
You've also got a surface-level support crew of living human characters, including a Tinker, Worder and Shimmer. I like this game's language. Here is another excerpt from the lore: "Earth is sunk 'neath the boiling sea, and the sun has made many a mind unusual." That would be the sun that won't stop screaming.

Solbrand doesn't have a release date as yet - no big surprise, given that the project began in April this year. Development studio Dead People Dreaming are actually based in Uppsala, and consist mostly/entirely of Mattias Astenvald, former art director for Indiana Jones And The Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is Astenvald's debut indie release, and a project close to his heart. He himself was born in Skogstibble, a village outside Uppsala, and the game channels his enthusiasm for local history.
</p>
<p>
"There is an unending list of interesting, meaningful, funny, touching, or inspiring marks made by real people and events but that I believe very few know about," Astenvald <a href="https://deadpeopledreaming.com/">writes on the official site</a>." It strikes me how strange it is that in this digital age I can know so much about the goings-on across the globe, yet almost nothing of where I actually live -- despite there being so much that would evidently enrich a life!" The blog includes a chunk of locally-brewed runic verse. I fear I must interview this man. Amongst other things, I'm curious to learn about possible connections with the gaudier archaeology of the Indiana Jones game.
</p>
<p>Closing note: Solbrand reminds me somewhat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stasis-bone-totem">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, though it doesn't seem nearly as icky.</p>

            <p>Ok, that was quick. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has been out less than a week, and no less than two modders have already had a crack at getting multiplayer working in it, so you can take on those pesky bosses with some co-op moral support.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. After all, the Skong modding scene has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">exploded out of the gates</a> with the same level of gusto folks have had for just playing the base version of the long-awaited metroidvania. Then again, it's one thing for folks to be putting out a bunch of smaller scale tweaks that can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-and-tricks">help make things easier</a>, and another for them to turn a one player game into a more than one player game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These first two Skong multiplayer mods to hit the Nexus are the wonderfully named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/73?tab=description">SilklessCoop</a> (if you get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">the reference</a>) by Nek5, and the more 'does what it says on the tin' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/90?tab=description">Silksong Steam multiplayer mod</a> from 233xvx233. Both aim to accomplish the same thing: letting you and a friend load into the same version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> for double the Hornets, and at least be able to see each other as you work your way through the game.</p>
<p>As you can see below, both mods' authors have posted videos proving that you can use their works to do that at the very minimum, though it appears taking on bosses together might still be beyond the early proofs-of-concept. 233xvx233's work does promise "basic pvp" in its description, but the sole clip they've shared thus far doesn't feature any fighting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nek5 has shown off some battling, with a 'main' Hornet and their less saturated buddy jumping around near a spear-chucking foe, but I can't make out the second Hornet actually landing any hits or taking damage. Regardless, even being able to bounce around with your mate's pretty impressive at this stage.</p><p>In terms of setup, SilklessCoop relies on the <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/">BepInEx modding framework</a> and a server utility being <a href="https://github.com/nek5s/echoserver">hosted on GitHub</a>. Judging by the comments section, getting a server up and running for you and your friend can be as tricky a task as playing Skong, even with the description's instructions. Given that, I'd maybe steer clear for now or take it slow if you're a relative modding novice. </p>
<p>As you'd expect at this early stage, the modder also notes some teething issues, like disconnecting mid-session leaving "unmoving duplicates" of Hornet that only disappear when you chance scenes, plus some attack animations going a bit weird. They're also planning to flesh it out with better sync, an arrow to indicate when one of your duo wanders off sceen, and "public servers hosted by me". Though, they do describe that last one as "scary + expensive", which makes it sound like more of a maybe.</p>
<p>The instructions for 233xvx233's mod are a bit more brief and vague, with a BepInEx folder only mentioned in passing amid some game file messing around and the pinging up of an interface that'll allow folks with an official Steam copy of Skong to set up and join a session together.</p>
<p>There's a good chance the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/Extremelyd1/HKMP">the original Hollow Knight's multiplayer mod</a> might be working on their own more advanced version of co-op Skong, but until then it's cool to see other modders experimenting early doors.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3, or whatever they call the follow-up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, may have a social hub in the style of Destiny's Tower, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has told the Helldiverati in a new Q&amp;A.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I realize it's probably never gonna be a thing in HD2, but for the next game I'd really appreciate a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny)," asked one of the assembled Hadesplungers on Discord this Sunday. To which Jorjani <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1414308725400801489">succinctly responded</a>: "It's on the feature list for the next one." Goodness, that sounds rather definitive.</p>
<p>If, like me, you are a closet fascist bully-boy masquerading as a shy and retiring centrist role-playing as an openly fascist bully-boy in a videogame, your mind has immediately gravitated to the prospect of parades. If Helldivers 3 has a social hub with a hefty playercount, then it absolutely needs a parade ground. I've always fancied myself a latter-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheisskopf">Lieutenant General Scheisskopf</a>. I want to be able to turn my head and salute in synch with scores of fellow divers as we strut past the presidential podium.</p>
<p>Come on, Arrowhead, there's a proper minigame to explore here! Let the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> fill their hubs with beachballs and supersoakers. Leave mingleplayer to the hippies who play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>What else do caped brownshirts do when they're chillaxing back at base, or perhaps aboard a proper space cruiser like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rx8_vjbXX4">the ones in Starship Troopers</a>? Well, we could organise our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">Two Minutes Hate</a> sessions, with players gathering to screech and gibber at videos of squid running at a sub-optimal frame-rate. </p><p>Beyond that, maybe there could be an in-game feedback system presented as a 'managed' voting booth, with special cosmetics awarded to any player willing to take up the handcuffs, gavel and taser of a Super-Earth elections officer. Maybe player kicking framed as the denunciation of traitors? Please, fill the comments with your comparably dystopic suggestions. We'll make Jorjani rue his words.</p>
<p>The Arrowhead CEO has previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">Helldivers 3 is "hopefully many years away"</a>, not least because there's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">plenty that needs fixing in Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
