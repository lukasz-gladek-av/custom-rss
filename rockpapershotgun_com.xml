Ho, Lethal Companions! Put down your airhorns, let fall your precious armfuls of plastic fish, and prick up your freakin' ears. Something is coming to 2023's breakout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> multiplayer game. Something that will make the music boxes and springhead marionettes look like child's playthings! I mean, like the child's playthings they already look like, but without the parts that make them horrifying. That something is... to be announced, but I considered the below teaser text pithy enough to be worth a shout regardless.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The new creature is technically maybe the most powerful creature in the game, and the power easily goes to its head," explains appallingly young developer Zeekerss on <a href="https://x.com/ZeekerssRBLX/status/1926872112347722041">social media</a>. "Sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense, just because it can."
</p>
<p>
There is an infinity of enigma couched within the words "sometimes it does things that make absolutely no sense". There are countless things in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> that defy sense-making, not least the game's players, who repeatedly land on emaciated moons populated by giant spiders and ghost girls to harvest rubber duckies and V-type engines, which they then feed to a mouth in a wall. I look forward to experiencing how Zeekerss plans to raise the stakes. 
</p>
<p>
In general, I like the idea of an entity deliberately deciding to do things that seem nonsensical. When we encounter this in other games, we tend to call it an error, depending on our flexible understanding of where the border between sense and nonsense lies. I've always enjoyed reading forum thread attempts to reach across the line and redefine "purely" errant behaviour as plausible. For example, weaving a little mythology around the fact that horses in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> are able to witness crimes. It's because every horse in Tamriel is descended from Horseplay, God of Tattletaling.
</p>
<p>
Lethal Company's thunder has been stolen by, amongst others, the recent R.E.P.O., with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/repo-is-steams-latest-viral-horror-despite-its-high-mate-requirement">"Jim Henson does Nier Automata"</a> characters. Still, it remains a grand and very sociable anti-capitalist chiller. I'm deeply thankful to Zeekerss for engineering a genre of extraction game in which the extraction process is fundamentally cursed. On which note, this news article is now over - please gather up your airhorns and plastic fish and get back to the ship, pronto. Does anybody hear giggling?

My sherry-swilling, moustache-twirling armchair theorist understanding of <a href="https://www.secore.org/en/our-work/all-about-corals/coral-reef-crisis">ocean-wide coral decline</a> is that addressing it will require a, forgive me, seachange in attitudes towards the "natural" realm we generally position as external and other, ripe for the despoiling - a new way of inhabiting and co-constituting this mote caught in a sunbeam, this stargazing planet from which lamentation is spun, this blithe blue impossibility we (but who are "we"???) call home. Failing that, perhaps we can ask some magic Pixar squid to play underwater <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is my fairly jaded introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-below">Life Below</a>, the latest game from Trolls vs Vikings devs Megapop and Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus publishers Kasedo, which I do genuinely find intriguing in that it is trying to do two, somewhat incompatible things.

On the one polyp, it wants to educate players about organisms that, as the PR pitch explains, make up 0.01% of the ocean floor, and yet support 25% of ocean life, with input from marine biologists. On the other polyp, it would hate you to get the impression that it's just here to teach you things. Heavens, no! Life Below is a real-ass strategy management game, whose relatively bizarre pedagogic aspects are kept firmly in check, but hopefully not suffocated by its adherence to genre.</p>
<p>"While the environment and sustainability are important themes, this isn't 'edu-tainment' - this is a <em>proper</em> strategy game," comments the press release, emphasis theirs. They also want it to be one of "the most accessible city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a> ever": Life Below is being created in collaboration with disability consultant Arevya and gaming charity Special Effect UK. 
</p>
<p>
In Life Below, you are a representative of Gaia, personification of Earth's life force. Gaia is often invoked in games with upbeat ecological vibes. I would quite like wholesome gamedevs to spend more time reading about Gaia as originally depicted in Greek myth. In keeping with much of Greek myth, it's an absolute quagmire. Did you know that Gaia spawned Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, using the hacked-off testicles of her husband, Uranus, after she conspired with her son Cronus to have him carved to pieces, in vengeance for Uranus turning Gaia's very body into a kind of cyclops petting zoo? Let's have some of <em>that</em> in games with eco themes, and fewer puppy-eyed jellyfish bois.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how it works is that you send out your twinkling octopus children to cultivate a grid of barren seafloor, planting the equivalent of buildings on resource nodes, and using fixtures such as "seagrass lure" to summon a range of aquatic species to your coral city. You must then keep those lifeforms happy and protect them from threats. The latter include biome change, infestations of creatures who threaten to wreck the reef's equilibrium, and fluctuating algae levels. 
</p>
<p>
The worst nasties, such as oil spills and floating garbage patches, may require the attention of "special wildlife". Without consulting any Wiki pages, I'm envisaging some kind of plastic-eating bacteria who live inside the mouth of a roving basking shark. Not all the external elements are undesirable: sometimes, a nice whale might swim overhead. I'm not sure what the effect will be on your reef. It'll be interesting to discover whether Life Below can translate any of its oceanic learnings into novel mechanics, or whether this is just a Little Mermaid skinpack for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game is out in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932150/Life_Below/">The Steam page is here</a>. Look out for a demo during Next Fest in June.
