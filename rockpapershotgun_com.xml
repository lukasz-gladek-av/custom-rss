There are two reasons you shouldn't watch the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep's</a> just announced DLC Siren's Rest. The first is that, well, it'll probably spoil at least some of the events of the base game given that the expansion is set more than a decade on. The other is for the subset of you that have just the worst case of submechanophobia, because the trailer is absolutely full of man-made objects under water. You've been warned, don't come crying to me if you don't heed me, I'll just say I told you so.

So! Where the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game takes place on an oil rig in 1975, Siren's Rest stays in the same location but moves forward an entire 11 years. With a new cast, you'll be sent to the North Sea to see what's become of the Beira D, using tools like a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera to try and figure out what happened to the crew that manned it. "But beware," a press release teases, "there are things lurking in the depths that even the sea cannot claim." Scary!

Previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> narrative designer Sagar Beroshi has penned Siren's Rest, with Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who) coming aboard as its protagonist Mhairi. She's joined by Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton) and David Menkin (Final Fantasy 16, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>) in as of yet unnamed roles.
</p>
<p>
It's also out really soon! In less than a week in fact, as it's due to be released June 18th, next Wednesday. Doesn't sound too bad for something that essentially sounds like a mini sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-isnt-getting-metal-gear-online-but-it-is-getting-its-own-quite-fun-looking-online-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a>! I'm assuming that's the first thing you thought of when you heard that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is getting an online mode, but I need you to throw that thought in the bin. The MGS3 remake is getting a multiplayer mode, but as shown off in today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> Press Start <a href="https://youtu.be/NXaDgU72gRI?si=EFZz0vU8kfrLvcOb">showcase</a>, it'll be its own, original thing called Fox Hunt.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Fox Hunt is a completely original online battle mode," said mode director Yu Sahara of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> during the showcase. "Although it shares the same worldview of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> Delta, the gameplay is completely different. Perhaps many people will think of Metal Gear Online when hearing about a Metal Gear Online battle mode, but Fox Hunt is different from Metal Gear Online."

<p>
Because specifics weren't shared, I can't tell you how exactly it differs from the original multiplayer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>. One thing that does seem to be a pretty big element of it is an emphasis on camouflage. You can whip out some kind of thing that wraps around your character, and adapts to whatever surface you're sneaking around on.
</p>
<p>
Say there's a brick wall covered in vines - if you go up to it, your camouflage tool will make it look like you're a part of the vines. Or it'll make you look like a clump of rocks alongside a riverbed. It genuinely looks quite effective, and I can imagine it making for some pretty tense matches if you're not looking carefully at your surroundings. More details will be coming at a later date!
</p>
<p>
The showcase also revealed that, ugh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">Silent Hill 1 is getting the remake treatment</a> this time around, with Bloober Team once again at the helm. I'll leave it at that before I go off on a rant about how Silent Hill 1 being so simplistic because it's a PS1 game is part of what makes it so interesting.
