There has never been a time where the presence of a big Hollywood celeb making an appearance in a video game has drawn me in. Who cares! Most of the time they are not voice actors, and are just doing their own voice, maybe sometimes lending their face. And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice-elevenlabs-1236574041/">happily lending his voice to some AI software</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>, a game that's basically just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," co-founder of Exodus studio Archetype Chad Robertson explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Eurogamer</a> when asked if the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past actor was at all AI-generated in-game.

"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used. The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific."
</p><p>
Robertson also touched on what the studio's long-term stance on AI is, which is currently essentially they have none, but will "have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves," as the tech becomes more widely used. When it comes to Exodus, Robertson also clarified that there's no AI to be found in it: "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan."
</p>
<p>
A current lack of AI doesn't convince me of the game right now, personally. There's nothing about it that screams particularly unique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">sci-fi</a>, just perhaps expensive sci-fi, which is often the worst and most boring kind. Still, it's a while away until any of us find out if that is the case or not, as its Geoffies trailer also positioned it for a 2027 release date.

            <p>
It's funny to think that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a>, one of those cosy-ish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafty type of games doesn't have farming just yet, but I suppose that's understandable given it is an early access game. Doesn't matter much either, as farming will be coming to the game next week as part of its Fellhollow update, which just got another look-in through a new gameplay trailer that also shows off all sorts of undead bashing you'll be doing.
</p>
<p>
Where thus far the game has presented a slightly more idyllic fantasy world, Fellhollow looks like it is filled with giant, very indigo orcish brutes, zombie-esque creatures with three flavours of haircut (bald on top, bald at the front, bald), a dragon (it's in the name!), and quite angry skeletons. Well, there's one friendly skeleton that's only a skull who makes a pun so groanworthy not even the strapline of an RPS story would welcome it.

<p>
That aforementioned dragon is a smaller one that appears to appear somewhere in the overworld, though it also looks like you'll be able to do noble battle with a much bigger, sometimes invisible, always with its chest completely cut open dragon that'll probably do a number on you and your mates if you're not careful.
</p><p>
And, of course there's the farming, which sounds suitably in depth. The type of seed your planting will need to be planted in a different kind of planter, ash, oak, or willow. Watering them requires some thinking, as you can either use dirty water from your watering can, or clean water from a well or raincatcher barrel. You can also forgo doing the watering yourself and cast a spell instead. There's even composting! And there are other new spells too like uproot, which as you can probably guess uproots any of your veggies from the ground.
</p>
<p>
It all seems varied enough, and I'm sure it will be enjoyable if you're particularly into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>'s flavour of fantasy. Fellhollow will be available as a free update next week, December 15th.

            <p>
Satire is a genre that you find often enough in mediums like film and television, but there is an argument to be made that it doesn't happen as often in games, and that maybe, this is due for a reckoning. This is the argument that Davide Soliani (Mario + Rabbids) and Christian Cantamessa (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>) are making about the game they're co-directing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bradley-the-badger">Bradley the Badger</a>, a comedic, half-throwback, half-fresh-take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> revealed at The Geoff Keighley Night this week.
</p>
<p>
"The film and television industry has a long history now of parody and satire," Cantamessa told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/this-is-a-love-letter-to-games-first-look-at-davide-solianis-game-awards-surprise-bradley-the-badger/">VGC</a> in an interview that went up alongside the reveal. "In Hollywood, they call it navel-gazing, but it’s healthy, it’s humorous, it’s fun. It opens up some of the dusty closets to the audience, which always has an interest in how the sausage is made."
</p>

<p>
He went on to mention Seth Rogen's recent Hollywood satire show The Studio, noting if the TV industry is ready for that, "and the film industry has Birdman, the comic book industry has Deadpool… I think the games industry is ready for a healthy dose of satire."
</p><p>
This is, perhaps, a bit of an odd framing to take, in that it makes it sound like there has never been any satirical games, though I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Portal, and even arguably much older games like Earthbound might have something to say about that. Hell, let's not forget Conker's Bad Fur Day, a game that Bradley the Badger clearly partially pulls from.
</p>
<p>
To give the game some credit, it does look quite fun! A game about a game falling apart and seeing behind the code so to speak is not a novel concept necessarily, but I like the look of the systems that let titular Bradley be a game dev himself. And it's being more directly satirical of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> and Cyberpunk, which is admittedly not a common thing to do, though I wonder if this didn't have such big industry names attached to it whether it would get away with such presentations.
</p>
<p>
Whether Bradley the Badger will be successful in its satire, or even just being a good game, we'll have to wait and find out, but you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">here</a> if you're curious about it all the same.
