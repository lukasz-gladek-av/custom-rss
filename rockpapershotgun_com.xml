            <p>The future of GZDoom, the community-updated engine behind many thousands of brilliant Doom mods, is in doubt following a bust-up over the lead developer's use of generative AI to create code. The fracas has seen a number of GZDoom developers announce plans to splinter off and maintain their own engine, UZDoom.
</p><!--more-->
<p>New to GZDoom? It's a fork of Doom source port Zdoom, first released by Christoph Oelckers, aka Graf Zahl, back in 2005. A vast number of Doom modding projects make use of it, including such RPS headliners as literary horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">MyHouse.wad</a>, demon-petting add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-doom-mod-finally-lets-us-make-friends-with-the-cacodemons">Cacofrendo</a> (pictured), and unofficial Wolfenstein 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-of-agony-doom-wolfenstein-mod">Blade Of Agony</a>.
</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">GamingOnLinux</a>, a moderator recently posted on Discord about strife between Oelckers and various members of the community. "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom," they write. 
</p>
<p>The fracas appears to be only partly to do with Oelckers' usage of ChatGPT. Going by the chat on Discord and elsewhere, the backlash is fuelled by long-term misgivings about his bulldozing leadership style. Aside from replicating all of GZDoom's features, the Discord moderator post continues, the UZDoom rebels aim to offer "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'". 
</p><p>Further investigation takes us to this <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">Github page</a> for a GZDoom update that features some code by Oelckers, derived from ChatGPT. It has spawned a comments thread full of people arguing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/oct/08/the-ai-valuation-bubble-is-now-getting-silly">the generative AI financial bubble</a> and the ethics and utility of coding with genAI. Oelckers has both defended his use of ChatGPT, arguing that a lot of programmers secretly deploy large language learning models for smaller tasks, and offhandedly invited the angry users to fork the engine and work on their own version.</p>
<p>The ire has spilled over into <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">later Github bug reports</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">this Reddit thread</a> summarising the situation, which includes further postage from pissed-off GZDoom devs. A few Doom modders have also been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/himynameischair.bsky.social/post/3m36lqd7kbc2s">airing their</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m36nql4u3c2l">grievances</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can only scratch my head and look worried at a lot of this. I know eff-all about the twists and turns of GZDoom's long development - I am one of those drive-by Doomlites who downloads a cool wad every blue moon. Still, it all feels rather momentous, given the sheer number of projects that use the engine. More to follow, I'm sure.</p>

            <p>Around the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release, the Metroidvania's Simplified Chinese translation was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit stilted</a>, with Team Cherry quickly promising to rectify the "quality issues". They've aimed to take the first step in doing just that with the game's fourth patch, which is now live in Steam beta with a fresh translation, but early impressions from players are largely negative.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to Team Cherry, they have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/">made clear</a> that the fresh translation which has arrived with the beta release of patch 1.0.28954 is a "basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback". They added that "implementation of this new translation is not yet finalised, so please expect some display issues throughout." There's a <a href="https://teamcherry.notion.site/12c63da3a1a780f4a8cfd8441a243a6e">bug report form</a> via which folks can leave feedback on the revamped wordage.</p>
<p>A fair few Chinese players have also opted to leave early feedback on the translation in comments on the patch post, and these verdicts are far from glowing. While it seems the original translation's classical grammar might be gone (though the comments offer mixed views on that), fresh problems are being reported, with place and NPC names seeming like the main sticking point this time around. The Deep Docks in particular <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/#c506216918921801406">are cited</a> as now being referred to by a spoliery name.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your efforts in translating Chinese," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=4#c506216918921814502">one of these comments</a>. "I have always been a fan of yours, but the new beta version of the translation has obvious shortcomings. The main problem is that the new translation version has changed the translations of place names and NPC characters that were originally well translated and recognised by most players. I hope the new version of the translation can keep the original NPC and place name translations, and make the dialogue and background introduction text more readable and understandable."</p><p>Team Cherry have been quick to acknowledge this initial feedback. "Thanks so much to everyone who's been sending in comments and concerns on the Simplified Chinese translation in public-beta," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=5#c506216918921817500">comment of their own</a>. "They've been a huge help. Two quick notes from us: We fully agree with comments that the names of characters, places etc, should generally remain the same as in the original version. Only a few specific names should be considered appropriate to change - those where the current translation is confusing or incorrect. We won't be releasing any translation that isn't up to the community's standards, and we'll continue to closely monitor feedback from fans."</p>
<p>Outside of this revamped translation, this beta version of patch four features a "short set of game fixes", set to be added to before full release. Among them are a switch to Unity's input system aimed at improving controller support and an update to the multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots.</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry are able to get a handle on these persistent translation problems soon.</p>
