            <p>
There is only so big a sigh I can let out at, well, everything that Ubisoft are doing currently. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelled a number of its games</a>, notably the Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposing up to 200 job cuts at its Paris HQ</a>, all of which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">led to a call for an international strike</a>. Now, it sounds like Ubisoft have also cancelled an online Assassin's Creed game.
</p>
<p>
This comes from French outlet <a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/">Origami</a> (as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-rumored-cooperative-multiplayer-assassins-creed-game">IGN</a>), who said sources they spoke to confirm the cancellation of a project codenamed AC League that was being developed by Ubisoft Annecy. Apparently the game was originally planned as a piece of DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the Japan-set most recent entry in the series. It would have seen four assassins working together on a number of missions, supposedly concluding the story that would have unfolded over the game's season pass.
</p>
<p>
It wouldn't have just been a one off either, as the plan was to use this to build other multiplayer experiences in future games. But directors at Ubisoft Annecy felt uncertain about League being attached to Shadows, ultimately concerned over it taking too long to develop. This resulted in the decision to turn it into a standalone game using bits of Shadows' map, with the intention to host an invite-only alpha as soon as May of this year. Except, well, as mentioned, it's been canned, something Ubisoft Annecy was only told last week.
</p>
<p>
According to Origami, a few Annecy staffers have been tasked with using the technical advancements the team made to make it easier to add multiplayer modes in future games. However, those left with no project to work on currently feel unsure of what is next for them, given Ubisoft's recent actions. As always, solidarity to those affected.

            <p>
I am very much of the opinion that for the most part, video games do not have a very good relationship with food. There are plenty of games where you can eat food and get some delicious HP back for it, but rarely is food the focal point narratively. So, ever since its announcement I've been quite excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dosa-divas">Dosa Divas</a>, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you play as two sisters piloting a cute robot whose goal is to take down an "evil fast food empire." And I'm more excited now, as it has a release date!
</p>
<p>
Unlike that one meal you ordered at that one restaurant all the big TikTokers said was really good, actually, you won't have to wait long either, as it's set to release April 14th, less than two months away. Not only that, it has a new demo for you to have a fiddle with, which I did. It's neat! But also very much the beginning of an RPG, where your movesets are limited, so you don't get a real feel for its full potential.
</p>
<p>
There is a dedicated cooking mechanic too, where you mix and match different ingredients for various kinds of dosa. The quality of the final result differs depending on how well you do sort of quick-time events, which admittedly isn't the most engaging thing in the world, but is better than just going through a menu and the game pretending you've made something to eat.
</p>
<p>
Where it pulls me in is its story, as there is clearly an emphasis on the act of making food that understands what a personal thing it is to do. I'm curious to see where it ultimately ends up in this hyperbolised world where everyone is forced into eating ready-made meals, though I can already feel that at least one of the lessons learned will be of the joys of cooking.
</p>
<p>
While you wait for developer Outerloop Games to add the final bits of seasoning, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950710/Dosa_Divas/">here</a>.
