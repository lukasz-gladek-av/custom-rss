            <p>A group of prominent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> modders will be livestreaming the creation of a big mod over a single weekend later this month. It's part of a charity drive led by voice actor Wes Johnson, probably most famous for providing the dulcet tones of mad Daedric prince Sheogorath in Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.</p>
<p>The gang - led by Kinggath and the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> - will be letting viewers decide the specifics of the mod via a stream this weekend, with the actual mod creation streams then taking place on Twitch across June 28th and 29th.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">The modathon</a> is part of this year's edition of Voiceapalooza, an annual charity drive in aid of the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> that sees Johnson and community-run charity initiative <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/">Fallout For Hope</a> organise a bunch of streams to raise funds for the cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-sheogorath-actor-charity-2024">Last year</a>, this time-limited modding element of it saw a similar group of modders create a Fallout 4 questline called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389">Shady Motives</a>, raising over $30,000 in the process. In addition to a story starring Johnson, who's also voiced the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s Fawkes and Oblivion's Lucien Lachance, that mod included a player home, custom weapons and armour, and a fully-voiced companion.</p>
<p>So, basically a mini-DLC worth of stuff that was then uploaded to Nexus Mods and <a href="https://mods.bethesda.net/en/fallout4/mod-detail/4364063">Bethesda.net</a> once any kinks were ironed out for anyone on PC or Xbox to give a go. This year looks like it'll produce a fresh mod of a similar size and scope, with modders Kinggath, Elianora, Neeher, Jazzhands, Otellino, Sagittaurus, Niero, Erika Ember Studios, Veta Phoenix, and greenFoxel all set to stream themselves creating and working on different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Interesting to check out if you've ever been curious about how the modding sausage is made, or you can just keep an eye out for the mod going live once it's done. There's also a stream on Kinggath's Twitch that'll see watchers vote to decide the details of the mod that the group'll be building - that takes place this Saturday, June 14th, kicking off at </p>
<p>You can find all the timings for the different streams that make up this modathon in <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">this Tweet</a>, and find all the streams that'll be going live on mod-making portion on June 28th <a href="https://simsettlements.com/charity/">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
