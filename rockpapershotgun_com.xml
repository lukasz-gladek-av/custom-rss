Anyone up for a little shindig? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> clearly are, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>' second season is all about the Hellfire Gala, a fun little party gone wrong hosted by Emma Frost. As you'll no doubt be aware, Emma Frost isn't in the game currently, making her the first of the new characters to join this season, which kicks off next week, April 11th.

<p>
The Hellfire Gala is actually a story from the comics, set on Krakoa, a living island where mutants live, with the whole gimmick of this season being that everyone and anyone is invited for a big ole party.

That gets rudely interrupted by the second new character of the season (who'll be coming a bit later), Ultron, who crashes the party by saying that man and mutant "will be exterminated." Here's the thing I can't get over though: he really sounds like a bloody Dalek. That choice to have him say "exterminated" can't be a coincidence, right? He just sounds like a Dalek that's trying to deepen its voice so that it sounds a bit tougher. Not quite the sultry tones of the likes of James Spader.

<p>
You can also spot a number of characters in new costumes you'll inevitably spend way too much money on, like Wolverine in a white tux, Storm with some vividly blue hair, Magneto cosplaying as a Space Marine, amongst a few other mutant and non-mutant characters.
</p>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/LOuv0tO_aLI?si=_lYN36-L8wO5KKcp">new Dev Vision</a> was shared today too, offering some more details on what lies ahead for the game. For one, from season 3 onwards, a new hero will debut every month, which just sounds like overkill if you ask me. There's also mission adjustments coming, new colour options for popular costumes, the ability to gift costumes to friends, new team-ups, and a bunch of adjustments. You can check out the video for specifics!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
