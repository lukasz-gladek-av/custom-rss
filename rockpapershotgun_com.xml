            <p>Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mike-laidlaw-leaves-bioware">a number</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-lead-casey-hudson-returns-to-bioware-as-general-manager">of</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/david-gaider-bioware-dragon-age">seasoned BioWare developers</a> across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.</p>
<p>Summerfall appear to be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/summerfall-studios-on-life-after-stray-gods">prospering</a>, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-cant-outfly-the-stark-realities-of-the-industry-as-creators-inflexion-close-uk-office-and-lay-people-off">experienced hard times</a>. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">"paused operations"</a> without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.</p><!--more-->

<p>I've yet to play the demo - it's just gone live, and I wanted to bang this out before the end of the working day - but I quite like the looks of Eternal Strands, emphasis on the "quite". It's a bright and breezy, hub-based fantasy action game in which you play a brawny battlemage who can kindle self-propagating wildfires, build ice bridges, and toss around breakable boulders with telekinesis. You're a Dragon Age Jedi, basically, with a pinch of Shadow Of The Colossus and ooh, Zelda's free-climbing in the bargain.
</p><p>
All those obvious parallels may suggest a project with no real identity of its own. It doesn't help that the visual direction feels a bit soulless - too clean and chunky and rounded for my liking. But I am willing to forgive all that if Eternal Strands succeeds at fulfilling what I hope is its secret agenda of capturing the spirit of mid-tier noughties action games with gimmicky real-time physics systems. Games like The Force Unleashed and Psi-Ops. Where my Psi-Ops fans at? I can sense the restless ghost of Midway in how Eternal Strands lets you freeze a golem's feet to the floor, then smash it over the head with the nearest tree.

The demo gives you two areas of the game's world, aka the Enclave, not including a basecamp area that populates with quest-giving NPCs and facilities in the course of the campaign. The demo includes the crafting system with three base weapon types - sword and shield, bows, and two-handed weapons, together with a selection of magic spells. It's apparently playable on Steam Deck but not yet verified, and your demo progress will carry over to the full game.
