            <p>Of all the "what if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but" projects on offer, there are surely none so atrocious and indecent, so utterly irresponsible of conception and offensive to human dignity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/birdigo">Birdigo</a>, which bills itself as "what if Balatro, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wordle-past-answers">Wordle</a>". For the uninitiated, Balatro is the rad poker roguelite that took the games industry by storm in 2024, while Wordle is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3lcj645f27c24">what the New York Times do now</a> instead of articles.</p> <!--more-->

<p>Before you NYT sympathisers accuse me of riding far too high on my already stratospheric high horse, let me confess that a significant percentage of Rock Paper Shotgun's daily eyeballing comes from Wordle guides. I'm not saying that I sleep on a bed of Wordle guides, but if I had to stuff a mattress with any RPS content, it would be that. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>. The idea of these two games forming one game makes me feel like I'm watching a stellar collision, and that's before you consider the birds. Combine Balatro and Wordle, and you get birds. These are the puns that cause our parents, children and employers to stop talking to us.</p>
<p>Birdigo is the brainspawn of John August, scriptwriter for Corpse Bride and Charlie's Angels, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bonfire-peaks">Bonfire Peaks</a> developer Corey Martin. Apparently it all started on a podcast. Nothing honourable ever begins with a podcast. The basic mechanic is assembling letter tiles to make words, which earn you "flaps" with which to fly a flock of fidgety, boggle-eyed wildfowl around the world. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3264170/Birdigo__bird_word_game/">The Steam page</a> acknowledges Scrabble as a third influence, here. If they were <em>true</em> artists, they'd have incorporated that into the title pun, but I guess they couldn't think of a SFW narrative theme for a game called Birdigrabble.</p>
<p>The Balatro element, meanwhile, takes the form of multipliers and modifiers which let you jimmy the basic scoring system. "Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses," the Steam page comments. "Use enchanted feathers, letters and songs to change the rules of the game as you go." All japes and jeering aside, I think this is probably quite fun. It's out 30th July, and you can find a demo on Steam.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-end-is-nigh-for-balatro-and-wordle-have-had-a-terrible-avian-child]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/">Time Flies</a>, the latest wonderfully weird game from Swiss devs Playables, will turn you into a fly. I mean, the clue was in the name. You live for a matter of seconds every playthrough, and in that time, you've got a bug bucket list of stuff you can do.</p>
<p>You'd better not screw around. Or you'd better get on with screwing around. Either way, this cool cousin/sibling to the equally bizarre <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fine-2018-games">Kids</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-my-exercise">My Exercise</a> is coming out on PC July 31st.</p>

<p>"Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die," reads Time Flies' Steam description. It's not wrong. It's hand-drawn world has "delightfully accurate fly physics", "numerous intriguing ways to die", and "grimly variable life expectancy based on player location".</p>
<p>If you want more info on that last part, artist and director Michael Frei explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/time-flies-lands-on-ps5-on-july-31/">PS Blog</a> that how long a playthrough of the game lasts depends on what average life expectancy according to the World Health Organization is in your region of the world. For example, if you're in the US, the game'll register that figure to be 76.4 years and give you 76.4 seconds to play before your fly dies. So, it looks like those of us in the UK'll be getting <a href="https://data.who.int/countries/826">about 80.1 seconds</a>.</p>

<p>In that time, you can accomplish bucket list goals by doing everything from getting drunk, to learning an instrument, to making someone laugh, to reading a book. Or you can try to find god, something Frei discusses in that blog post. Or you can just roll with it.</p>
<p>"What to do in this world before you die? That is a difficult question to answer," Frei wrote, "Luckily, the game contains a list of things for you to do. All you need to do is figure out how to do them, and then do them all within one lifetime. It might seem impossible at first, but you can die trying, and eventually you’ll get the hang of it. It is a game about life, but you get many chances."</p>
<p>Sounds equally filled with fun and existential dread to me, and I'll definitely be adding it to my list of things to do before I eventually expire, likely just before getting to the DLC in my millionth Fallout New Vegas playthrough.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/time-flies-is-about-a-bug-finding-god-or-learning-guitar-in-something-like-764-seconds-and-its-got-a-release-date]]></content:encoded>
