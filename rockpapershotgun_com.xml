            <p>Avast, fellow salty sea-dogs. Some legally-minded landlubbers may have had words with Edward Kenway, captain of The Jackdaw and protagonist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a>. Well, Kenway's voice actor Matt Ryan at any rate, who's been filmed at a convention saying that Ubisoft threatened to sue him over a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">previous video from another convention</a> in which he teased a remake of the game.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, this is the Black Flag remake the publisher haven't confirmed is coming, but has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I don't know, mate," Ryan said when asked about said remake in this latest instance of a convention goer pointing a phone at him while he signs stuff. "Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [points towards the phone filming this exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. Then the company threatened to sue me. So, [now] I say nothing."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear whether Ryan's unaware he's being filmed this time around, as he does directly acknowledge that the convention goer who's doing so has their phone camera pointed at him. This latest clip was originally uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> and since looks to have been taken down there, but not before it was reposted onto what remains of Twitter.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didnâ€™t realize he was being recordedðŸ˜µ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>â€” The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>We've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>It's not nice to hear about anyone allegedly having Lionel Hutzes on their case over something like this, so here's hoping Ryan doesn't end up in any more hot water over this latest clip. If you approach him at a convention with your phone pointed right at his mug in the near future and try to chat Black Flag remakes, I'd expect he might have less to say.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, so. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">supposed to go</a> as follows: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-4-remaster">Yakuza 4 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-5">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>, then off into full-blown Like A Dragon land, and on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</a>. Easy. Except right now in my Steam library, it's not. The Kiwamis are cheekily lurking behind Yakuza 6, and the LADs are before all of their more Japanese gangsterly-named siblings.</p>
<p>It's chaos and anarchy. I can't live like this. The good news is that thanks to the update Steam's Client Beta has just gotten, it looks like I'll no longer have to.</p>

<p>"Added a customisation tab to game properties," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/545616353498759462?l=english">the notes</a> for it read, "The customisation tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library."</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://x.com/chibilawl/status/1951056729778823585">many</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1meelqh/theyre_finally_doing_it_oh_my_god/">many</a> folks who've been frustratedly looking at the alphabetically misbehaving names in their library letting out a big sigh of relief. To be clear, the custom name you add won't overwrite the game's display name in your library, it's just hidden away behind-the-scenes, letting the storefront's inner workings know not to put 2016's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> above 2013's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of that, this Client Beta update's all about useful but unglamourous fixes for various issues you might run into when Steaming. Some are specifically aimed at big picture mode, recording games, and Linux, with a good chunk of them being interface-related.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top genres list in the store menu should now be "more relevant and dynamic", which I assume means you'll know in an instant if Steamers all over the world suddenly get way more into shmups.</p>
<p>If you've taken one look at the new sorting powers on offer and are currently salivating at the prospect of getting your librarian on, instructions to opt into the Client Beta can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order]]></content:encoded>
