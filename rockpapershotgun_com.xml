            <p>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ved-purification">VED: Purificatio</a>n, a free prologue demo to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> VED, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190370/VED_Purification/?curator_clanid=45226842">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, fine, here’s a non-neutral assessment: the voice acting is as rough as the cheap Asda cat litter I bought that was so close to gravel in consistency that I refused to subject my pet to it, so that’s bonus points to the art for carrying my interest. This one’s a turn-based RPG, but with cRPG elements like dialogue choices, multiple endings, and a series of intriguing ‘curses or blessings’, which sound somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>-like. There’s dice rolls and ability loadouts, and most importantly, the gifs on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182420/VED/">Steam page</a> for the main game feature at least one very good giant mushroom bastard. Here’s how the game describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>In VED, you take on the role of Cyrus, a young hero who comes to the city of Micropolis in search of a new life. There he suddenly discovers the ability to teleport between two interconnected worlds full of mysterious flying islands, strange creatures, and dangerous monsters. Unfold an interactive story where each decision matters and help Cyrus discover the truth about this magical place, so that you can decide the fate of two worlds. To succeed in your quest, you will have to master the powerful magic of the Veds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just once, I would like a game to just come out and tell me in the marketing that “only about one third of the decisions you make matter”. Would you not just buy that game immediately, purely out of respect for its honesty? I would. I haven’t played VED of course, so maybe each decision does matter, and maybe “easy to learn but difficult to master” is an accurate description of the combat, too. Who knows! The full game’s out in a week anyway. That’s the 14th of November, and your prologue progress carries over to the big release, should you find yourself a dedicated VEDhead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When multiplayer fishing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> came out last month, it offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs</a>. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

<p>That's in-game money, of course, earned by selling your catch. Not actual human dollars. But it's still a comically large price tag when compared to the other titles in the game, which generally cost $75. To declare your heterosexuality is now the most expensive thing you can do in the game. Nevertheless, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625852883021083340/">complaint from a bitter user</a> on Steam demanded a "straight" title, and that is what they got. What's funnier is that the title comes in quotemarks. So you're not straight, you're "straight". </p>
<p>I'm straight. I also find this incredibly funny. As a glib response to a bad faith complaint, it's perfect. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3146520/discussions/0/4625853246786774999/">another player asked</a> if non-binary items of clothing would make an appearance. In that case, a non-binary title and an accompanying t-shirt were simply added to the game. </p>
<p>All these additions come as part of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3146520/view/4467101633890746444">big "housecleaning" patch</a> that fixes bugs and adds other features. Other titles now available  include "creature" and "cryptid". I'm currently sporting "critter". </p>
<p>Plenty of non-cosmetic changes have been made too. Fishing on ripples in the water now gives you a larger chance of catching better fish. There are multiple save files now, meaning you can rock more than one avatar. Some items can be stacked up to 99. The inventory menus have been reworked. One note in the changelog simply says: "Added the ???????? which is accessed through the ???? ?????? and ??? ????????" - colour me intrigued. There are also now 18+ lobbies to try to ensure chat is safer for young players. (Although all this means is that players have to accept a pop-up when joining 18+ servers. Not exactly perfect but better than nothing.)</p><p>"The launch product was rushed and a bit of a mess," said creator "lamedeveloper" in the update post, pointing out that the entire development time of the game totalled just 5 months. "I ended up not really being proud of the product I had put out. Hopefully, this patch addresses most of the major issues with the game (and I can finally sleep a bit)."</p>

            <p>A few months ago, the rumour took root that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s release date would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">slip back from 2025 to 2026</a>. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">a full return to in-office work</a>. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">a fall 2025 launch in March</a> and have just doubled down on it in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">their latest financial briefing</a>, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked how Take-Two work out a game's release timing by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html">CNBC</a>, Zelnick commented that "there are elements that you can actually measure, for example the number of bugs in a title, and every one of us will make sure we have as few bugs as possible before we launch.</p>
<p>"However, in the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs," he went on. "It's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p>
<p>CNBC were not appeased by these scintillating philosophical <em>bon mots</em>. They pressed ahead, asking Zelnick how confident he was in the fall 2025 timing, given that it wasn't so long ago that Take-Two had GTA 6 pinned for 2025 at large.</p>
<p>"Well, there is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Zelnick replied. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p>
<p>Here's another GTA 6 release snippet by way of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/">Variety</a>, who had their own interview with Zelnick. In this latter chinwag, Zelnick commented that the game won't release at the same time as Borderlands 4, due between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026, because "it's safe to say that we wouldn't, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily." I think it's also safe to say that if it came to a conflict over launch windows, Borderlands 4 would be the one to make room.</p><p>The fall 2025 release only covers the game's console showing, of course. Take-Two have yet to spill the beans about the GTA 6 PC release date, but Zelnick did say in an earnings call last night that they're feeling pretty good about PC support in general.</p>
<p>"The audience is going to show up if you have great properties, so we just have to make sure to be on an array of platforms," he said, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-publisher-says-it-isnt-complicated-for-us-to-support-pc-and-great-cool-so-wheres-that-gta-6-pc-announcement/">Gamesradar</a>. "If one platform diminishes in value, there's always another one.</p>
<p>"We're seeing great growth in PC right now, for example. I have been of the view that open formats would continue to grow and PC is an open format. I do think PC will continue to be a more and more important part of the console business going forward, and that isn't complicated for us to support at all. So the bottom line is, we are selective about which platforms we support. We make the tech work when we can make it work, as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile."</p>

<p>If I had been present during that CNBC interview, I would have asked Zelnick what he thinks of the fact that GTA 5 players are obsessively trying to predict the next GTA 6 marketing beat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-fans-desperate-for-an-october-reveal-are-convinced-rockstar-are-trolling-them">based on the phases of the moon</a>. This has blown up again on reddit lately because somebody's realised that the Tom Petty song from the GTA 6 trailer, above, has the words "wait for the moon" in it.</p><p>I would have asked about this in the few seconds before somebody spotted the rando Britisher lurking behind the green screen and phoned security. "TELL ME ABOUT THE MOON, STRAUSS," I would have bellowed, as huge men in tuxedos dragged me away into an unmarked van.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
