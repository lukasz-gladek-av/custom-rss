            <p>Your cuddly dinosaur aunties at Capcom have warned that they can't "guarantee" various Monster Hunter games will run on Windows 10 PCs after uncle Microsoft end support for the operating system on October 14th this year.
</p>
<p>When that fateful day comes to pass, Capcom "will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will run on Windows 10 systems." Which isn't to say that these games will immediately become unplayable, but "future system updates or game title updates may make the game incompatible on Windows 10 systems".
</p><!--more-->
<p>The developers add that if you have trouble with those Monster Hunter games on Windows 10 PCs after October 14th, "support can only be provided based on information from before support for Windows 10 was discontinued", as they'll be discontinuing services for investigating problems when playing on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of Windows 10 being sunsetted/given the old heave-ho/left crying by the roadside, Microsoft have said that Windows 10 apps and drivers will continue to boot and run normally after the cessation of official support, but you won't get any more free security updates, bug fixes and big feature updates. 
</p>
<p>It's not quite as cut-and-dried as that in practice. Microsoft 365 apps running on personal and commercial Windows 10 PCs <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/">will get security updates until October 10th 2028</a>, and feature updates until August 2026.
</p>
<p>The lack of security updates is the major concern for me. Microsoft are offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates">paid extended security update subscription</a> for people who want to maintain Windows 10 beyond the cut-off date, with availability dependent on region and which version of the OS you're running.
</p><p>Windows10mageddon threatens to leave a lot of PC users in the lurch, though there's a certain amount of Y2K-style hysteria about the fallout. According to <a href="https://www.controlup.com/windows-11-readiness/">one study</a>, around half of Windows PCs still don't run Windows 11. If your machine doesn't have the specs for Windows 11, it seems like you'll need to buy a fresh one. I expect there will be plenty more bulletins from game publishers encouraging players to update their systems.</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4"> Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a>'s latest trailer, in which an entire nerd cave's worth of miniatures spanning all four in-game factions are gibbed, gutted and burned in about 90 seconds. 
</p>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, this is the first time I've watched a Warhammer videogame and tried to calculate the bodycount in terms of tabletop figurine prices. My pen-and-paper estimates are profoundly upsetting, and that was before I looked at Games Workshop's current catalogue - I think for the first time since 1999 - and adjusted my figures for inflation. Do any of you play physical Warhammer tabletop games right now? How does that balance out, exactly? Do you just sort of... not buy food?

<p>Anyway, traumatic spreadsheeting aside, this is a heck of a trailer. The Blood Angels hit the stage first and are immediately waylaid by the Orcs, who are themselves flanked by the Adeptus Mechanicus, who are then pounced upon by the Necrons. It's like watching four drunk cosplayers trying to pull off a barbershop quartet, but then somebody elbows somebody in the codpiece, and it rapidly descends into a squelchy scrum of people slurring "FOR THE AMPERSAND". We also get to see a bit of base-building, along with plentiful glimpses of the HUD.
</p><p>With Dawn Of War 4, new developers KING ART Games aren't so much angling forward into the grimdark future as harkening back to Relic's original Dawn Of War. They've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dawn-of-war-4-is-a-modern-interpretation-of-dawn-of-war-1-with-some-cool-adeptus-mechanicus-er-mechanics"> shared a bit</a> about how they're building on the first game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> mechanics, while largely avoiding the subject of Dawn Of War 3. The new game is out in 2026.</p>

            <p>
Based on time of day and year, global fertility rates, and our own secret, illegal research into RPS supporter breeding patterns, I calculate that there's a 12% chance you are reading this while carrying or cradling a small child. If that's the case, then: what on Earth are you doing here? We post all kinds of awful grown-up things on RPS. Mark is threatening to do another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">salacious mod article</a> and just this very morning, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-final-fantasy-tactics-vr-free-alien-wooden-mice-mazes-and-opulent-card-games">posted</a> a picture of a xenomorph covered in blood. 
</p>
<p>
This piece should be safe for kids, however, as long as you don't explain what a xenomorph is or what "salacious" means. It's about Messenger, a free browser-based game in which you run around a very small 3D watercolour planet, delivering post. I suspect you and your child will enjoy it, unless we've already corrupted them and you're now playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-fireteam">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Created using WebGL, Messenger is from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">Short Hike</a> school of vibes-driven pocket worlds with gentle to-do lists. The controls consist of moving with WASD and jumping - more of a lazy hop, really - with space bar. You've got a few deliveries to make off the bat, and you can take on more assignments by chatting to people. 
</p>

<p>
The dialogue writing is quite spry. I delivered a letter to a bald man which turned out to be from his past self. "Take care of your hair," it read. Sad trombone. You don't really need an objective, mind: it's enough just to amble down the road and watch the horizon unroll. There's also the option of customising your outfit, and an emoji system for communicating with the other players - yes, those are other players! - who pop into your session at random.
</p><p>
<a href="https://messenger.abeto.co/">Find Messenger here</a>. Try not to get it confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-the-messenger"><em>The</em> Messenger</a>, an upsettingly hard game about ninjas. It's kind of ridiculous that this kind of game now hums along in a browser, isn't it? Imagine that it's 2000 and you found this on AOL - your head would asplode. Your modem would probably asplode, as well. "Asplode" is a reference to noted early noughties comedy website <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a>, by the way - your kid likely isn't old enough for Strongbad yet, but it's the kind of thing they'll love when they start school. Better than the rest of the junk you find on those modern videophones, anyway.
</p>
<p>
Among the mysteries of Messenger is who exactly made it. The creators are Abeto, who "craft interactive realtime experiences", and have <a href="https://abeto.co/">a picturesque, tastefully information-free website</a> where you can wave away the petals that fall from a perpetually unfurling flower. Please don't let this be a front for a seedy cryptocurrency joint, or a terrible data-harvesting exercise of some kind. Please let it just be a nice game about roaming a pleasant spherical suburb.
