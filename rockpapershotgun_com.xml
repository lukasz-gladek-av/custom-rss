            <p>Covering announcement shows mean saving oneself for huge reveals, and since I might be the only person in the world right now this excited for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mekkablood-quarry-assault">Mekkablood: Quarry Assault</a>, I wondered if it might be better to hold off until a less pressing time. And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it's been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!</p>

<p>“They didn’t take my mech, and now they’re gonna take this two-tonne foot, straight up their corporate bums!” boasts the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duke-nukem">Duke Nukem</a> soundalike in the trailer. At least, I assume it’s ‘bums’. It’s bleeped out. It might be something more wholesome. Or something much, much worse. Either way, I’m down. That’s all the motivation I need these days.</p>
<p>Here’s what the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3056270/Mekkablood_Quarry_Assault/"> Steam page</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Year is 2082. You play the role of Bill, a grizzled, and extremely hairy robojockey. It's up to you to take the reigns of Bill's Mekk, with your friend Rusty, to get your revenge against TorxCorp, who's trying to steal your mining claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some features. Just the absolute best features. Love them.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mekk Combat</strong></p>
<p>Relive the glory days of the good old days with this first-person mech take on the classic Boomer Shooter gameplay. The in-cockpit view gives the retro 16-bit FPS feel a whole new twist.</p>
<p><strong>A Dance of Metal</strong></p>
<p>Moving around in your sluggish Mekk feels surprisingly smooth, Bill has truly mastered the giant robot’s controls like no other. And his weapons pack a punch! Make Swiss cheese of the enemies with bullets from afar or get up-close and personal with your dual saws.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Bill is a grizzled, and extremely hairy middle-aged man who doesn’t take shit from anyone. Torxcorp is going to get a 2-ton foot, straight up their ass for trying to take what is his.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets</strong></p>
<p>Discover secret areas in each level to find back your limited edition dash figurines. Spruce up your cockpit and watch them shake &amp; sway along with the action.</p></blockquote><p>


Mekkablood: Quarry Assault is "coming soon". Sucks for you, literally every other videogame.

            <p>Ah, it feels just like yesterday when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-still-has-around-a-year-of-development-left-likely-coming-in-2025">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> had<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-still-has-around-a-year-of-development-left-likely-coming-in-2025"> around a year of development time left</a>. Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.</p>

<p>As just revealed at the Percy Coswald Gamer show, the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> will be here next January, narrowed down from its previous ‘2025’ release date. There’s been a fair few sleeper-heads here at RPS, including Katharine (RPS in Peace), who couldn’t contain her excitement on learning <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">the sequel was real</a>.</p>
<p>Brendan spoke to Jump Over The Age’s Gareth Damian Martin recently, too, about a variety of subjects including the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-you-guess-which-australian-tv-sci-fi-of-the-early-2000s-inspired-citizen-sleeper-2">early 2000’s Australian TV sci-fi show that inspired it</a>. There’s also some fun crunchy design talk in there.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything," says Martin, "because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favourite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can currently grab the first Citizen Sleeper with a bunch of other games as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-grab-shadows-of-doubt-citizen-sleeper-and-more-in-jingle-jams-2024-bundle-and-support-eight-worthy-causes">Jingle Jam 2024</a> bundle.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>4X strategy and RPG stalwarts Shiro Games have announced SpaceCraft, a "massively multiplayer management and crafting adventure" set in Normandy during the Middle Ages, haha, of course not - it's set in space. They won't be winning the T.S. Eliot poetry prize with that title, but I guess it gets the job done. Here's a trailer.</p> <!--more-->

<p>And here's a little blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Explore the vast expanses of space in a custom-built starship. Gather vital resources from diverse planets throughout the universe to craft housing, production, communication, and other essential structures. Join forces with other players to form powerful trade organizations to take on challenging missions and shape a constantly evolving economy."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276050/SpaceCraft/">Steam page</a>, which digs a little into the detail of mechanics like faster-than-light travel, automation and fleet combat. The game's coming to early access in 2025.</p>
<p>Shiro are best known for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/northgard-review">"superb RTS"</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/northgard">Northgard</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-spice-wars-review">"compulsive 4X"</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-spice-wars">Dune: Spice Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wartales-review">"grimy medieval fantasy RPG</a>" Wartales, all games I would hesitantly summarise as "teetering on the edge of serious greatness". Breaking into MMO territory feels like a real gamble for them, but then again, when is making an MMO not a gamble?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tactical Mutant Ninja Turtles? Turn-based Mutant Ninja Tactics? I'm undecided, but its actual name is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, so maybe I should just call it that. It's just been announced and it's coming to PC next year.

<p>I'm extremely onboard with this for two reasons. One, it's a turn-based tactics game, and I always have a baseline of interest in them. Two, its battles apparently take just minutes to complete. It all looks a little bit Hoplite, at least in my head, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-hoplite">that was a truly wonderful turn-based roguelike</a> with similarly bite-sized skirmishes. In Tactical Takedown, the missions are strung together in mini-campaigns, each one focused on a different Turtle with their own unique abilities.
</p>
<p>I suppose the third reason I'm intrigued is that I was mad into Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, as the cartoon was called in the UK, when I was a kid. I had the figurines where their half-shells could open up and you could store their ninja stars (hero stars?) inside. Also that animated film last year, Mutant Mayhem, was pretty great.
</p><p>There have been a bunch of Turtles games recently, including the revival of the beat 'em ups with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a>, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, a sorta action RPG roguelike that came out last month, which I have installed but not yet played.
</p>
<p>Here's a fourth and final reason you might be interested in Tactical Takedown: it's being developed by Strange Scaffold, the folks behind recent indine hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a>. It's an unexpected matchup, and for now there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">more screenshots on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
