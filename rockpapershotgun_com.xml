            <p>Back in the mid '90s, I was hooked on an PC racing game called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/screamer">Screamer</a>. It got a sequel a couple of years later, and then the series went dormant. Until now, when it's seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You'll find a trailer below.

<p>I guess <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-kidding-around-i-just-want-another-screamer">Ed will be happy?</a>
</p>
<p>The trailer doesn't show anything in-game, and there's very little information about the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">on its official site</a>. I only knew it was connected to the '90s original by the logo for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone_(Italian_company)">Milestone Games</a> at the start of the trailer. They're the Italian game developer who created the first two games (the first under the name Graffiti), and are more recently known for (the better than expected) racing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hot-wheels-unleashed">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> and its sequel.
</p><p>Did the first Screamer have any kind of plot or framing device? If it did, I've long forgotten it. I remember it having great, Ridge Racer-style car control, and I remember my brothers and I becoming extremely competitive about trying to beat each other's times. I also remember the rally-oriented sequel being less good.
</p>
<p>I don't hate that the new Screamer seemingly moves in a new direction. It's been a long time, and there was nothing about the original duology that feels essential today. You can these days grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/697580/Screamer/">Screamer 1</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698620/Screamer_2/">Screamer 2</a> from Steam, although you're better off just watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er9ecGTA7lw&amp;ab_channel=Squakenet">a few minutes of the original on YouTube</a>.

Fumito Ueda is the august visionary behind ICO (small boy rescues small girl from evil castle), Shadow Of The Colossus (grieving boy murders several massive stone animals), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/last-guardian">The Last Guardian</a> (small boy and huge, dopey dogcat escape from another evil castle). Now, he's getting into Gundams, though it looks like small boys are still a feature. Epic Games Publishing have just unveiled Ueda and genDESIGN's latest creation - Project: Robot. Find a trailer below.

<p>
To recap that footage: it looks like the boy has set the giant robot to self-destruct, hence the garbled countdown, in order to defeat that tsunami of evil black goop. Then he flies away in the robot's head - a sequence that reminds me of the anime Gurren Lagann. Look, I'm struggling to phrase this elegantly and draw proper conclusions because I'm very tired. It's 3am here. You're not supposed to write about Fumito Ueda games at 3am - they tend to require a bit more thought, dare I say, a touch of reverie, rather than the frenzy of the Game Awards.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to say beyond the trailer, though you'll notice it has a bunch of text at the end in a tauntingly narrow, borderline unreadable font. It could be just the credits, but perhaps there's a synopsis hidden away in there. When I can see straight I'll have a go at deciphering it.
</p><p>
All weariness and snarking aside, I love Fumito Ueda's stuff and it's good to see that he and his colleagues are still churning out wacky originals. A less committed soul would have made Ico 2: Iconic by now. Project Robot seems closest in style to The Last Guardian, given that you are a small thing riding a larger thing. I am predictably concerned that the game will make me form an emotional bond with the giant robot, then destroy it in some heart-breakingly tragic way. Mind you, we did just see the robot get decapitated. So perhaps it's more of a tool than a friend.
</p>
<p>
Release date? None yet. More as we get it. Speculations welcome.

            <p>Well here's one I didn't see coming: a new Onimusha game. It's called Onimusha Way Of The Sword, and is the first new game in Capcom's samurai action-horror series since... well, that upcoming VR entry doesn't count, and nor does the Warlords remaster in 2018. So, 2012? Maybe 2006, if you rule out the Unity browser game? Cor.</p><!--more-->

<p>On the off-chance that you've never played an Onimusha game, and possibly weren't alive back in 2006, it's basically <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> but with a samurai and set in Japan. That was true of the first one, anyway. Later instalments took... interesting liberties. Onimusha 3 had Jean Reno in it for some reason. One thing they all share is more of a combat focus than the Resis. You don't need to find ammo for a katana, after all. But they certainly aren't hack-and-slash games.</p>
<p>The Way Of The Sword trailer doesn't reveal much, but it suggests a back-to-basics approach, as you might expect from a series that hasn't had a mainline instalment in almost two decades. It appears to be set in feudal times, and a bunch of demons are causing a ruckus in the woods. There are scenes of swordplay, including a few vicious finishers and some dramatic parrying. If it's cleaving close to formula, there should be RPG elements as well.</p>
<p>It's out in 2026. Any old Onimusha players in the haus? I think I fell off the series around about the time Jean Reno showed up.</p>
