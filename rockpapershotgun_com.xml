            <p>
Microsoft have published a memo recently sent to staff by CEO Sayta Nadella, which addresses the strange fact of Microsoft reporting net income in the ultrabillions while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laying off thousands of supposedly "treasured colleagues"</a>. Most of the blog is a gusty, jargony paean to generative AI technology, in which Microsoft have made vast investments, and how it is going to "empower everyone to create their own tools" and create a "local surplus" of Ability To Do Stuff in Microsoft dominions worldwide.
</p>

<p>

Nothing in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">blog</a> directly addresses what Nadella characterises as the "seeming incongruence" of Microsoft being richer than all of the Roman emperors combined, and still taking a blowtorch to video game studios like ZeniMax Online Studios, King, Rare and Sledgehammer Games. But I guess it's nice that they've recognised that the optics are weird.
</p>
<p>
"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella writes. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.
</p>
<p>
"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he continues. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding."
</p>
<p>
Ah, whomst amongst us can fathom the dissonant enigma of trillion dollar corporations spontaneously having layoffs happen to them, while doleful executives float by on golden balloons, scratching their heads with bloody hacksaws. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sources-suggest-that-staff-laid-off-at-king-will-be-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-helped-to-create">reportedly</a> been replacing developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> with the generative AIs they helped to "train". Satya Nadella is apparently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-surprising-way-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-uses-ai-to-consume-podcasts-on-his-commute/">a religious genAI user</a>, and I do wonder whether that's a "local surplus" of capacity that could justify some further cost-cutting, as per the glorious mysteries of progress.

            <p>Whimsy, grimdark, <em>and</em> gambling? And a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> to boot?! In <em>my</em> 2025 indie game? Eh, go on then. It looks neat. The trailer below features a desolate, hellish area called "The Pläins öf Päin" (umlauts mine) inhabited by lone egg idiot named 'eggo'. A curse on the egg idiot and his cracked shell, and a curse on the world for allowing this kind of tomfoolery to proliferate unchallenged.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slots-and-daggers">Slots &amp; Daggers</a> is by Friedemann, whose previous game was the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-teeny-tiny-townbuilder-is-the-pint-sized-townscaper-ive-been-waiting-for">Katharine-approved</a> tiny townbuilder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/summerhouse">Summerhouse</a>. "After my last game, I wanted to make something radically different," says Friedemann. "Something faster, with numbers, fights and goblins!". Angry caffeinated math goblins, you say? Here are some other features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3631290/Slots__Daggers">from Steam</a>.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fun slot machine</li>
<li>Weird fantasy world</li>
<li>Crude drawings of strange little guys</li>
<li>Retro visuals</li>
<li>Crunchy hip hop drum machines</li>
<li>Addictive arcade gameplay that goes “pling” a lot</li>
<li>Numbers! Fights! Goblins!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"To make this game I combined a lot of things I deeply love – weird fantasy worlds, crude drawings of strange little guys, old school crunchy hiphop drum machines and addictive arcade games that go “PLING PLING PLING” as they spit out little coins – with classic roguelike mechanics," says Friedemann. They also warn that this is a solo project, and as such "doesn’t offer 80+ hours of content like games developed by bigger teams."</p>
<p>As delighted by both the crunchy drum machines and chucklesome weirdos as I am, I do despair a bit that anyone feels the need to avert potential gamer rage by clarifying that their project doesn't last as long as a CRPG. This isn't a slight on the developer, of course. Going by a sample of one (me), literally everyone who has ever played a videogame before is a massive idiot, and you can't be too careful. Can't wait for the enraged Steam review at exactly 79 hours of playtime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gamings-only-three-genres-have-inevitably-converged-into-grimdark-balatro-with-a-whimsical-egg-idiot]]></content:encoded>
