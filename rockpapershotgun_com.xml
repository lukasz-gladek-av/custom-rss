            <p>
The original 256GB LCD version of Valve's Steam Deck is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/">20% off till 1st December</a>, knocking it down to around $319.20 or £279.20 in the UK. It's all part of this year's Blackening of Friday, whereby whimpering price tags are shoved partway into sausage machines for the benefit of the first Xmas shoppers. 
</p>
<p>
"That's a chunk of cheddar," whistled our new editorial director Julian, a choice of words I choose to take literally, mostly because he's just ruined my sausage machine analogy. According to the UK's Office of National Statistics, cheddar was 873p a kilogram as of January 2025, the last recorded figure. Assuming that average holds true, the Steam Deck is currently worth 32 kilograms of classic farmhouse cheese. That <em>is</em> a chunk of cheddar. Good work, Julian! This is why they handed you the big boss trousers.

<p>
I'm vegan, so I'm totally unswayed by all these dairy-based overtures, but even if I were one of you lactose junkies, I still wouldn't get a Steam Deck at 20% off. James loaned me one of his a year or so ago, and I was quite impressed by its ability to let me play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> lying down, but my PC gaming is half-and-half MK and controller. I already own a Switch, which has maybe a third of the best PC action-platformers on it already, and I've found that Steam Deck sucks for quintessentially desktop genres like real-time strategy. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible that this is a misapprehension born of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">lingering, amorous hatred for Mech Engineer's demo</a>, and that I'm missing out on a golden age of tightly optimised controller-native harvester raids and flanking actions. I look forward to your outraged comments in defence of portable Starcraft.</p><p>Yes, I know I can get a wireless mouse and keyboard, but if I'm going to round the thing out with accessories, why not just splurge on a basic gaming laptop with a better screen that can be used for a bunch of other things? Yes, I know you can output to your TV, but I've banished my TV to a wardrobe because the power "button" broke, and I've lost the remote. Hello, TV manufacturers! Please can you put proper fucking buttons on TVs again. A single, brittle plastic tab hidden inside the frame is not adequate for my needs.  
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope you'll join me in firmly rejecting Valve's cut-price Steam Deck. Think of all the cheddar you'll be able to buy with the cash you've saved, you stinky whey-fancier. Alternatively, you could put your cheese money towards the purchase of a Steam Deck OLED - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">I hear they're decent</a> - or one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve's many forthcoming new gizmos</a>.</p>
<p>If you do insist on buying an original Steam Deck, I recommend reading James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck academy hub</a> (as advertised in the header), which encompasses how-to guides, accessory roundups, and game-specific performance and settings overviews. Perhaps if enough of you read that piece, James will feel magnaminous and lend me one of his again, so that I can finish being angry and frustrated at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>.
