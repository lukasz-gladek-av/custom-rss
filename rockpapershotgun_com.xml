            <p>There are two blue wolves inside you. One is actually a hedgehog, prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. The other one is actually a dolphin, who is also prone to loop-the-loops and drowning in caves. Clarification: when I said you I meant me. I’m referring to my own squalid psychological architecture as a Sega Mega Drive player with vivid memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> (especially the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">Star Light Zone</a>) and Ecco the Dolphin. </p>
<p>While Sega’s pugnacious pinball mascot continues to star in videogames of all flavours, poor Ecco has been absent from screens since the early noughties. No longer: this year shall be the year of Ecco. Developers A&amp;R Atelier – whose members include the character’s original creator, Ed Annunziata – have <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/THE-WORLD-NEEDS-ECCO-THE-DOLPHIN">declared</a> that they are working on “several” new Ecco things, including a videogame. No, I won’t accommodate any criticism of my framing here. If we can have a year of Luigi and a year of Shadow, we can have a year of Ecco.</p><!--more-->
<p>New to Ecco? The original Mega Drive/Genesis games were 2D action-adventures in which you swam around beautiful pixel grottos, surfacing periodically for air and singing at other sea creatures and alien crystals. Wonderful, dreamy, frightening exercises in exploration and puzzling with a splash of ram-the-shark combat. The overarching storyline involves time travel and saving the planet. I have never played a swimming game with quite this ambience.</p>
<p>"It has been years in the making and we're honored to bring Ecco back," said Ed Annunziata, Chief Creative Officer of A&amp;R Atelier. "Ecco has always been more than a game about a dolphin - he's a bridge between worlds." Oh god, please let that be a reference to the aforesaid storyline and not a hint about some Netflix transmedia merchandising op. In general: please let A&amp;R Atelier not be some kind of shady cash-in operation. I've never heard of them before and they <a href="https://www.anratelier.com/">don't have a proper website</a>, at the time of writing.</p><p>We do already have some concrete indications of what those new Ecco projects are, concrete enough that the elusiveness of this week's announcement feels slightly weird. In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">an Xbox Wire post from May last year</a>, Annunziata revealed that "me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities." I also notice that the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">Ecco the Dolphin site</a> has a countdown on it, with approximately 2329 hours or 100 days to go.</p>
<p>While Ecco hasn’t attracted quite the same glut of fangames as Sonic, there are some <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/threads/ecco-the-dolphin-reverse-engineering-and-preservation-project.39893/">preservation projects</a> in the wilds, and <a href="https://itch.io/search?q=ecco+the+dolphin">a few Ecco homages on Itch.io</a>. Annunziata has himself hosted an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ecco-jam-0-tickets-1782288836889?aff=oddtdtcreator">Ecco gamejam</a>, though it was a private affair. If I were rebooting Ecco today, I would definitely be aiming to team up with some fangamers akin to the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>. Also, the new one had better not be 3D, you savages. We already have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> at home.</p>

            <p>You might be aware of the great Disco thrupening, or quadrupening depending on how you classify things. Over the past couple of years, a number of new studios have loudly hoovered up various ex-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> devs following internal conflict at ZA/UM, and announced games that aim to rebottle the RPG's lightning. One such studio is Londgue, who recently told me their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">partially-crowdfunded RPG</a> called Hopetown now has a playable intro, despite quietly switching narrative leads last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hopetown-disco-elysium-shadow-interview">interviewed two of Hopetown's key developers</a> in April last year, around the time Longdue launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown">Kickstarter campaign</a> to provide "a small percentage of the total budget" for the game. The campaign's since more than doubled its original £25,000 goal, amassing £117,924 from just over 2,700 backers. Development is now underway, but the narrative lead I interviewed, Grant Roberts, is no longer at Longdue. Roberts' <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantroberts/">LinkedIn profile</a> indicates he left the studio in July 2025, just three months after the Kickstarter's launch.</p>
<p>The former Rocksteady and Bungie writer's departure from a project his LinkedIn profile cites him as having "defined, refined, and evangelised the vision for" appears to have happened pretty quietly - so quietly that, as of writing, he's still listed in the team section of <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/">Hopetown's website</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair, former ZA/UM developer Martin Luiga was acknowledged as Hopetown's narrative lead in a <a href="https://www.hopetowngame.com/post/hopetown-developer-interview-martin-luiga">short developer update</a> posted by Longdue last August, though that update doesn't mention him having taken over from Roberts. I recently reached out to both Roberts and Longdue about this. The latter responded with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>We decided to part ways with Grant Roberts - who was narrative lead - after Martin Luiga (former co-founder of ZAUM and writer on Disco Elysium) scaled up his work with Longdue, and took over the role of narrative and creative lead after re-designing the skills system of the game.</blockquote>
<p>The studio also provided a quote from Luiga outlining how Hopetown's development is going as of January 2026. "We've re-designed and extensively tested a new skills system, based on my learnings from the early days of writing on Disco Elysium," the developer said. "We've also made incredible progress on the world, characters, and plot and have defined the opening scene of the game itself that is now in playable form, with variations of the introductory sequence written by myself and our writing team."</p><p>Longdue have been posting monthly short developer updates with different members of Hopetown's current team since that one with Luiga last August, so here's hoping on behalf of any folks who've backed the Kickstarter that a proper look at all of this apparent progress is released as part of those soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, original Disco studio ZA/UM continue to plow ahead with their own Disco follow-up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">Zero Parades</a>. Dark Math Games and Summer Eternal - two studios which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">IGN</a> reported in 2024 are or have been linked to each other and Longdue in various messy ways which occasionally beggar belief - are also working on their own Discoey things. For Dark Math, that's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">ski resort murder mystery game</a> called Tangerine Antarctic. For Summer Eternal, it's a mysterious game codenamed Red Rooster, which they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">announced by way of a book</a>. Finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are reportedly working on their own game at another studio named Red Info, and have remained relatively quiet compared to ZA/UM and the thruple of studios I've just mentioned thus far.</p>
<p>I personally remain rather sceptical of any of these shots to the Disco chaser, something which extends to ZA/UM's in-house attempt to re-ignite the magic following what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">certainly sounds like a horrible few years</a> to have been a dev on the original.</p>

            <p>We'll heave him up an away we'll go. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! We'll heave him up an away we'll go. We're all bound over to Ubisoft's official music YouTube channel! We'll heave him up from down below. 'Way, me Assassin's Creeda! Oh, this is where a bunch of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties have just been reuploaded, potentially providing yet another hint that we're all soon bound to be playing that long-rumoured remake of the pirassassin adventure!</p>
<p>This sudden influx of classic ditties might not have meant much in a vacuum, but it follows many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that's about as close as you can get to a seal of approval short of Ubisoft finally giving up the ghost anmd revealing the thing themselves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you fancy filling your brain with these pervasive earworms from the Age of Exploration once again, the fact 18 of them have been reuploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic">Ubisoft's music channel</a> within the past 24 hours makes doing so easy. These cuts of tunes ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vkoDWgLAQ">Way Me Susianah</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syW8yEW1HRE">Billy Riley</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xgr3Ne6hNk">We Be Three Poor Mariners</a> appear to be the same ones originally released in the sea shanty compilation album released around the time of Black Flag's original 2014 release.</p>
<p>Their appearance on this Ubisoft channel doesn't just appear to be part of a regular cycle of randomly reuploading older material either - the other recent soundtrack excerpts uploaded there have all been timed up to mirror the release of new stuff by the publishers. For example, a lot of the most recent tunes prior to this Black flag deluge are from December's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirages-allegedly-saudi-backed-dlc-valley-of-memory-releases-november-18">Valley of Memory expansion</a> from November.</p><p>So, while my personal favourite Black Flag sailing song The Worst Old Ship sadly isn't among these reuploaded shanties, they certainly look like another in the litany of Remake signs that even any vessels whose lookout desperately needs new spectacles have spotted by now.</p>
<p>Relatively recent reporting's alleged that said Remake, or Resync if the PEGI rathing has is name correct, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to arrive in March</a>. So, these tunes may be intended as something to help folks pass time while waiting out the last couple of months patrolling a deserted dock.</p>
