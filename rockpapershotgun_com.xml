            <p>
Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> creators 11-bit studios have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-howl">Death Howl</a>, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 
</p>
<p>
You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

"Each realm visited offers unique deck types and mechanics, enriching and deepening the strategic layer," howls the press release. "Players can further enhance their decks with shamanic totems, ensuring they are best prepared for the deadly encounters ahead." What's more, "each region not only unlocks aforementioned new cards to craft, but also unveils fragments of Ro's story, steeped in themes of love and loss, and uncovers the forgotten lore of this mysterious spiritual world."
</p><p>
I quite like the game's stark, emaciated, slightly rotten pixelart. It looks like somebody's taken a chisel to a seam of obsidian and discovered a layer of organic matter beneath - pinkish bones, greening flesh. The cards are pleasingly grisly. "Take Skin", for example. Eesh! There's another one with a drawing of an arrow going through somebody's leg - hopefully the owner of that leg survived and is now living out a prosperous second career as a guard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm less sold on the game's self-serious narrative direction, which make me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> at its shoutiest. "The loss of a loved one is universal - an inevitable part of the human experience," howls director, artist and writer Malte Burup in the press release. "We believe our narrative approach, enriched by compelling lore and a fresh take on the deck-builder genre through its fusion with soulslike exploration, will resonate with players of all kinds." 
</p>
<p>
I'm always up for a good Universal Theme, but foregrounding your takeaways so baldly feels false, and a certain amount of clunky melodrama seems inevitable when your tale of woe is literally called Death <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>. The talk of wrestling with one's mortality sits a little uneasily alongside the paint-by-numbers Steam tag spectacle that is "open world soulslike deckbuilder". I wonder if I'm going to end up feeling about this game the same way Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gris-review">felt about Gris</a> and its massive, sobbing statues. 
</p>
<p>Still, all that could be more of a marketing problem than an issue with the game - and it's clearly "resonating" with me to some extent, or I wouldn't be writing this. Death Howl is out later in 2025, and there's a demo coming to Steam on Monday 20th January.

            <p>Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war">God Of War</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">a report</a> by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a> remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The natural worry here is that the decision will lead to layoffs. Sony confirmed the cancellations, saying they took place after an internal "review". However they wouldn't commit to an answer about employee job security, saying only that they didn't intend to close the studios. Meanwhile, a memo was sent in an effort to reassure staff, letting them know PlayStation would try to "ensure there is minimal business impact". The company would be working with the studios to figure out what they'll be working on next, PlayStation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfrztbks25">told Bloomberg</a>. </p>
<p>"Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family," they said in a statement to Bloomberg, "and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects."</p>
<p>Ominous. We didn't hear much talk about the God Of War game before now. But we knew something was afoot at Bend when they began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">hiring for staff with experience making blockbuster live service games</a>. Even at the time it seemed unusual for this single player studio to pivot to live service, but this is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">general trend chased by Sony</a> since 2022, albeit one they seem to be abandoning of late. The company have cancelled a few other live service projects in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-cancel-the-last-of-us-online-while-teasing-new-single-player-projects">a multiplayer game based on The Last Of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-leaked-spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-shows-off-insomniacs-cancelled-co-op-spin-off">a co-op Spiderman</a> game. </p><p>Cancellations are fairly common in the industry, so arguably this is not that unusual. But it does look like the fear has truly been injected into Sony by hydraulic needle following the fate of online hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, a flop estimated to have cost the company at least $200 million, with the real cost likely being higher than that. That includes the human cost of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">all the workers who lost their jobs</a> when the studio was shuttered as a result.</p>
<p>Live service is an interesting monster in the grander ecosystem of videos gamesing. Huge corporations are attracted to the model thanks to certain heavy hitters like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> retaining a magical dollar-shitting ability for years and years and years. But they can be massively attention-demanding for the average player - how many of this type of game can you really play on the reg? My feelings about games-as-a-service is broadly in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">Edwin's recent eloquent scribblethoughts</a>. Here's a good part of that: </p>
<blockquote>Even before they became ubiquitous, live service games felt like a burden. They are inherently exhausting to think about. The business model is the experience in a way that it isn't for anything you "buy once" and theoretically enjoy in your "own time", away from the sludgepumps of commerce - it breaks the golden rule that art created under capitalism should at least feel like it's an escape from capitalism, by forcing you to think of playing as an on-going interaction with an evolving product.</blockquote>

            <p>Superheroes often conceal their identities behind masks, capes and in my case, a pungent snood-and-hoodtop combo that makes me look like I've crawled out of a drain. No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out <em>some</em> of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play. </p><!--more-->
<p>Well, get ready to be unmasked, you awful sneaks, because developers NetEase are planning to crack down on this duplicitous practice. If they catch you faking a pair of analogue sticks, they might even suspend your account.</p>
<p>"We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse," explains <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html">a post on the game's forums</a>. "This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features. Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter."</p>
<p>Perhaps you think you can slip the strong grasp of Justice by means of ratlike cunning. Fool! Ratlike cunning is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Tomalin">the exclusive preserve of journalists</a>. And besides, NetEase "have forged a strong detection tool" which they will "couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters."</p><p>I know that it's written in character, but I'm slightly alarmed that NetEase feel it necessary to specify that their eyes are human. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Perhaps everybody in the office is an Ultron clone, and banning mouse and keyboard adaptors is all part of some globe-toppling Master Plan.</p>
<p>Even if it is, I can't argue with the point that tricksy M&amp;K bolt-ons give some users an unsporting edge. "We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players," the NetEase post continues. "Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to be very popular. And chaotic, given that the entire cast are superheroes. This is a game in which everybody needs to feel like they could dominate. I don't envy the devs trying to distinguish the superpowered from the overpowered, let alone flush out the cheaters. If you missed it earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">they're planning to add two new characters a season</a>, so the balancing is only going to get more complicated from here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
