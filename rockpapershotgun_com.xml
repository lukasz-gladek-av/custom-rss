            <p>Microsoft are telling the world that the sooner we all switch to using generative AI tools in our day-to-day lives, the sooner we will 10x ourselves. Yet the corporation are still only finding haphazard pick up by videogame developers, including some of their own studios.</p>
<p>As executive producer Susan Kath tells me, the Elder Scrolls Online team haven't yet found a part of development where they can use it. "Right now, we generally use it for things like this," Kath says, indicating our call. "A lot of us get a lot of use out of Copilot, for meetings, for summaries, inbox organisations, stuff like that."</p>
<p>But, in the case of art, coding, or writing, generative AI is not something the team are using in Elder Scrolls Online's development, and its adoption is still an open discussion within the studio. "I don't know what our decision is going to be, because we're still having conversations about where we go with that," Kath says. "Obviously we all have strong opinions within the studio. Obviously Microsoft has invested heavily in this. That would be a thing that I would imagine we would talk about in the future."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I asked for more detail, wanting to know the contentions of that discussion. Was the slow adoption because of objections on moral or ethical grounds, because the technology wasn't capable of doing the work well enough, or because the bits of the job generative AI is meant to replace are the parts of the job developers enjoy doing?</p><p>"Can the answer be all of the above?" Kath laughs. "It may be useful right now. There are areas where [AI]'s probably really good at doing things that we don't necessarily want to use it for, for whatever reasons. In the cases where it does work for us, we will explore using that. I don't know that I could go deeper. It's hard, because we're talking about something where I'm like 'We don't [use it] right now, because the areas where we would anticipate that it would be useful, potentially it might not be where we need it to be yet'."</p>
<p>In the spirit of openness, I'm having a similar discussion with the RPS team. For instance, I used an AI tool to create a rough transcription of this interview before cleaning it up manually in a separate tool. But this isn't something everyone on the team would do, with some choosing not to use any generative AI transcription tools. We're still establishing a line on whether these tools can benefit us and if we should use any of them if they could help our work. Let alone which tools would take away the parts of the job we actually enjoy doing.</p>
<p>The above doesn't even address how using AI tools impacts our relationship with you, the reader. One of the worst things I could do as RPS's editor would be to publish an article written by AI. You come to this site to read our work, not something that we couldn't be bothered to write ourselves.</p>
<p>I say all this to Kath, ending with how it's complex to navigate, she agrees. "For example, it's incredibly useful to do research with, but also I really like doing research – I'm sure that you have encountered the same. It's absolutely useful to ask 'Go do a bunch of research for me'. But ultimately, that's also one of the really fun parts of what I do from time to time."</p>
<p>So, in short, another day, another couple of people stumbling through the increasingly machine world we live in.</p>
<p>I want to flag that this was a rushed discussion at the end of an interview, so we only spoke briefly on the subject. I was more intent to learn about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">the impact of last year's layoffs on the studio</a> and to clarify aspects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-yearly-expansions-and-folding-its-premium-content-into-the-base-game-but-its-also-gaining-a-battle-pass">the recent move to Season updates instead of big Chapter expansions</a>, confirming, for instance, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-seasons-will-add-new-zones-but-itll-be-a-different-flavour">we would still see new zones added to the game</a>.</p><p>However, I do think it's an important discussion to have, especially in light of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">Larian's recent open discussion of the technology</a> and where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">they found generative AI's limits prevented it from being useful</a>. After all, Microsoft are one of the biggest backers of generative AI. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid the technolgy's tendrils, in part because companies like Microsoft are insistent that we use it, if only to justify their investment. If the corporation's own developers are struggling to find the benefits of the technology, or questioning whether they should adopt it, then why shouldn't we?</p>

            <p>As the price of RAM, GPUs, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">even SSDs</a> climbs ever higher off the back of AI data centre demand, it's causing a significant price crunch for hardware manufacturers. "It is such a volatile situation at this point in time it is hard to figure out pricing," Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview">a recent episode of The Verge's Decoder podcast</a>. "I don't know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you and [be confident in it] by the end of the podcast."</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing prices mean the company are keeping schtum on how much their next round of gaming laptops will cost. "This is something that concerns me," Tan explained. "The RAM prices are going up and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and in the reach of gamers out there."</p>
<p>But it wasn't all doom and gloom during the CES podcast recording.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When asked if component prices could hit a level that would force Razer out of the gaming laptop business, Tan said he hoped it wouldn't come to that. "We've seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past – spikes in pricing. As long as manufacturing kicks in, and we're able to keep up, it's just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing, we believe that it will come down. What goes up must come down and what goes down goes up too."</p>
<p>So, if you can, even Razer CEO seems to be advising holding off on buying that new gaming laptop for now.</p>
<p>Not that Razer showed off any new gaming laptops at CES this month. Instead, they announced Project Motoko, a pair of camera-fitted, AI-powered headphones that creepily analyse your surroundings as you go about your life, and Project Ava, a holographic AI companion who lives in a tube on your desk and tells you you're looking great, like a sycophantic Zordon – one for the Power Rangers fans out there. All of which was par for the course, when it comes to this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">AI-seduced trade show</a>.</p>

<p>Razer are far from alone in feeling the pinch of rising component costs. We have seen significant price jumps in components since Valve revealed the Steam Machine last November. As James found, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">even trying to make an estimate of how much Valve's living room PC could cost is a headache</a>. The mini PC is due for release in early 2026, but there is still no hint of a price – only that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-confirm-the-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-with-similar-specs-rather-than-a-console">Valve won't be eating any of the cost, as console manufacturers do</a>.</p><p>And it's not only hardware makers that are feeling the pinch. The shortages are impacting game developers, too, with Larian revealing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genai-users-larian-forced-to-build-divinity-around-ram-shortage-caused-by-genai">they're optimising the early access release of Divinity to account for lower-end PCs</a>. Traditionally, they would make these optimisations later in the game's development.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must buy a new graphics card, though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-in-2026s-component-hellscape-amds-radeon-rx-9070-xt-is-that-rarest-of-things-a-high-end-gpu-thats-still-decent-value">James was impressed by AMD Radeon's  RX 9070 XT</a>. While the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is better at ray tracing, the two GPUs otherwise perform pretty much evenly, despite the $720 Radeon being significantly cheaper than its $900 GeForce rival. Still, maybe hold off a tad longer if you can.</p>
