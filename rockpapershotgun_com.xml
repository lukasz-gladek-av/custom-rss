            <p>Nordic stealth game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream">Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</a> crept out from behind some barrels during last night's Future Games Show and hit audiences over the back of the head with a release date. Some of the developers also showed up to share their enthusiasm for the game's lighting effects, which to be fair are quite nice.</p>

<p>It's coming out July 15th, pretty soon. If you're not familiar, Eriksholm is set in an alternate universe 1900s in a Scandinavian country filled with pretty props and rustic posters. It's very good-looking, very story-heavy, and having played a short preview of the opening hours, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-city-of-eriksholm-looks-captivating-but-i-wish-itd-sneak-in-some-new-ideas">so far unsurprising</a>. At least when compared to other stealth games. </p>
<p>"Observe guard behaviors, use environmental cues, and find clever solutions to overcome obstacles," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">the Steam page</a>. "Scout environments carefully, use cover and stealth, and employ diversion tactics to evade detection." Sounds like a stealth game alright! There is a "puzzle" element to figuring out the routes around guards, we're told, and that'll maybe become a little more intriguing once all the characters come into play - each with their own ability. Although those abilities are bread and butter stealth tools: blowdart someone to sleep, throw a distracting pebble, or strangle someone from behind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">summer of eternal Geoffs</a> burns ever on. Edwin is out in Los Angeles right now, about to get obliterated by Microsoft announcements during the Xbox showcase. You lot keep reading, and we'll keep writing. Actually, we'll keep writing even if you stop reading. We don't know any other way to live. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The rats have escaped, and one of them is clutching a fifteen second teaser trailer for a new Plague Tale game from Focus. The teaser briefly squeaked its way to the sunlight on Focus's Threads account before being swiftly shooed back into its hole, but the rapscallions over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1l5sfjf/a_plague_tale_spinoff_probably_leaked/">gaming leaks and rumours subreddit</a> grabbed the details. Of course, we don't say rapscallions here. We say rapspringonions. Here's the trailer, via our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-resonance-plague-tale-legacy-accidentally-leaks-online">great mates Eurogamer</a>.</p>

<p>As I say, there's not a great deal to go on here. We see fighting, boating, what looks like a Roman colosseum, and a shadowy minotaur. I didn't play much of the second game, though I did enjoy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, so I'm a bit behind on the rat lore. Reddit has some theories, though. A character named Basilius from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a> was responsible, in ancient Roman times, for unleashing Focus's excellent rat tech on the world. So this looks to be a prequel of sorts.</p>
<p>The teaser ends with number '2026', potentially a devious ARG cypher leading to a series of guerrilla marketing posters in bus stops all over Cambridge, each containing a single letter of the sentence "the game is out next year". We'll have to see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
