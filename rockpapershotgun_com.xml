            <p>Amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring SSD prices</a>, slower-but-cheaper mechanical hard drives may have offered an attractive reprieve for anyone wanting to embiggen their PC storage on a – and I know it’s increasingly difficult to use this word without breaking down into desperate laugh-crying – budget. Unfortunately, that probably ain’t happening either, as leading HDD manufacturers Western Digital and Seagate have both revealed that they’ve already sold “pretty much” all of their mechanical drive stock that was allocated for 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by German tech site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WD-and-Seagate-confirm-Hard-drives-for-2026-sold-out-11178917.html">Heise</a>, the admissions (or boasts, depending how you look at it) came during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864150-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">WD</a> and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863159-seagate-technology-holdings-plc-stx-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seagate’s</a> respective earnings calls in January. WD CEO Tiang Yew Tan said that in addition to maxing out production for 2026, "robust commercial agreements" for 2027 and 2028 are already in place with major buyers, while Seagate’s CEO William Mosley claimed the company’s HDD output capacity is "fully allocated" through the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Naturally, the bulk-buying of these hard drives – which is already causing shortages and heighted prices for home PC users – is being performed by the same entities that are driving the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">SSD and RAM shortages</a>. Namely, big tech companies wanting to build and kit out enormous data centres from which to run their AI products, like those genAI tools that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game devs hate</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hooded-horse-ban-ai-generated-art-in-their-games-all-this-thing-has-done-is-made-our-lives-more-difficult">publishers are banning</a>. Cool! This industry-wide rush has, for months, been causing a DRAM chip shortage that’s managed to widely knacker PC component availability, gouge prices, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">delay Valve’s new Steam Machine</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">kill off Crucial</a>. Seems we can add hard drives to the list of casualties, a development that also spells more bad news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> prices. If mech drives aren’t available as a cheaper alternative, that’s yet more demand being piled on SSDs, which would inevitably make supplies even scarcer and ticket prices even heavier.</p>
<p>For now, at least, a quick canter through the Internet shops suggests that hard drive supplies haven’t yet dried up entirely, and they’re still cheaper than equivalent-capacity NVMe SSDs. Still, they are snared in the same pricing trap: this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Barracuda-internal-Drive-Modellnr/dp/B0BYT7BD4Y">1TB Seagate Barracuda</a> is £80 at the time of writing, but was £52 at the end of January, and £43 in December 2025. And with replacement stock having apparently been flogged to Microsoft and the like, don’t expect that to drift back down anytime soon.</p><p>I recently asked some specialist hardware manufacturers, as part of an upcoming feature, whether they’d advise PC upgrade seekers to take the money hit now or wait until things (hopefully) calm down in 2027. Responses were mostly mixed, but everyone agreed – as do I – that if you <em>can </em>keep going with your current components, SSD or HDD storage included, you probably should.</p>

            <p>
Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> was announced, we knocked it for offering zappy muzak in place of the TV show’s official theme. Gamexcite and Daedalic have added the theme, now, and I sort of wish they hadn’t. “Help!” I screeched to my bedroom walls, as the rousingly sorrowful opening bars wafted from the speakers like nitrous oxide. “A videogame is making me feel something! It is making me feel like 31 years have passed, and I can still remember Neelix getting drunk on water. I still remember the Doctor’s first words. I still remember blowing up the Caretaker Array rather than using it to insta-warp home.” 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can choose not to blow up the Caretaker Array in Across the Unknown, but I was too chickenshit to witness the consequences of leaving such a device in the hands of the bullying, bouffanted Kazon. That’s not what Janeway would have done, and while Across the Unknown’s Janeway has a certain demon Botox energy, she looks the part closely enough to command my loyalty. Let us go forth, Captain! There’s <em>coffee</em> out there in these nebulae.

<p>
We were a Star Trek/Buffy/Simpsons household back in the 90s, tuning in at 6pm sharp after school to get our fill of phasers, Spike and Moleman, save for those days when the Beeb would stiff us with an episode of Neighbors. While the spectacle of Voyager sliding over gas giant rings remains pristine in my mind, there are definitely a few bits I’ve forgotten. 
</p><p>
For example, I don’t remember Voyager spending this much time hurrying between planets to stock up on Deuterium for the warp engine. I don’t remember the crew losing faith in you if you fail to build a new storage room in time. These are the managerial intricacies they edit out of 30 minute TV episodes, but thanks to the magic of videogames, the one true artform, we are free to sigh in exasperation because we can no longer research a new transponder amplifier after running out of juice. Fortunately, power-outs don’t (so far) interfere with your ability to move around and gather resources.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t remember Tom Paris looking this avuncular. Whatever star fitfully smiled upon the conception of this game’s Janeway smirked in contempt when Daedalic gave flesh to nu-Paris. He’s so… sturdy! He still talks like the old Paris, though, which is to say, like a snarky little flyboy, and he’s fared better than Kes, who looks like she’s been dunked in custard. In general, the script approximately matches my memories of the old cast, though it’s a sparser creation with no voice-acting, carried along by dialogue choices that sort of usher you through old plotlines, while occasionally giving you the chance to deviate from canon. I haven’t done much deviating so far, unless you count sabotaging morale by failing to open a new locker room within 30 cycles.
</p>
<p>
Across the Unknown divides your labours as follows. Firstly, you click to scan and move Voyager around procedurally generated star systems, with time paused until you set a course. Secondly, you manage the ship’s interior, a cutaway dollhouse simulation akin to latter-day XCOM base management, with rooms and systems to clear and build according to a resource budget. Thirdly, you send people with different skillsets off on away missions that consist of a series of Choose Your Own Adventure challenges. Fourthly, you autobattle with 3D spaceships, giving Voyager orders that reflect the state of your shields, hull and critical systems, while performing crew special abilities with a cooldown.
</p>
<p>
After an hour mostly spent in the prologue, I wouldn’t call any of this mindblowing. It’s a bog-standard Holodeck recreation of bits of other games. It also makes me newly sad that we’ll never get to play the finished version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumplight-odyssey">Jumplight Odyssey</a>. Still, Across The Unknown doesn’t have any obvious major problems, as yet, and if your memories of the show are copious yet fading, the Proustian euphoria of recognising the specific arrangement of command chairs on the Voyager bridge may convince you to forgive the straightforward moving parts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across The Unknown</a> is out today on Steam. The demo's still live if you fancy it.

            <p>Rubbing shoulders with factions is a big part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> charm, even if it often devolves into you doing a bunch of favours if you don't want to risk ending up on the vilified naughty list for one too many accidental grenade pickpocktings. You do get some nice perks for keeping the likes of the NCR or Legion on side, but a new mod aims to take that to a new level, letting you send faction cronies out on handy odd jobs while you kick your feet up.</p>

<p>The mod's called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96429">U_DO_IT - Faction Quest Assigner</a>' and is the work of SkullzyRS, the creator of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3433">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2466">number</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4497">of</a> popular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> mods. They've recently turned their hands to New Vegas for a project I can't recall off the top of my head as having been done previously in Obsidian's radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.</p>
<p>"I love to roleplay and have always wanted to step into the shoes of NPC man and get someone to do the dirty work for me, so this is the beginning of that idea," the modder wrote in the description of their creation. "The goal would eventually be to get NPCs to actually be able to complete minor or trivial 'go there, get that, bring back' fetch quests for you while you focus on the real and exciting... fetch quests lol, but this is what I have for now as quest editing has been a notoriously bad area to play with in general, so baby steps at the moment."</p><p>In its current form, Faction Quest Assigner adds a command device to your inventory that you can use to send NPCs from eight different Mojave factions out on. These jobs are all done offscreen and range from the likes of patrolling and scavenging to sabotage and assassinations. Once you've picked a job, you pick one of four difficulty tiers to dictate how long the job'll take, what rewards you might net from it, and the percentage chance of your goons failing to complete it.</p>
<p>Naturally, the higher the risk, the higher the reward - often in caps or items, plus a dollop of positive rep with that faction. In order to limit the ability to cheese your way straight into the hearts of every group, these little missions come with a cooldown of three in-game days. Overall, I can certainly see it as the sort of mod I might use to help keep the latter stages of a New Vegas playthrough busy.
