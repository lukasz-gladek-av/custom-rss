            <p>One of my favourite things in the entire world is the brash poetry inherent in the word 'skyscraper', and the many writing and language lessons gleaned from considering how utterly mundane that word actually feels to use. This week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> community join me in the "probably thinking too much about skyscrapers" club. Paradox's city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> has turned ten.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/cities-skylines-anniversary">constructed a towering roadmap of freebies</a> for it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, including new radio stations, new content, and a free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665876198">Steam event</a> for the original running March 20-24.</p>

<p>Some<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/ten-years-of-cities-skylines"> blogly</a> musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build. With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much - and still has more to teach - and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cities: Skylines has continued to receive updates throughout the years, the most recent being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-latest-dlc-came-out-this-week-18-months-after-its-final-dlc-came-out-last-year">last October</a>. Its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">launched in a rough state</a> a year prior, though has seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">some improvements since</a>. It's also seen some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">controversy surrounding "rushed" DLC</a>, and still looks a ways off from overtaking the original in both popularity and reception.</p>
<p>Paradox have fessed up to misjudging the impact of Skylines 2's launch technical shortcomings. Players are now "less accepting that you will fix things over time," Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">told Edwin last year</a>, with CCO Henrik Fåhraeus commenting seperately that "we were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players." </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-nothing-beyond-this-point-except-a-promisingly-odd-metroidvania-about-exploring-the-void<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
One of my Foundational Video Games is <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/4498-mazeworld-the-ghost-of-mordaine">Mazeworld</a>, an elder Apple Macintosh first-personifier in which you explore a Carollian landscape of blue-walled darkness and rainbow-shelled snails. I was a young slip of a boy when Mazeworld released, and prone to daymares about crocodiles floating through the ceiling. Imagine my reaction to a game in which you are immediately confronted by a slathering, bodiless Cheshire Cat, its face a grinning smear that is only visible when it's charging right at you.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for games that similarly hide themselves, throwing you into a chasm of occult potentiality from which anything might emerge, given the appropriate rites. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a> and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nothing-beyond-this-point">Nothing Beyond This Point</a>, a topdown metroidvania in which you are a flaming cube surrounded by floating rods, dropped into a pixelart-scuffed void. RPS reader Mr_B recommended it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-324?view=comments">our last weekend plays thread</a>, and I couldn't resist trying the demo.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The aforesaid void isn't quite a blob of bad vibes, in practice. It has structure and the suggestion of an orderly grand design. There are 16 areas divided into tacit rooms, with reassuring fixtures such as campfires. There are genre-familiar activities such as having to clear a room of foes before you can leave it, or choosing between three permanent power-ups at key junctures.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of Enigma, however. Some rooms wrap around themselves and can only be exited from a certain side. Campfires aren't just "access points" and "save points", they're there to provide "a false sense of security". There are sigils that can eventually be interacted with in the form of a doodling minigame, altering the environment. There are also three gods to find, and the rudiments of coherent places. At one point a disembodied voice started talking to me in garbled Cthulhu language, alluding to a distant obelisk. 
</p>
<p>
The combat is also quite ingenious so far. Basically, you're immortal as long as you're surrounded by floating rods, which dissolve when you take damage and can be regenerated by holding space - which locks you in place for a fateful second or two. Rods are also spent to perform special abilities such as fireballs and AOE blasts, so battles are inherently tenser and more focussed on resource management than in a lot of vanias. Enemies consist of crawling horrors, sniper ghosts, and mallet-wielding machines.
</p>
<p>
I do get some sense that Nothing Beyond This Point will resolve eventually into a straightforward game of room clearance, levelling, and boss battles (I broke off playing the demo after I was slain by a robot-building robot) but then again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321280/Nothing_Beyond_This_Point">the Steam page</a> cautions that "you've seen nothing yet". Haha, I don't see what they did there. I wonder if they have a Cheshire Cat. I wonder if they have crocodiles. Argh.

            <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has dropped. It puts a ten-minute dent into the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s enigma, but the most tantalising question still remains: is Kojima using that subtitle to deliberately remind everybody of the original's <a href="https://youtu.be/5cnXkbUFdBs">most infamous scene</a>? Bold choice if so, although not the only one. Here's the trailer, complete with familiar mechs and very familiar bandanas. See Konami, this is what happens when you pop out for five minutes to re-release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside The Solitude of Prime Numbers's Luca Marinelli wearing a Snakely bandana and a Rex-reminiscent mech, the trailer also has a console release date: 26th June 2025, or 63 days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. This is approximately enough time for players unfamiliar with Kojima's works to pick up Death Stranding 2 on a whim, finish it, buy  Delta of out curiosity, then think "hey, this Snake guy is a total rip-off of Luca Marinelli's character!". A paratextual commentary on identity, memory, and hero worship? Kojima you sly old dog, you've done it again!</p>
<p>Shared as part of a panel at SXSW, the trailer joins news of an <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-concerts-announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">orchestral concert </a>and <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding2_hamilton_announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">a watch</a>. Why, you could wear the watch to the concert and draw attention to yourself in the queue by loudly asking "what time does this thing start, anyway?!" and theatrically glaring at your wrist, then smarmily asking "oh, this old thing?" at great volume to no-one in particular. You'd be really cool if you did that.</p>
<p>It took about eight months for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> to break console containment. If this follows suit, we might well see the sequel on PC by the end of the year. I reckon we got the best of both worlds with the original's late release though: more time to play other games, and a shiny Director's Cut to boot. I enjoyed it so much I was compelled to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/object-ive-review-death-strandings-pizza">spill words aplenty on pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the weekend, hectic 1v1 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> got yet more free maps in an update. The developers added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/509574242369537162">eight new cramped deathzones</a> alongside a further four maps for owners of the "maps 'n' hats" DLC, then threw in a new submachine gun and a music player for good measure. But over on the game's Discord server, amid the mine-laying mercenaries and bum-sliding shootscum, the developers also held a poll that revealed future plans. They asked players what they'd prefer: a 2v2 mode or a four-player free-for-all? </p>
<p>"We'll do both," said devbrother Leonard Lemaitre, "but it's a matter of which one comes first."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The poll, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1124764095623741473/1265760231913422969/1347947995441664121">posted on Saturday</a>, currently puts the presumably chaotic four player free-for-all mode ahead, with twice as many votes as the 2v2 mode, which I can only imagine will be an intense bonding exercise for connoisseurs of early 2000s multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lobbies. Although the poll is being conducted with emojis, and it's possible a lot of voters are getting the "two silhouetted people" emoji confused with the "two silhouettes hugging" emoji, thereby splitting the 2v2 vote. Is there an electoral commission for frenzied first-person killsports? Nah, we can solve this with a first-to-three in Chateaux_13_Alt_Alt. </p>
<p> It's very pleasing to see the game pumping out updates. It was already an "anarchic first-person speed dater you'll fall in love with" according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">Straftat review</a> from Rick, and that was before they added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">another heaving bunch of maps to the concrete bullet brawler</a>. Including this latest update, my estimate is now 192 maps (if you own the DLC) although I could have easily lost count. There's a reason it was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">favourite games of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend's update adds a few other bits and bobs. You can now view your match history in the stats menu, for example. And you can disable your crosshair in the options, if you are some kind of instinctually accursed murder master. Don't matchmake with me, please, I don't like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
