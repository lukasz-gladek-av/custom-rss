            <p>
I've been excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roman-sands-rebuild">Roman Sands RE:Build</a> since the moment I laid my eyes on it, particularly because it's from the same studio behind the ever-haunting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>. Roman Sands just has a ridiculously strong art direction to it, very much one that could easily be dubbed Y2K, but I think more accurately should be seen as an evolution of the aesthetic/ era. Almost as if this is the direction it could have gone in. 
</p>

<p>
Just great stuff, not even counting the oddball gameplay, and as revealed in a new trailer, it's got a release date now too: September 12th. That's close enough for me to count down the days, but far away enough for me to think "I'd like to be playing this right now actually, ta very much." The trailer offered a new look at its strange, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> hotel and all of its guests, as well as a tease for the things you'll be getting up to (all of which seem quite ominous.

<p>
The gameplay itself sees you attending to the demands of said guests as outlandish as they all are, but the clock is working against you. Specifically, a clock that'll see the sun swallowing up the world. Terrifying! And a great hook. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231460/Roman_Sands_REBuild/">There's a demo you can check out on Steam too</a>, or you can just wishlist it if you want to wait for the full thing.
</p>
<p>
Excitingly, the release date trailer also had a mysterious tease for Paratopic: Overdub, seemingly an anniversary edition of the game. Over on its <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2346939?tab=compose">Steam page</a> it's described as a remaster/ remix/ sequel, and look, it could be none of those things and I'd still be in. Paratopic is a peak example of the modern trend of PS1-inspired games, using the aesthetic to really hone in on its subtle horrors. Whatever this new thing contains, I'll take it. It's coming September 12th too, so I'm sure like me you'll be plenty busy that day!

            <p>
Now, I'm not naming any names here, but there's a certain hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> that everyone's a bit sick of waiting for by this point, and could really do with a release date. OK, fine, yes it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and if those recent Steam backend updates mean anything, I expect it'll get some kind of update sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>, also a hand-drawn metroidvania, that actually does have a release date.
</p>

<p>
In Constance, you play as a purple-haired painter who is "striving to escape from a colorful but decaying inner-world, created by her declining mental health." Mental health themes are nothing new in the world of indie games, but that's not what really sells me on Constance. That'd be the tight-looking platforming and snappy, paint-brush oriented combat.

<p>
You literally fight and hop dart around with a massive paintbrush, using it to do pretty much everything, from glooping up the side of a wall, to doing quick brush strokes that let you dodge. Occasionally you'll even have to do some actual painting, if you can believe it! The thing looks lovely too, I'm a sucker for hand-drawn games, as they always feel like labours of love. Aesthetically that certainly seems to be the case here, so I'm hoping the full release lives up to its look. There's a demo to available too, so you and I could always give that a go to find out!
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, release date! That'll be November 24th, a few months away still, but I'm sure you can wait. As I said, I really wouldn't be surprised if Silksong does get dated this weekend, but definitely consider keeping Constance on your radar too, I'm sure more than enough people are going to pick up the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel. You can wishlist Constance on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">here</a>.

I don't think you can more easily sell me on a game than by saying it was made by one of the artists behind Celeste, and has music from Disasterpeace, i.e. the composer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, and It Follows. But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a> is, a horror RPG in the vein of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/neverway-is-a-horror-rpg-stardew-valley-from-one-of-the-artists-behind-celeste">first announced back in April</a>, back with a nice little look-in at yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pedro Medeiros, the Celeste artist in question, and programmer/ writer Isadora Sophia gave a great little rundown of Neverway, explaining that you play as Fiona, a character who much like the player character in Stardew has just quit her dead end job. She's trying to start over on a farm, live the quiet life, except she ends up having to serve as a herald for a dead god because of some debt she owes. Awkward!

That kind of life does end up leading towards the need to fight in a classic Zelda-ish 2D action combat kind of way, but you do have to balance all of that adventuring with your regular life too. That means farming, paying your mortgage, making friends, maybe even falling in love. Those bonds can lead to new combat abilities too, something I wish my own relationships offered me. 
</p>
<p>
Time works a bit differently in Neverway too, as rather than the day slowly tick tocking away, it moves from morning, to afternoon, to night when you do things like eat, sleep, or read a manual of some sort.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you'll end up searching for the titular Neverway, a "decaying nightmarish reality that is slowly leaking into yours." This is where you'll learn about the game's post-apocalyptic world as you pay off your debt.
</p>
<p>
I know "farming sim but dark" isn't exactly a new concept, it's just that Neverway is doing so with such eyecatching style I can't help but be won over by it. It looks like there's a real sincerity to the life-sim elements as opposed to them just being slapped into some dark themes. That's the ticket to my heart honestly, a good bit of earnestness goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
Neverway doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

A. Corey novels and Syfy TV adaptations. It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics. Also, crew romances. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Explore a Divided Solar System: Travel across iconic locations from the TV show and books, like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. While traversing the various environments, players must uncover secrets and influence outcomes through their skills and decisions.</p>
<p>A Story-Driven RPG True to The Expanse: Immerse yourself in a narrative grounded in tension, consequence, and the complexity of humanity's future among the stars</p></blockquote>
<p>Osiris Reborn is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727390/The_Expanse_Osiris_Reborn/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-736f65">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_expanse_osiris_reborn">GOG</a> at a date that is not today, nor tomorrow, but "soon".</p>
<p>The developers are at pains to reassure that they've got a whole new team working on the thing and that there is no overlap with any of Owlcat's other projects, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-is-the-next-tactical-and-bloody-crpg-from-the-devs-behind-rogue-trader">the recently revealed Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>. They're collaborating on the game with Alcon Interactive Group, publishers of The Expanse: A Telltale Story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
