            <p>Remember Prototype, the super hero game which saw Radical Entertainment explore what might happen if a hoodie enthusiast was given shape-shifting powers? Well, it's recieved a sudden and mysterious steam update which adds to its credits, fuelling a fresh bout of speculation that a remaster might be on the cards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said Steam update, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/a-surprise-steam-update-for-prototype-broke-the-mods-making-the-16-year-old-game-playable-on-modern-systems-but-could-hint-at-a-potential-remaster/">Perfectly Cromulent Gamer</a>, is so mysterious that it didn't even come with a handy post indicating what it did, leaving modders and dataminers to try and work out what it was up it with its around 600 MBs of pure enigma.</p>
<p>Based on what they've discovered, the answer includes making some noteworthy additions to Prototype's credits. These include staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned studio that's worked on the likes of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy</a>, amid a lengthy history littered with numerous ports and support projects. Fellow Activision support studios Beenox and Demonware get mentions too, with the former seeing a huge number of folks credited. Finally, a Ubisoft Connect iteration of Prototype, which isn't a thing that currently exists, is also mentioned via references to supposed contributors to it that includes the Beenox devs.</p>
<p>You can find the old credits laid side by side with the revised ones <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/">here</a>, thanks to the Prototype community's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/">super sleuths</a>. Naturally, the conclusion many of these folks have drawn is that some sort of re-release of the 2009 game may be in the works. There's no official confirmation as of yet, however, so make sure to keep your expectations in check.</p><p>I'll admit that for all I've enjoyed plenty of Infamous, I've never gotten around to giving Prototype a go. So let us peruse RPS co-founderperson Alec Meer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-prototype">late 2000s thoughts on it</a> together, in order to help decide whether it's worthy of a modern revamp:</p>
<blockquote> Morality is non-existent in this game of mass, consequence-free killing, after all. All I know: half of Prototype wants me to have sustained, undiluted fun. The other half wants to keep that fun from me at all costs. This is a game that regularly strikes close an unprecedented degree of fantastical wish-fulfilment, but similarly seems determined to punish anyone with the temerity to play it.</blockquote>
<p>I'd say that's a yes, especially given it's a ballache to play on modern PCs without relying on mods like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">PrototypeFix</a>, which in a fun twist the suprise update tempoarily rendered unusable. Luckily, the mod's creator was quick to update it, so you can hop into some working Prototype if this news leaves you keen to re-don Alex Mercer's hood of moodiness.</p>
