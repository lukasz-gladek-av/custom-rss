            <p>Skibidi. Dop, dop, dop. Yes, yes. Skibidi. Double u. Neem, neem. This is the clarion call of the modern age, the infernal message brought unto our virgin ears by the Skibidi Toilets. No, wait, keep reading! It'll be worth it. Probably. After all, the word skibidi has now been added to the Cambridge Dictionary, and this is a reality we've all got to reckon with. </p>
<p>Skibidi Toilet, in case you've been living somewhere free from the influence of vertically-framed surrealism, is a long-running series of 3D animations by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">YouTuber Alexey 'DaFuq!?Boom!' Gerasimov</a>. It generally conveys the tale of a great war between a legion of heads protruding from loos and an army of folks with cameras for heads, with help from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> assets and inspiration from the annals of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a> machinima. Any 12 year olds you know probably can't get enough of it. Or think it's lame because they've already moved on to the next <em>thing</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, as if Michael Bay spearheading efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/michael-bays-skibidi-toilet-movie-production-company-has-apparently-sent-dmca-takedowns-to-garrys-mod">make a Skibidi Toilet movie</a> wasn't enough reason for you to be aware of this lavatory entertainment, the folks behind the Cambridge Dictionary are adding it to their great tome of words <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/18/skibidi-delulu-and-tradwife-among-words-added-to-cambridge-dictionary">this year</a>. I should stress here that it's one of thousands of words being added to the annals. The others include the likes of tradwife, delulu, broligarchy, and mouse jiggler.</p>
<p>"It’s not every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary. We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power," said the tradebook of terminology's lexical programme manager, Colin McIntosh.</p><p>So, the bookish boffins clearly think the skibidi era's more than a passing fad. I for one look forward to historians in centuries' time blowing the dust off of tomes so they can scan through firsthand accounts of the skibidi era. Weathered folks in fields gasping in awe as their trowels unearth plastic designed to resemble part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-latest-update-disabled-mods-meaning-you-can-no-longer-play-as-skibidi-toilet-or-vegeta">G-Toilet's unholy ceramic bowl</a>. I mean, to be fair, they're also definitely going to discover people <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/dfc9cea4-137b-440f-aa8c-5a16d7cb4f4d">posed like this</a> with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> burned into their screens. We can only pray that we're not brought back as Futurama-style heads-in-jars to explain any of this.</p>
<p>At the very least, this cultural event that's just about linked to video games has at least finally taught me what skibidi means. "A word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke", is how the Cambridge  Dictionary defines the term. The example sentence given is "What the skibidi are you doing?".</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, maybe this is the sort of versatile expression <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-is-not-ok-good-is-bad-great-is-the-new-great-and-bioshock-4-is-coming-out-as-take-two-boss-stops-short-of-claiming-that-up-is-down">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a> could use to convey the sorts of games his company are striving to make! If good is bad and great is the new great, then maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> can only be accurately described as skibidi.</p>
<p>I'm preparing to petition my co-workers to add this important term to the RPS style guide, along with an instruction that it must be used in every article that doesn't cover uber-serious news, on pain of death. Wish me luck in climbing out of the skip Edwin, James, and Nic will rightly lob me into.</p>

            <p>The curse of plausibility and coherence lies heavy across this realism-centred artform. These days, you can't even give a platform character a woolly hat without first devising an in-game textile industry with appropriate supply chains, and a whole supporting cast of millworkers with names like Arthur Worsted and Jimmy Shuttlecock. </p>
<p>I prefer the disconnectedness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycutlery">Psycutlery</a>, in which you fight using a telekinetic spork, buy things with frogspawn, heal by eating toothpaste, and checkpoint progress by carving blocks of stone into statues of yourself, using the spork. The in-game reasoning for all this is basically "because developer Luke Tarlowe has the imagination of a Picasso and the attention span of a goldfish". Don't call it CRAZY. Call it refreshingly uninhibited and also, reminiscent of, Decap Attack and Ristar. Also, call it free.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Around a decade in development, and... it's free??" Tarlowe incredulously asks himself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3577630/Psycutlery/">the Steam page</a>. And answers: </p>
<blockquote>Yep.  All I want is to share my work and keep enjoying my game development hobby (without any of the stresses that come from the business side of things)!

This is the full, completed game.  I would like to think of it having ample length and quality comparable to that of a commercial game.  It's a completely original work, having been started between 2011 and 2012.  All characters, art, music and so on are original to this project.  Music was made with the help of me and a few friends (with most of the musical contributions coming from my friend Jon AKA DJ Yoshiman), while everything else has been solo developed by me.  There are absolutely no microtransactions or anything of that sort.  No catches to be found here - I just wish to share my passion with all who might appreciate it.</blockquote>
<p>I've played Psycutlery for about 20 minutes and the only thing I'm iffy about is the quantity of self-aware dialogue writing, which isn't even that obnoxious when compared to, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a>, and is amply offset by the joyfully crackpot platforming mechanics. </p><p>You can pierce enemies with your spork and hurl them at each other, with what I think is the falling object sound effect from Sonic The Hedgehog. You can also fork and devour terrain blocks to secure passage. The levels are a greasy tumult of colours and background animations, like a hungover memory of the Casino Night Zone. There are hidden warpdoors to discover, power-ups that let you sing enemies off-screen, and unlockable B-side variations of each level. The romhack energy is strong with this one.</p>
<p>If you're not fond of Steam, Psycutlery originally <a href="https://eyesineverything.itch.io/psycutlery">released on Itch</a> and is free there too. Thank our lucky stars that Mastercard don't think sporks are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mastercard-and-visa-vs-the-gamers-how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex">some kind of sex toy</a>. Tarlowe is also the creator of Mario fangame <a href="https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb%C2%B6m=02&amp;c=2&amp;id=25698">Psycho Waluigi</a>, which appears to have similar mechanics.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week, soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> got a patch that rendered a number of its bosses unkillable, seemingly in response to pressure from some Chinese players. For those who aren't keen on the patch's changes, which particularly transforms the challenge you'll face in the game's fourth region, there's now a mod dedicated to undoing them by letting you roll back to a previous version.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth view of the changes patch 1.5 made and what they mean for the game, it's well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">our Jeremy's story</a> on it from last week. The short version is that a number of big foes associated with the Ming dynasty have been made to fall down in exhaustion when you defeat them, rather than being killed. As you might imagine, this has implications not just in terms of the minute-to-minute experience of playing Wuchang, but also the story it tells.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s busted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">next-gen update</a> last year, modders are trying to help players who're keen to roll their game back to a previous version. AVK95 has stepped up to the task with the self-explanatory '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">Rollback censorship patch</a>'.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," its creator wrote in the mod's description. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialog from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p>The mod will take you back to version 1.4 of Wuchang, which meas that in getting rid of patch 1.5's boss tweaks, you'll also be ditching more useful changes like quickened up healing animations and a revamping of how Wuchang gets back up after being knocked down. If you choose to download it, you'll get a file called WuchangRollback.exe, which it instructs you to extract and then run in your game's root folder.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you'll have to disable the game's ability to automatically update by heading into its properties menu via your steam library. Lastly, you'll need to start the game each time by clicking a file called 'Project_Plague-Win64-Shipping', rather than clicking play on Steam itself.</p>
<p>It's a fair amount of palaver to go through, but with Steam lacking a feature like fellow storefront GOG.com's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419630535057-The-rollback-feature-reverting-to-a-previous-version-of-the-game">built-in rollbacks</a> for games that don't offer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/164mwsj/psa_how_to_rollback_to_a_previous_game_version_on/">previous versions as betas</a>, it's probably the best you'll get for now. As you saw with that Fallout update, there can be other ways to pull off rolling back a patch, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ccxyxb/pc_players_here_is_a_guide_on_how_to_rollback/">re-downloading old depot files</a>, but that's usually no walk in the park unless you find some instructions you can follow to the letter.</p>
<p>There might end up being a better solution if someone develops a mod that only gets rid of patch 1.5's controversial changes or, ideally, developers Lenzee opt to offer a version of the game that does the same. As of right now, there's just AVK95's mod, which also doesn't work with the Xbox Game Pass version of Wuchang.</p>

            <p>Hello all! And a very happy This Week to you. I'm back from break just in time for Gamescom. Gamescom! *Broadway overture kicks in* A time of booths and blaggardry! Of queues and carousing! Of flinching away from cosplayers promising Free Hugs! Of getting caught in a human logjam between the major exhibition halls and the lavatories! Of miniature walled villages operated by triple-A publishers, hosting their own local culture of finger food! Of strung-out crypto investors filling the alcoves with their musical cries of "DOGECOIN FOR SALE, DOGECOIN FOR SALE!" Of waifu bodypillows and army recruiters! Of finding the event's secret best game tucked away among the b2b stands! Of long walks back to the hotel across the bridge of locks, wondering how it ever came to this!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Such are my terrible memories, anyway. James is attending the Cologne-based games convention for RPS this year. The rest of us will be stationed atop the Treehouse with telescopes and crossbows, scouring the skies for News with which to feed the exuberant and impetuous Maw. In advance of all that, here's a rundown of new PC games, together with the bare bones of a conference schedule.</p>
<h2>Monday 18th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stick-it-to-the-stickman">Stick It To The Stickman</a> entangles corporate careerism with punching with the golden era of Newgrounds animation. Mark has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stickbossman-i-think-youll-find-my-chainsaw-has-an-appointment">sticking it to the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 19th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> is the latest Journey-me-do from Abzu and The Pathless devs Giant Squid. It's about doing ollies on a claymore. I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-an-enveloping-but-not-cutting-meditation-on-flow-journey-and-vintage-tony-hawk">quite impressed</a> by the SGF demo.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/voidbreaker">Void/Breaker</a> is a glistening goldfish bowl full of robots, destructible buildings and moddable guns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757940/Raygun_Gadabout/">Raygun Gadabout</a> is a retro-future sci-fi with splattery Rick &amp; Morty stylings. Possibly an Earthworm Jim for people who don't like Earthworm Jim since its creator went a bit Wrong.</li>
<li>They do the Geoffs in different voices at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, featuring Blandoman Extraordinaire and his Fashion Friends, plus some videogames. The main show starts at 11am PT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 20th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896760/Azooma_Escape/">Azooma Escape</a> is a comedic stealth adventure about breaking out of an overbearing family gathering, from a Saudi independent team.</li>
<li>Xbox are doing their first Gamescom broadcast today at 6am PT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll share further details of the external inquiry Microsoft have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">recently commissioned</a> into their alleged complicity with war crimes.</li>
<li>The Future Games Show is next up on the Gamescom schedule at 11am PDT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST, and 8pm CEST. We can expect: the voice actors behind Solid Snake and Lady Dimitrescu. Now there's a fanshipping for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 21st August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631450/Bean_Beasts/">Bean Beasts</a> is a lushly pixelled tower defender in which your towers are Pokenots and your traps are upgradeable - truly, these are dark times for tower attackers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is about ushering befuddled goat things up a mountain. It's from them wot did Far: Lone Sail.</li>
<li>It's time for Eggsbogs Gamecome All Ye Faithful round two at 6am PDT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST, and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll have another crack at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">justifying the mass layoffs</a> in this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 22nd August</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let's leave Friday wide open and spotless as the freshly fallen snow, to catch any larger unexpected Gamescom revelations. Maybe somebody will wear another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">politically ill-advised hat</a> on stage. Maybe James will go full gonzo. According to my meeting notes, he's promised to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-know-ill-use-deep-rock-galactic-to-identify-the-mushrooms-in-my-palm-pot">eat all those mushrooms he found in his planters last week</a>. I think that would be a wonderful way to close the expo, personally. I'm sure you'll all remind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Broadway overture crackles and slows into a nightmarish series of undersea noises* Good luck with the Geoffalypse, all.</p>
