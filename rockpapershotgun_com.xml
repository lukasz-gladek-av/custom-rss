            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-100">RPS 100</a> is our list of the best games to play on PC. It encompasses the full breadth and width of PC gaming stretching back to 1873, but focuses solely on those games that remain great to play today. It's updated yearly by our crack team of writers, and the first half of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">2024 edition is live now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You might note that the format has changed this year. Instead of a long article to scroll through, the list is presented as a sortable, filterable list of game covers, and you can click on each cover to read the RPS team's  evangelism for that game. We hope that it's a pleasant browsing experience.
</p>
<p>Favouring games that are great to play today means that we've paid no mind to importance or influence, but it doesn't mean we've ignored older games, and you'll find plenty of older classics on the list. We've also made a conscious effort to encapsulate the diversity of experiences available on PC. For a start, that means that all games playable on PC are PC games, no matter where they were first released or what extra peripherals (such as VR headsets) they may require. It also means we've made difficult choices and not simply filled the list with excellent-but-similar sequels from beloved series, except in instances where those games feel significantly different from one another.
</p>
<p>You might, as you browse our selection, wonder when you'll reach the bar charts, diagrams and decimal points which explain the cold mathematical logic of our selections. These things are not present in our list. The RPS100 is a work of human beings, for human beings, and as such has been constructed using the twin blades of subjectivity and taste. We think we have pretty great taste and the expertise to explain ourselves, so if you would like to know how wet a game is, how fungible or how zealous, we have explained our opinions under each game when relevant.</p><p>The second half of the list will go live at noon tomorrow. Don't see your favourite game on there when the list is done? There are too many great PC games for us to include them all, but there are comments below the list where you can share your own great taste and bask in the evangelism of your fellow readers. 
</p>
<p>Go, read, and whether you agree with us or not, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">hope you enjoy this year's RPS 100</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Let’s try and get you up to speed on the fascinating oddity that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ecosystem">Ecosystem</a>, on the off chance that Nate's coverage of it hasn't stuck with you like an unwelcome brain parasite you’re nonetheless unwilling to get removed for fear of the lingering emptiness it might cause (he once described an eel as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-virtual-eel-nearly-became-intelligent-enough-to-grind-my-pc-to-a-halt">“a quaver with erectile dysfunction”</a>). Broadly speaking, this game is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s evolutionary-biology-degree-having cousin. It’s been in early access for about three years now, but with the latest "Crustacean" update, it’s just hit 1.0. Once again, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/">carcinization has come for all things</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here’s how the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133120/Ecosystem/">Steam page</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The nervous system of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs passes through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part. Creatures swim just like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward.”</p></blockquote>

<a aria-label="Ecosystem - Crustacean Update &amp; 1.0 OUT NOW!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DkDZt7C4yQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Ecosystem - Crustacean Update &amp; 1.0 OUT NOW!</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DkDZt7C4yQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4DkDZt7C4yQ?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DkDZt7C4yQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Nate’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ecosystem-has-burst-my-mind-and-you-could-be-playing-it-right-now">attempts to play Poseidon</a> are worth reading up on if you’re curious, but in short, Ecosystem lets you tweak certain environmental factors or traits to guide the evolutionary trajectories of your aquatic abominations, or just start with a clutch of random lifeforms and see how they get on. Most will be too stupid to live - or even move - but a few will have traits that let them survive, and these traits will be passed down to their offspring. 

</p><p>Since Nate last played, the game has added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/3675554043635333909">fishy combat</a>, in which animals now directly attack one another and evolve spikes and hard skin to defend themselves from predators. There's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/4209252160976023355">more complex behaviour</a> that will see them building nests and swimming in groups. Everything down to the way they traverse the ocean is simulated. It looks fascinating. Also: Data!</p>
<blockquote><p>For players who want to monitor their ecosystems closely, there is a lot of data at your fingertips. We’ve got you covered for all the statistics and analysis of your world that you could possibly want - from ecosystem overviews showing population charts for both animals and plants to phylogenetic trees for individual species, allowing you to track your species evolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>To celebrate 1.0, there’s also a chunky 30% discount running until the 22nd of November. I’m very tempted, if only to see how close I get to turning one of these hapless, flailing lifeforms into Godzilla.</p>
