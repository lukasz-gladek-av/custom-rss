            <p>The first bit of DLC for mud-splattered infrastructure setup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> has rumbled out of the garage, bringing with it a couple of new maps, several extra vehicles, and some extra-tough options for those craving a hard time.</p>
<p>One of those fresh rides is a bridge layer, and you best believe it'll end up wedged somewhere improbable with its wheels spinning helplessly once I get my hands on it. How can you mess up motoring towards a gap, and pressing the 'commence bridgening' button? It'll be possible.</p>

<p>Alongside that bridge layer in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2104890/view/521974992851698336?l=english">Rebuild expansion</a>'s offerings are two new Central European maps. The first,  Contamination, is all about cleanup duty following a train crash dumping something not nice in a river thanks to some earthquaking. Then, there's Wash-Out, which as its name suggests is a rather wet venture into a "reclaimed wasteland" to get an oil processor up and running again.</p><p>Developers Saber Interactive have split 100 new missions between the two, many of which will likely amount to pick thing up or unfuck this please, as is the runner series' tradition. I'm a tad disappointed in the fact that aside from the all-new Vostok MU-97 'Ant' bridge layer, the other four extra vehicles are just revamped versions of rides from the base game. There's a bridge layer conversion for the Tayga dump truck, plus beefed up variants of the Thunder scout, Tuz 119 scout, and Mule T1 crane lorry.</p>
<p>That's it for the stuff included in the expansion, but there's also some free stuff on top of that, in the form of the Wayfarer ST7050 fuel truck and some advanced difficulty options. The latter includes "tougher fuel management, harsher convoy conditions, and stricter recovery rules, while adjusting costs and economy for a more demanding, realistic experience".</p>
<p>While these are features some players have been asking for since release, back when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/roadcraft-review-streamlined-building-biz-beset-by-bumbling-ai-bobs">I reviewed it</a> I quite liked the fact that it omitted some of the nitty gritty management you've got to juggle in a lot of these games. It was something that helped set the RoadCraft experience apart from its muddy siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game">Expeditions</a>, both of which are still getting fairly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1465360/view/543367091067028490?l=english">regular</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477340/view/541115291253342913?l=english">additions</a> for those who want an excuse to hop back into them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Brendy summed the RoadCrafting experience up thus in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roadcraft-review">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>RoadCraft is a podcast game, in the same vein as Truck Simulator or Elite: Dangerous. There's a big place for games like this in the world, sims that excel in delivering a specific kind of wonderful and comforting boredom. Slow tasks that act as a reassuring sedative in the manic whorl of life. But RoadCraft's start-and-go flow makes it a bumpier ride for me. I was falling asleep, but I never quite drifted off into its promised dreamland.</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see what he means about the constructadriving sim having a bit of a mixed-up ethos when it comes to taking it slow all of the time, or being able to speed along if you wish. As the Brendo also wrote, whether you enjoy RoadCraft'll likely depend on how much time you're willing to give it, especially when things go wrong.</p><p>If you've dug this sort of thing before and can clear the calendar, this Rebuild expansion looks a decent reason to fire it up. If only to see whether the bridge layer's as satisfying to use as the stump mulchers and tree harvesters.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developers Team Cherry are "working to improve" the game's Simplified Chinese translation, following "quality issues" which have seen its Steam user reviews from those speaking the language drop to "mixed".</p>
<p>As you can easily see thanks to Steam's recent introduction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-now-has-language-specific-review-scores-which-might-make-identifying-certain-review-bombs-easier">language-specific review splits</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/#app_reviews_hash">the mixed reviews</a> are unique to the 6,382 people who've left verdicts in Simplified Chinese so far. For every other language, including Traditional Chinese, the impressions being left are either mostly or overwhelmingly positive, though it's worth noting that a sizeable number are more shows of support for Team Cherry than proper reviews, being based on less than an hour's playtime.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team Cherry have clearly spotted this, with the studio's marketing and publishing director Matthew 'Leth' Griffin having <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963798473700168146">posted a message</a> to Chinese-speaking Skongers. "We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>," he tweeted. "We'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support."</p>
<p>Issues with this translation of metroidvania were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595157852293939174/">flagged online</a> as early as its recent Gamescom demo in late August, with one user describing it as "terrible" and adding "if there are no changes in the official version, I am afraid there is a risk of bad reviews".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another user in that thread added: "If the demo’s text reflects what we’ll see in the final release, I must say the translation style in the demo differs greatly from the first game. Many lines feel unnatural, and some are even quite awkward or confusing in Chinese."</p><p>According to our Guides Writer Jeremy, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">half-Chinese and categorises his knowledge of the language as moderate with speaking fluency</a>, the unnaturalness of the translation appears to stem from the use of classical grammar, a bit like an English translation which uses words like 'thee' and 'thou'. Shakespearean Skong. Sounds like it could be a fun time, were you not just trying to lose yourself in a game you've waited ages for.</p>
<p>Wherefore art thou, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">Eric Barone cameo</a>?</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry's planned translantion tweaks do let Chinese players enjoy jumping about as Hornet as much as many other Steam reviewers appear to be, without being subjected to bardly prose.</p>

            <p>
Late last month, players of Nexon's tactical schoolgirl gacha fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-archive">Blue Archive</a> were horrified to discover that their universe had undergone Koyukification. For context, Kurosaki Koyuki is one of Blue Archive's recruitable characters, a twin-tailed pinkhead known for her immense natural code-breaking skills, her passion for gambling, and her mischievous persona. 
</p>
<p>
On August 31st, Blue Archivists logged onto discover that Koyuki had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleypires.bsky.social/post/3ly2cxqdos22w">multiplied like a virus</a>. Cafes and arcades teemed with duplicates of the character. Her snaggle-toothed rictus filled the game's recruitment banners. The very information page - once a source of guidance and solace to so many - had been edited to read "nihahaha", in mimicry of the character's giggle. 
</p>
<p>
It was kind of like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fVfIejbfM"> this scene from Being John Malkovich</a>, if John Malkovich had been a freakazoid 15-year-old piker armed with a light machinegun. And also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBmH1M4DSSU">the closing scenes from Matrix Revolutions</a> (Koyuki's in-game nickname is "White Rabbit"), if Neo and Agent Smith had decided to lay off the kung fu and sample the local parfait.
</p>
<p>
How to explain these nightmarish events? It was a hack, obviously. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/blue-archive-got-hacked-but-the-hacker-just-spawned-the-same-character-everywhere-without-touching-valuable-data-nexon-confirms/">Automaton West</a>, publishers Nexon took Blue Archive offline for a few hours that Sunday to expunge the excess Koyukis and carry out an investigation. Seemingly, this was the good kind of hack, carried out for the glee of it rather than to filch anybody's credit card details. Or at least, that's what they're saying publicly.
</p><p>
<a href="https://forum.nexon.com/bluearchive-en/board_view?board=3028&amp;thread=3123126">According to Nexon</a>'s subsequent notice to players, somebody managed to break into the game's content delivery network and mess with the environment settings, which are managed separately from the game itself, redirecting them to an IP address in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The hacker's changes only "affected the client-side content display", it seems. Nexon say that "players' accounts, game data, and payment information were not affected, as they are operated in a separate database and always revalidated by the game server."
</p>
<p>
You may find the idea of your online gameworld being suddenly suffused by goblin cryptanalysts amusing. Rest assured that Nexon do not. Aside from introducing new restrictions and countermeasures, they've reported the whole ordeal to the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency. They've also prepared a player compensation package of in-game McGuffins to say sorry for the emergency maintenance period. Thoughts and prayers, etc.

</p>
<p>Is Blue Archive worth playing post-Koyukification? I can tell you nothing save that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHy8JmWX3kw&amp;t=62s">this trailer</a> thoroughly weirded me out with its bright and breezy scenes of school life in which everybody present is packing enough firepower to clear out a Terminid nest.</p>
