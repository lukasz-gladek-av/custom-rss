The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>, producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a>, editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a>, lead writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">Trick Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a> have all announced that they're looking for work.
</p>
<p>
All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager George McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"Today, we are turning towards the future and preparing for the next chapter in BioWare's story," reads the full post from McKay, which was <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">published yesterday</a>. "As we announced in August 2023, we are changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards."
</p>
<p>For context, the August 2023 announcement was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-lays-off-around-50-employees-as-work-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age-dreadwolf-continues">this one</a>, in which McKay revealed that BioWare would chop 50 roles in the course of "reorganizing our team to match the studioâ€™s changing needs."</p>
<p>
BioWare are now doing some more reorganising, after ending production of a massive RPG. According to McKay, a "core team" led by Mass Effect trilogy veterans, including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley, are currently working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, or whatever they end up calling it. Other people have been transferred to other EA projects, with the quiet part being that they face redundancy if suitable roles are not to be found.
</p><p>
"In keeping with our fierce commitment to innovating during the development and delivery of Mass Effect, we have challenged ourselves to think deeply about delivering the best experience to our fans," McKay continues in this week's blog post. "We are taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare.
</p>
<p>
"Given this stage of development, we don't require support from the full studio," he continues. "We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."
</p>
<p>
Our fellow Zifflings at Ian Games have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">asked</a> BioWare and EA how many people have been laid off or retained in the course of the above "reimagining". According to a spokesperson, "while we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development." Which, again, is a very slippery way to say that a bunch of people are now unemployed.
</p>
<p>
Some more context for these decisions. Firstly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard hasn't sold enough for EA. The RPG "engaged approximately 1.5 million players" in the publisher's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">last reported financial quarter</a>, which was "down nearly 50% from the company's expectations". The game's most recent update was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-just-received-its-final-major-update">worded in such a way as to suggest there wouldn't be any more</a>. Game director Corinne Busche left BioWare earlier this month, though she has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">this departure was voluntary</a>.
</p><p>
Secondly, the fourth main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> game appears to have been quite a complicated production, even by blockbuster RPG standards. It began life in 2015 as a smaller, narrative-focussed project called "Joplin". Then EA and BioWare tried to turn it into a live service game, based on the code for ill-fated mechsuit bonanza Anthem. When Anthem flopped, they dumped the new Dragon Age project's multiplayer elements. That's around 10 years of decisions and indecisions, with key staff leaving in the interval - Joplin's original team lead Mike Laidlaw is now founder and director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> developers Yellow Brick Games.
</p>
<p>
You can understand why EA and BioWare might want to avoid such a situation again. And while it may not be defensible - EA earned billions of dollars last year, and appear to be profitable - it's sadly not unusual for studios to scale back once they've shipped a big game, even when it has sold relatively well. I don't particularly doubt McKay's assertion that sincere efforts have been made to place people elsewhere. Still, if you're going to let a bunch of people go, you could at least do them the courtesy of saying that out loud.

            <p>Looks like they finally got the message. "An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">a short and quiet blog post</a> that includes the upcoming PC release for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II</a>. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, and later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">a rough review-bombing</a> but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The post itself is brief and plain, and spins the decision as a way for PlayStation to offer "in-game content incentives" to any PC player who decides to sign in not as a requirement but as an option. "Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management," they say, before showing a table of the extra goodies account linkers will get for each game.</p>
<p>This is similar to what the company did for open world sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Zero Dawn: Forbidden West</a>, which offered players a bonus outfit and spear for protagonist Aloy if they linked their Steam and PSN accounts. It looks like that may be the approach from now on. Although PlayStation don't explicitly say so outright. They only say that all the games which so far required the account are having that requirement dropped. I guess we'll see when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> comes out. </p>
<p>The whole saga has been quite stupid. PlayStation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement for Helldivers 2</a> after players (and the game's developers) got supremely annoyed with the decision, but the hullaballoo resulted in a community manager <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disgruntled-helldivers-2-fans-start-petition-to-bring-back-fired-community-manager">losing his job</a>. Following that, the account requirement was instituted on the above mentioned games, which many players pointed out were single player adventures, with no requirement to be online (aside from unspoken DRM reasons, that is). </p><p>The decision made the games unavailable to PC players in over 100 countries where it is currently not possible to sign up for Sony's service (not to mention slightly annoying anyone else who doesn't even own a PlayStation console). Most recently, they said the account <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-making-it-unplayable-in-over-100-countries">would be required on the upcoming PC release of Last Of Us Part II</a>, due out in April. But now that too won't need a PSN account. Instead, if you sign on optionally, you'll get an in-game jacket inspired by Naughty Dog's new upcoming sci-fi adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. </p>
<p>God, let this be the end of it. It was a stupid decision, irritated a ton of players, and probably only benefited some number crunchers in a department buried deep in Sony's corporate bowels. Now that it's just an option, we can all get back to deciding if the games are actually good or not.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
