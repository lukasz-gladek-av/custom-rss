            <p>
People love to go on and on about how good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2's</a> campaign mode is, and they'd be right to do so, but really we all know there's one specific level we have in mind when it comes to the sidelined shooter: the time travel one. I don't care for shooters all that much, online or offline ones, yet I still gave a go because the time travel level really appealed to me mechanically. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored 2's</a> similarly structured time travel section wooed me similarly, so I was very pleased to discover the newest trailer for Tenet of the Spark this week, an action-adventure game that is basically Titanfall 2 and Dishonored 2's time travel levels made into an entire game.

Tenet of the Spark has a few things that sets itself differently from said two levels. In the first instance, it's pretty much all melee combat. Punchin', hammerin', knife throwin', that sort of thing. Where the time travel element is most notably different is that you can travel between three time periods: modern day, the Viking age, and the Aztec era. The thing that I'm finding most fun from the game's trailer, as you can see above, is that the level design is more or less the same across all three time periods, with the set dressing being the big thing to change.

<p>
Enemies themselves stay in the same spots throughout the three periods too, with each setting looking to have its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, in the Viking setting, you can throw or push objects, and you've got a big ole hammer you can smack things with, whereas in the Aztec period you've got a knife you can chuck at baddies for some long-distance options.
</p>
<p>
It's neat! And stylish as all hell too, I love the effect of the environment changing between time periods, everything shifts and pops a little bit, it's not just swapping you from one scene to the next. The game has been in the works for a little while now, but doesn't have a release date just yet. If it takes your fancy, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2565010/Tenet_of_the_Spark/">wishlist it here</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, you might have seen the abomination that was an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leaked-video-shows-playstation-toying-with-aloy-from-horizon-as-an-ai-chatbot">AI-powered version of Horizon series protagonist Aloy</a>. It came as part of a leak that showed Sony experimenting with the ability to chat to video game characters that use OpenAI and Chat-GPT to respond, though Sony quickly saw to scrubbing any evidence of footage using the power of copyright laws. Notably the voice behind this AI version of Aloy was not that of her voice actor's, Ashly Burch, but the voice actor has offered up her own thoughts on the whole situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Quite quickly in the video Burch shared to TikTok, she explained that developer Guerilla had contacted her to claim that the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development", and importantly didn't use any of her vocal or facial performance. Even with that, Burch did still say she feels "worried", not about "Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form."
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
As Burch points out, The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a>) is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">currently on strike</a>, specifically because of concerns over AI being used to replace actors in the game development process, and that they're asking for protections from its usage. This includes very reasonable things like requiring consent before making an AI version of the actor in question, fair compensation, and to be informed of how the AI dub is being used.
</p>
<p>
For Burch, her concern is a video like this coming out that is based on someone's performance, and "the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn't have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."
</p>
<p>
The leaked video is just a tech demo, it's not something we'll necessarily see implemented in any games or for other purposes, but personally I hope it stays as buried as Sony's lawyers are trying to make the footage. Fingers crossed SAG-AFTRA gets their needs met.
