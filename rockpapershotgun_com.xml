Undoubtedly the only thing anyone in the PC world will be talking about for the next week is Valve's trio of hardware announcements, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, and their new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>. But don't forget about the old Steam Deck just yet! While Valve didn't announce anything handheld related today, they have commented on where they're at when it comes to anything like a Steam Deck 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">IGN</a>, Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais shared that there are plans for an upgraded version of the Steam Deck somewhere along the line, it's just that the technology just isn't there yet. "Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product," Griffais  said.
</p>
<p>
He noted how Valve isn't interested in marginal improvements of performance at the same battery life, and that they "want something a little bit more demarcated than that… and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>
Not that we should be encouraging hours upon hours of playing games, but battery life is one thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">even the Steam Deck OLED struggles with</a>. It does run better than the original Steam Deck, it just also isn't necessarily all that suited for taking on the go, which is kind of the point of these things. Hopefully Valve have plans bigger than just better battery life. I dislike that new generation of consoles offer uniformly the same experience as their predecessors but with slightly fancier graphics, and don't want to see that in a hypothetical Steam Deck 2.

How about that Steam Machine, 'ey? Consoles are now computers and computers are now consoles. What a topsy turvy world we're living in! I'm sure you have lots of questions, a lot of which I hope can be answered by James' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">hands-on look at the thing</a>, but you may still be wondering how you'll know what games will actually work on it. The Steam Deck has its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">fancy verified badge</a> that certifies that a game runs on the handheld, and it turns out that same badge is one that'll come in handy for the Steam Machine.
</p>
<p>
In a stunningly brief <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/563639634283728255">blog post</a> from Valve discussing its trio of hardware announcements, there's also a bit about what this all means for developers. No, don't run away, it's relevant to you too! Valve explains that its verified program will be expanded to include both the Steam Machine and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, promising more details soon. However! As they note, "if your games are already Steam Deck Verified, they'll automatically be verified on Steam Machine."
</p>
<p>
Essentially, it does sound like there will be unique verified badges for the Machine and the Frame, but any games you've hoarded for your Steam Deck thus far that are Steam Deck verified are already ready to go on that Steam Machine you've already bought in your head.
</p>
<p>
For those of you that actually are developers, Valve also says that they've launched a Steam Frame developer kit program. Apparently they're quite limited, but the company does plan to send kits out on an "ongoing basis."
</p>
<p>
So, when the next Steam sale approaches, and you notice that out of your list of 20 games, 17 of them are Deck verified, you can purchase safely knowing that they'll also be playable on Valve's sort-of-console. I'm sure this will help with your religious-scripture-length backlog.
