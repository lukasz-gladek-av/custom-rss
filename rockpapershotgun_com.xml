            <p>
It's been quite a while since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/grasshopper-manufacture">Grasshopper Manufacture</a> put out a completely original game, almost a decade in fact, with 2016's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/let-it-die">Let It Die</a>. Since then there's been a couple <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>, but during a presentation held last night from some company I've never heard of, PlayStation I think it was, the developer revealed something wholly new: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>. This was easily my personal highlight because of how balls to the wall stupid it looks, but it was missing an important thing known as a release date that a lot of other games actually featured for once. And that's almost definitely because Grasshopper is a bit worried about GTA 6.
</p>
<p>
"At this point, our development team is working at full force to get this thing finished," executive director and studio founder Goichi "Suda51" Suda said in a press release. "Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly. I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened)."

<p>
When asked directly about why Romeo Is A Dead Man has a release window as vague as 2026, Suda51 quite plainly said "That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it? That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."
</p>
<p>
Yeah, that all sounds like Suda51 alright. Romeo Is A Dead Man certainly sounds like one of his games too. It follows the titular Romeo, an FBI Space-Time special agent (sure!) whose grandfather uses some fancy tech to stop him from dying, so he's in a constant state of being between life and death. 
</p>
<p>
As him you'll go hunting for fugitives across multiple universes, slicing them up in impeccable gory fashion with a big ole sword. It is undoubtedly a future 7/10 in the making, and I couldn't be more thrilled.

            <p>The developers who create Guilty Gear, the punishing 2D fighters with slick anime visuals, are working on a Marvel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> in partnership with the comics giant. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is a flashy over-the-top wreck sesh, at least judging by the trailer shown off during last night's State of Play, the showcase of new games by Playstation. You can very quickly see how punchin' pros Arc System Works have put their own spin on some Marvel staples such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Storm. There is a (to me) terrifying catch - the fights are 4v4 tag battles.</p>

<p>Wonderful. Total chaos. No idea who is even punching who. The 4v4 tag element is scary to me, yes, and the developers appear to anticipate such trepidation, seeking to reassure players that there will be means of simplifying fights if you are likewise overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game," said game director Kazuto Sekine in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">a PlayStation blog</a>. "We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together...."</p>
<p>Characters will have "normal" , "special" and "unique" attacks, we're told, as well as "ultimates" that align with their characters' particular wheelhouse. Ghost Rider does a lot of whipping, and his motorbike will make a violent appearance. Storm will cause a vicious whirlwind. You get the idea, but here's the full roster of fighters, because I know you want to see if Taskmaster is there (he's not). </p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Star Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Ms Marvel</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Doctor Doom</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a decent slice of the Marvel pie. Regarding their visual design, the developers reportedly went back and forth with Marvel, trying to stick to some traditions. But some honchos at Marvel kicked the designs back and insisted the devs do things their own way.</p>
<p>"Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style," said Takeshi Yamanaka, "but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more Arc-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style Arc is known for."</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. Arc System Works are generally well-respected fighting game developers among fisticuffs fans, having continued the Guilty Gear series for years, most recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>. They also made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, which contributor Aron Garst enjoyed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-pc">review</a>, and the equally outlandish BlazBlue brawlers, which everyone at RPS is afraid to play. That includes me, the only person here who likes fighting games. I am not fooled by Arc System Works' words of reassurance, I just <em>know</em> Dr Doom is going to crush my windpipe and I won't get a single hit in. I'll stick to my beloved Tekken. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have revealed the new gear that'll be arriving in the game with its next warbond on June 12, and there's an armour set that seems inspired by another franchise high on authoritarian satire, Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm surprised it's taken that long for one of the warbonds - which as plenty of people have pointed out often amount to giving players a way to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">look even more fascisty</a> than you do by default in Helldivers 2 - to dip into something Dredd-ish.</p>

<p>As you can see towards the end of the trailer above, this armour set  - dubbed the BP-77 Grand Juror - will become purchasable from the game's superstore once this latest warbond goes live. There's a cape, pistol and player card to go with it, if you want to complete the look.</p>
<p>It's interesting, if understandable given how many HD2 players have been clamouring to dress up like Dredd, that Arrowhead's opted to sell this set separately to the similarly-themed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/05/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-launches-june-12/?sf277523410=1">Force of Law warbond</a> it's dropping the same day. Both are about looking like a militarised cop (or a regular cop, given the times we live in), after all.</p>
<p>As it stands, if you spend your Super Credits on the warbond, you'll get the usual little collection of fresh stuff all in one bundle. There are two armours - the medium BP-20 Correct Officer set and light BP-32 Jackboot set, the former of which looks to have drawn some visual cues from Robocop with the shape of its helmet's visor, potentially ticking yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">beloved satire box</a>.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there's the AR-32 Pacifier assault rifle and G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which sticks to enemies and downs them with electrical pulses. There's also the AX/ARC-3 'Guard Dog' K-9 stratagem, which is basically a gun taped to a drone that follows you around and makes sure an enemy doesn't lay down the law on your backside while you're distracted by some Super doughnuts.</p>
<p>As some of the folks on Reddit who're trying infer an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ko4aag/my_take_on_the_recent_warbonds_are_telling_a/">extra bit of story</a> from Arrowhead's warbond deployment have pointed out, it's arguably a bit weird to get military police gear just as the Galactic War's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">moved away from Super Earth's streets</a>. But hey, it's a chance to shout that you're the law as you take down some bots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
