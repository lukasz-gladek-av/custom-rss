            <p>Gearbox and Take-Two Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched to cries of "pretty good" from (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">some</a>) professional reviewers, and "Stutterland bugfest" from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">a vocal portion of the Steam playerbase</a>. In amongst the complaints about performance, there are some fears about potential breaches of player privacy supposedly allowed for by Take-Two's terms of service. A Borderlands developer has now responded to these fears in the Steam forums, reiterating that Take-Two at large aren't in the business of "spyware".
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/">the statement on Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service.
</p>
<p>"Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations," it goes on. "Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience."</p>
<p>The statement gives a couple of examples of more innocuous data collection, such as sponging up player and device identifiers to ensure compatibility with platforms, or making usernames visible to other players, together with more ambiguous practices like gathering data "to better understand how players play games".
</p><p>The statement also seeks to clarify Take-Two's policy towards mods, noting that they "prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to", but do not "generally" take action against mods "that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties." I'm not that familiar with the Borderlands modding scene, but Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somebody-recreated-all-of-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-gta-5-aaaaand-its-gone">have a legendarily iffy relationship with GTA modders</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">Perignon Champagne Gamer</a>, the concern about Take-Two spyware dates back at least to May this year, when a Youtuber video about <a href="https://www.take2games.com/privacy/en-US/">the publisher's recently revised TOS</a> sparked a short-lived uproar.</p>
<p>I do not want to hand over any of my data to any particular large corporation, myself, but I have to say, I don't see anything in that TOS that strikes me as out of the ordinary, for better and worse. Suspicion is the appropriate response to such things, but exaggeration helps nobody. I've read a few comments that assume that Take-Two are automatically hoovering up everything mentioned in the list of possible data types collected, the second you boot up a game, rather than when you deliberately opt into certain services, such as Borderlands 4's irritating SHiFT service for cross-play.</p>
<p>I am adding "interview somebody to do a proper explainer about data collection practices and privacy" to our endlessly extendable, usefully hypothetical Long Term Features trello. While we're at it, we could look into related anxieties about anti-cheat and DRM, which have recently resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call Of Duty and Battlefield requiring that you enable secure boot on PC</a>.</p><p>The TOS aside, some Borderlands 4 players are concerned about the game's usage of two types of digital rights management - the infamous Denuvo software, which has been cited by a few of the reviews that mention launch performance problems, with proprietary Symbiote software stacked on top. We interviewed a Denuvo executive last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-respond-to-their-rep-for-tanking-games-im-a-gamer-myself-and-therefore-i-know-what-im-talking-about">about their reputation for tanking games</a>.

            <p>You're gonna have to wait a bit longer to murder the steeple for a second time, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-ii">Slay The Spire II</a>'s early access release having just been delayed until March next year. Developers Mega Crit have at least cushioned the blow by revealing the day of the week it'll arrive. A Thursday. Which Thursday? The cheeky folks won't say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After a lot of internal discussion, we've made the call to move Slay the Spire 2's Early Access launch to a secret Thursday in March 2026," Mega Crit wrote in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829?l=english">September newsletter on Steam</a>. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!) Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time."</p>
<p>"There's no single dramatic reason," they added. "Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Thus follows a brief Q&amp;A section in which the studio ruled out some theories about the delay folks might have had, such as it being yet another product of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s launch gobbling up a huge amount of attention. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong’s date was announced," Mega Crit community manager Demi wrote. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>They did acknowledge that adding a lot more new stuff to the formula established by the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> is part of the impetus for the change, but made clear this sequel shouldn't become a game that gets "repeatedly delayed with no explanation". "For one thing, you should never expect radio silence from us," Mega Crit explained. "That’s why we’re here talking to you now. And, as opposed to a general release year, we have an actual specific date that we’re aiming for internally and are confident we can hit this time."</p>
<p>With that out of the way, the devs teased another of Slay the Spire 2's new features, alternate acts. Basically, once you unlock it, when you enter a new act over the course of your run you can trigger a choice between two paths with different environs and foes. The example given is one route offering "a lush, tangled ruin with much of its fauna resembling mystical woodland creatures and sentient flora that might just eat you alive", while the other's "a miry waterway connected to the Spire's sewer system, from which all manner of mutant sea creatures and vagrants might emerge".</p>
<p>The game won't launch with all of the planned alternate acts in place, with some set to arrive down the line as part of early access updates.</p>
<p>If you've not given the original Slay the Spire a go, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review">RPS founderperson Alec Meer's review</a> of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikey</a> deckbuilding. The strapline reads "a miracle of design", so I think it's fair to assume his thumb was pointed skywards.</p>
