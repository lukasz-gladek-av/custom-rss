            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> recently concluded its first Expedition, this being a voluntary, narrative-led character reset achieved by hoarding and donating resources over a set period. The idea is vaguely that you’re funding a mighty caravan to the boondocks. In return, you’ll get tiered rewards such as faster progression, bonus skill points and a larger stash. Participation in Expedition is split across various stages with different completion requirements – the final leg of the first one saw players amassing non-specific items worth hundreds of thousands of coins.</p>
<p>Being opt-in, Expeditions are designed to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">a gentler alternative</a> to the playerbase-wide seasonal ‘prestiging’ mechanics or progression wipes of other online games. Developers Embark say just over a million people took part in the first Expedition – Arc Raiders has sold around 12 million copies to date – with "something close to about 35% or 40%” of those players bagging the full set of Expedition skill points, in the words of design director Virgil Watkins.</p> <!--more--><p>
I am no StatWhisperer and cannot say whether this is an amazing success, by the standards of games with progress resets. Watkins feels it’s a good start, but also says there’s room for improvement. Specifically, he thinks the closing stage of the inaugural expedition was too much of a slog for pennies.
</p><p>"One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points,” he told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">PCGamesN</a> in a new interview, “and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on."</p>
<p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p><p>Watkins would like future Expeditions to be about more than amassing huge amounts of cash. "We completely acknowledge that it isn't the most engaging thing to just go for money,” he continued, “[and it has] the potential outcome of disincentivizing using your gear, which is kind of what people look forward to towards the end of a reset cycle. So yeah, we're looking at revisions on that." </p>
<p>Aside from going over reactions to the Expedition rewards in themselves, the developers are studying player data to see if they can "bring a little more variety" to the process for more casual Expedition participants. They don’t want these players to “feel as though they're being left [behind]," Watkins said.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m rarely enticed by opportunities to ‘prestige’ a character. I don’t find grinding for the privilege of giving it all away very prestigious. I’d be more interested if there were some degree of mystery involved – perhaps it could be less about building percentages, more about solving an oblique puzzle that requires a resource investment of some kind.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that designing what are broadly exercises in rebalancing an in-game economy takes a lot of skill - Embark have elsewhere talked to us intriguingly about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">the dark art of creating a “meaningful” item meta</a>. Anyway, did you join the Expedition? How did it go?</p>

            <p>Ubisoft expect to lay off 55 people across Tom Clancy's The Division developers Massive in Malmö, Sweden and cloud computing studio Ubisoft Stockholm, as part of wider cost-cutting. Reportedly, the job-lossenings are necessary because not enough workers have participated in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">an earlier voluntary redundancy scheme</a> at Massive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” the publishers say in a statement passed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">IGN</a>, who "understand" that the aforesaid Voluntary Leave Program didn't do numbers sufficient for management.</p>
<p>"These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams," the statement continues.</p>
<p>Ubisoft add that “the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged”, dangling hints about “an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup”. For context, Ubisoft Stockholm <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">currently state on their website</a> that “we’re working hard on something new and ambitious, and we can’t wait to share with you what it is”.</p><p>Ubisoft say that the impacted studios will continue to “play a central role” in development of Ubisoft’s Snowdrop engine – also used by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/settlers-2022">The Settlers: New Allies</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and the digital distribution service Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>IGN report that development of The Division series “will still continue as a matter of priority”, based on conversations with Ubisoft. The publishers announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">“building a team” to make The Division 3</a> back in September 2023, alongside updates for The Division 2 (which will get a time-limited DLC Realism Mode in March, amongst other trinkets, as part of the series’ 10 year anniversary festivities). There’s also an upcoming extraction mode, The Division 2: Survivors, and most recently, reports of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-definitive-edition-looks-like-it-may-be-thing-assuming-this-poster-in-japans-the-real-deal">Definitive Edition of the original game</a>.</p>
<p>This is the second major round of cuts Ubisoft have announced in the whole entire two first weeks of 2026. Last week, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">closed Ubisoft Halifax</a> shortly after the studio voted to unionise, insisting that there was no connection between these events. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>"AI is bad, game will be deleted 30.1" reads the headline of the latest a Steam update post about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a>, a rock-paper-scissors-themed roguelike card battler which includes AI-generated assets. "AI is evil, and game will be deleted 30.1" adds the sub-heading of that same update post, just in case the first line didn't make the situation clear enough.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developer Eero Laine, who also looks to go by Rakuel, then kicks off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3435450/view/525364745339929910?l=english">the post</a> in earnest by emphasising for a third time that their game - released in July last year - will disappear from the storefront on January 30th. The reason is a change of heart from Laine on the use of AI generation tech.</p>
<p>"I made this game during the summer in a couple of months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so," they continue. "But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason they get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the post, the dev credits "the girl I've been dating for a month" as having helped them come to this conclusion. As much as 'person meets woman, woman makes good points about the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI, person pulls game which uses generative AI from store' is a romantic tale worthy of big screen adaptation, I'm both slightly concerned and put off by Laine laying some of the blame at the feet of their university's alleged AI-positive brainwashing. I'd argue that by the age people typically go to uni, they should be mature enough to at least be somewhat prepared to make their own decisions and scrutinise things before committing to using them.</p><p>Regardless, Laine's come to this decision now. As for Hardest's future, they added: "I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players." So, a return without the AI-generated bits sounds like it may be on the cards down the line.</p>
<p>You'd hope this kind of update post is something we'll keep seeing from time to time going forwards, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">developers as prominent as Larian</a> facing vocal scrutiny from players regarding the use of generative AI in game development.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired by Rockstar</a> last year on the charge of leaking information about the upcoming game have been denied interim relief, as they and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain begin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">their legal case</a> against the company for alleged union-busting. </p>
<p>Interim relief is a legal mechanism whereby dismissed employees get short-term emergency financial help from their employer. The IWGB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-continue-to-claim-firings-were-about-preventing-gta-6-leaks-as-union-push-to-get-devs-interim-relief">requested</a> last week that a UK employment tribunal grant interim relief to 31 fired Rockstar employees. Had the request been granted, the ousted workers would have been put back on Rockstar’s payroll and had any cancelled work visas reinstated.</p>
<p>Naturally, Rockstar are interpreting the rejection as supporting their case that the workers were fired for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, rather than because they were trying to unionise. A spokesperson has told IGN that the judge’s decision “is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.”</p>
<p>The IWGB, meanwhile, argue that obtaining interim relief was always going to be “an incredibly high bar to meet”, and that the setback “does nothing to dampen our hopes of winning justice when the full hearing takes place”. They call attention to employment judge Frances Eccles’s ruling that “there was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” [on Discord].</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-says-we-stand-by-our-course-of-action-as-judge-rejects-fired-gta-6-developers-application-for-interim-relief">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge">Bloomberg</a>, the hearing includes a little more from either side about what exactly happened on the union organiser Discord channel in question, though this is just a preliminary procedure - the bulk of claims and evidence are to follow when the case goes to court.</p>
<p>According to the ruling from Eccles, over half of the roughly 350 members of the Discord were members of the IWGB, but some were no longer employed by Rockstar. One of the channel’s members is said to have written articles about video games, including one about Rockstar and GTA.</p>
<p>To give some background on that latter allegation, Rockstar <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">“indicated” to IGN</a> back in December that one member of the Discord was a game journalist, while another was an employee of a rival developer. Rockstar has claimed that moderators were not aware of the identities of every member of the channel, creating a security risk.</p>
<p>IWGB communications officer Jake Thomas has countered that all members of the Discord were either union staff or officials or Rockstar employees, with moderators removing members after learning that they had left the company. Thomas did, however, concede that one union official present in the channel had previously written "a couple of articles for a paper, but is a game worker and union rep and was in the group in that capacity."</p><p>Rockstar have yet to say much about the nature of the “confidential information” allegedly being shared, though IGN report that it’s a mixture of “specific game features, comments on the overall progress of GTA 6 development, timelines to launch, and company IT security protocols” – all details Rockstar believe could damage parent company Take-Two Interactive’s share price, if they were made public. Some of these claims have been corroborated by other sources. In November, an anonymous Rockstar insider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">claimed to People Make Games</a> that the firings followed a discussion of changes to the company’s internal Slack policy.</p>
<p>Judge Eccles also notes in her ruling about interim relief that, besides the 31 people let go in the UK, Rockstar dismissed three employees in Canada who were not members of the union. As such, she argues that their union membership could not have been a factor in their dismissal.</p>
<p>The fired developers are represented by Lord John Hendy KC – who, yes, is an actual Lord in the House of Lords. Among other things, he argued in the hearing that no information had actually been leaked to the press and public, and that it is not in itself “gross misconduct” (as Rockstar has previously stated) to share confidential information in a group containing external third parties.</p>
<p>The IWGB have released a statement in response to the tribunal ruling. It claims that the hearing has revealed “that many procedural guidelines were broken in the process of firing these employees, including there being no disciplinary meetings, no chance for appeal until six weeks later, and no evidence of an investigation. Comments relied on by Rockstar’s lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring.'”</p><p>The IWGB also argue that “[r]ather than focusing their case on evidence that Rockstar acted fairly and reasonably in their decision to fire 31 people on the spot, the argument resided largely on legal technicalities, with Rockstar's lawyers declaring that it doesn’t matter if the dismissals were unfair, or if the leadership that dismissed them acted with malice.”</p>
<p>The dismissal of the Rockstar workers has sparked protest action outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two Interactive’s offices in London</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North’s headquarters in Edinburgh</a>. It has also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised in Parliament</a>, with prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">calling it “a deeply concerning case”</a>.</p>
