            <p>Microsoft have reportedly cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at ZeniMax Online Studios, developers of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a>, as part of the company's wider layoffs.</p>
<p>This is according to a post from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which follows separate reports that the layoffs have seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>. It very much looks like a pool of canned projects are accumulating at MS's feet as part of these cuts, though the company are still yet to confirm anything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG was codenamed "Blackbird" and had been in development since 2018, according to Schreier. It would have been the second game ZOS has been principal developer of since their founding in 2007, the first being Elder Scrolls Online, which has received regular updates and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">expansions</a> in the decade and change since release.</p>
<p>While we've not seen or heard much about Blackbird over the years, ZeniMax Online Studios posted job applications seeking people to work on a new engine for a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-boss-says-his-devs-have-been-killing-it-confirms-the-studio-is-working-on-a-new-game-with-a-new-engine/">around 2019</a>.</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot bringing the world of The Elder Scrolls to life, and it's time for us to take those lessons and build a new AAA IP," reads a <a href="https://www.zenimaxonline.com/joinus">careers page on ZOS' website</a>. "The vision for our next game is grand in every sense of the word, and that's why we're developing a new engine to support the needs of the project and studio. Because we're in early pre-production, this is the perfect time to join us and make your mark on an incredible new project."</p>
<p>If the reports are legit, it's sad we'll never get to see what Blackbird could have evolved into. I've never really gotten that into ESO despite loving an old roll of paper, simply because I prefer Elder Scrolls as a single player game. But much like its brother from another mother <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, ESO has certainly stuck around for the long haul, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-wasnt-the-biggest-threat-to-the-elder-scrolls-online-it-was-skyrim">evolving a lot over the years</a> and establishing a loyal audience.</p>
<p>As much as the reported game cancellation sucks, though, it's obviously the people being impacted by these layoffs that really matter. "As one illustration of just how sloppy and chaotic today's mass Xbox layoff has been," Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsykj2ccls22">follow-up post</a>, "some employees at Zenimax Online Studios are now watching their Slack accounts abruptly get locked out. No message from HR, no word on whether they still have a job, just an ominous Slack deactivation."</p>

        <p>Hopefully Arrowhead's refund hotline will be a bit less jammed after August</p>

            <p>If you're prone to passing the bread at the supermarket, totally forgetting you've already got plenty at home, picking some fresh up because you probably need bread, then realising later that you now own two full loafs with the same best before date, I have good news for you. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are taking action to stop something similar happening when people buy the game's Super Citizen Edition.</p>
<p>They're replacing the Steeled Veterans warbond in this special edition with a token that you'll be able to redeem for any one of the warbonds released for the game so far. The aim is to prevent those who're already Steeled Veterans owners - via in-game purchase or by upgrading to the Super Citizen Edition - accidentally buying the war bond again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-se/games/helldivers-2/latest-news-and-updates/?blog=JN9kex2X1qlKXB8&amp;article=BpwjMPDzY2rkga1&amp;slug=warbond-token-announcement">a post</a> from Arrowhead, the warbond token will replace the Steeled Veterans warbond in the Super Citizen Edition and the associated upgrade for the standard edition. The change comes into effect on August 26th 2025.</p>
<p>"We never want players to buy things twice and not get the value of what they paid for," the studio's social media and community manager Katherine Baskin wrote. I've no doubt that's true, but the bigger reason for the change is definitely to stop Arrowhead's support team from having to keep processing an endless supply of super credit refund requests from narked players who've ended up double warbonding.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Helldivers, we’ve been listening to our community and we’re here to let you know of an upcoming update to the HELLDIVERS 2 editions.</p><p>We’re introducing the Warbond Token! It&nbsp;will allow players who purchase the HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen Edition or HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen… <a href="https://t.co/3HxIRCeJ92">pic.twitter.com/3HxIRCeJ92</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1940384398966157800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>If you buy the updated Super Citizen Edition or Super Citizen Edition upgrade following this switch in August, you'll be given the Warbond Token when you next log into the game. To check it's there, hover over any warbonds you've not bought in the store and see if a "Claim Premium Warbond" button pops up. Arrowhead say there are no plans to sell tokens as standalone DLC at the moment.</p>
<p>So, there you go. No more accidentally ending up in a 2warbonds situation that leaves you 2furious, just because you were desperate to make sure you own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">every cape</a> in the cosmos.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-super-citizen-edition-is-being-updated-to-stop-folks-accidentally-buying-the-same-warbond-twice]]></content:encoded>
