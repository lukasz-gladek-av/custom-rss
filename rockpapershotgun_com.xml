            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have revealed the new gear that'll be arriving in the game with its next warbond on June 12, and there's an armour set that seems inspired by another franchise high on authoritarian satire, Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm surprised it's taken that long for one of the warbonds - which as plenty of people have pointed out often amount to giving players a way to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">look even more fascisty</a> than you do by default in Helldivers 2 - to dip into something Dredd-ish.</p>

<p>As you can see towards the end of the trailer above, this armour set  - dubbed the BP-77 Grand Juror - will become purchasable from the game's superstore once this latest warbond goes live. There's a cape, pistol and player card to go with it, if you want to complete the look.</p>
<p>It's interesting, if understandable given how many HD2 players have been clamouring to dress up like Dredd, that Arrowhead's opted to sell this set separately to the similarly-themed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/05/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-launches-june-12/?sf277523410=1">Force of Law warbond</a> it's dropping the same day. Both are about looking like a militarised cop (or a regular cop, given the times we live in), after all.</p>
<p>As it stands, if you spend your Super Credits on the warbond, you'll get the usual little collection of fresh stuff all in one bundle. There are two armours - the medium BP-20 Correct Officer set and light BP-32 Jackboot set, the former of which looks to have drawn some visual cues from Robocop with the shape of its helmet's visor, potentially ticking yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">beloved satire box</a>.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there's the AR-32 Pacifier assault rifle and G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which sticks to enemies and downs them with electrical pulses. There's also the AX/ARC-3 'Guard Dog' K-9 stratagem, which is basically a gun taped to a drone that follows you around and makes sure an enemy doesn't lay down the law on your backside while you're distracted by some Super doughnuts.</p>
<p>As some of the folks on Reddit who're trying infer an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ko4aag/my_take_on_the_recent_warbonds_are_telling_a/">extra bit of story</a> from Arrowhead's warbond deployment have pointed out, it's arguably a bit weird to get military police gear just as the Galactic War's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">moved away from Super Earth's streets</a>. But hey, it's a chance to shout that you're the law as you take down some bots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
