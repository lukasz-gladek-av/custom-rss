            <p>Hark! Comments have been temporarily turned off on Rock Paper Shotgun. We and all of our sibling websites are moving to a new commenting platform and the existing comments need to be ported across. This process will take some time - days, perhaps - and we'll update this post once it's complete and commenting functionality has been restored.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In brief, we need to take a snapshot of the almost 2 million comments posted on RPS over the last seventeen years, then import them into the new system. It's better if new comments aren't being created in that time.
</p>
<p>Once comments return, you shouldn't need to do anything differently. Your login and site account will remain the same as before, but the comment section itself will have a different look and feel and probably a few different features. We'll share more details once the switchover happens.
</p>
<p>If we had been able to plan this further in advance, we would have published a series of articles containing our most controversial opinions, to take advantage of your brief inability to yell at us. But alas, it wasn't to be. Instead I'll say that I truly value the comment community here and I look forward to hearing from you all again on these pages soon. In the meantime, you can make yourself heard by <a href="mailto:graham@rockpapershotgun.com">emailing me</a> with  any thoughts, questions or feedback.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Worthless,’ they'd declared. Most NFTs were ‘worthless.’ The greatest artistic movement since The Big BSoD, the greatest proof of the power of the blockchain, the very future of the whole funging Infobahn, and the hedgie soybean-counters say it's all ‘worthless’," once wrote the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-nfts-are-worthless-how-come-i-have-written-a-third-novel-about-nfts-saving-the-future">greatest living prophet of our era</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an entirely predictable case of "I am <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/">once again </a>asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie", those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game">Ian Games</a> for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).</p>

<p>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which I won’t link because I respect the colour green too much, is “the ultimate Web3 competitive Turn-Based RPG”. You can only play the game via its own website, which I won’t link to because I respect the colour green too much. There’s also a trailer floating around. Not going to link to that either. Got a lot of respect for ‘things in motion’, I have, and this represents a terrible use of them.</p>
<p>As IGN point out, Ubisoft first announced it’d be sticking its head in the NFToilet bowl and daintily sampling the yellowing side-cruft about three years back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">in an earnings call</a>. Words like ‘revolution’ were used. The phrase ‘play-to-earn’ was latched on to with glee. "[Blockchain] will imply more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot," chirpy cockney urchin Yves Guillemot said at the time.</p><p>Contrast this to statements made by Ubisoft’s Philippe Tremblay to<a href="http://gi.biz/"> GI.biz earlier this year</a>, where the director of subscriptions said that a consumer shift "needs to happen" re: "Gamers are used to owning their games". Sure, blockchain and subscription-based access are different kettles of fish, but this does feel inconsistent. It’s almost like they’ll just say anything! Why even use words anymore! Why not just chortle and snort! You know you want to!</p>
<p>If you slept through or somehow mercifully forgot about the crypto craze of the last few years, you might be wondering why a game that lets you buy items as NFTs is a problem. First up, there’s the obvious pay-to-win element attendant on letting people cough up to forge more powerful characters - something that irks me less because of the holy sanctity of competitive game balance (although that’s enough to put me off playing), and more because these things are designed to play off the same vulnerabilities as gambling.</p>
<p>IGN report that the highest priced figurines - the characters you use to battle - are up on the marketplace at $63k. That doesn’t mean people are necessarily paying this much, mind, and those are outliers - most bits are a mere $300. Either way, it seems antithetical to anything actually interesting or valuable about game design. Why inspire organic investment when you can just invite players to join in a ghoulish sunk-cost spiral?</p>
<p>Secondly, the web3 industry have thus far failed to make a convincing case that this stuff isn’t a complete emissions disaster. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">According to one study</a>, Bitcoin alone uses the same amount of electricity each year as Argentina. For balance, I should point out that blockchain advocates argue that the technology can aid sustainability via “more accurate load monitoring, generation, and distribution in the grid through efficient use of data,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/">via Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>It's also hard to see the release of Champions Tactics right now as anything but an act of desperation from a Ubisoft evidently feeling financial pressure, or at least trying to get those numbers up before a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">potential buyout</a>.</p>
<p>I leave you with more words of wisdom from RPS’s dearly departed scryer of crud:</p>
<p>"A crack revealing strata of vape pens, LaserDiscs, and bags for life. All of it, trash. The melted bumper of the weed-green Tesla Model X once owned by... she couldn't even say his name. Everything, trash. Two empty bottles of Irn-Bru Kombucha rising like the legs of Ozymandias. 5arah snorted. <em>Look on my apes, ye Mighty, and despair!</em>"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">can be thin</a>, but I think Indiana Jones's dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. "Nazis - I hate these guys!" he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc88_ZEfxg">Lionel Hutz</a> that quote: "Nazis? I hate <em>these</em> guys!" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.</p>
<p>I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.</p><!--more-->
<p>I saw this on the start-up screen during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-redefines-the-gun-toting-archaeologist-as-a-grabby-lucasfilm-fanboi">my hands-on with the game</a> a few weeks ago. I meant to email for a copy of the text and write it up, but I forgot, and then those chancers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/">Gamespot</a> did an article, so here I am playing Journo Come Lately. Here's the disclaimer in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a fictional story, inspired by historical events and characters. Names, characters, organizations, locations, and events are either imaginary or depicted in a fictionalized manner, not intended to disrespect any historical or cultural beliefs.</p>
<p>The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's likely just the usual legal arse-covering, of course. The game itself might be bruisingly frank about the fash, but there's nothing to stop an opportunistic far-right chowderhead cherry-picking a screenshot or video for the sake of a meme, or modding the game to let you play as the goose-steppers.</p><p>It's also possible the disclaimer is designed to ensure compliance with Germany's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/germany-lifted-its-ban-on-nazi-imagery-in-video-games-thats-great.html">qualified lifting of prohibitions on depictions of Nazis in video games back in 2018</a>, following which "symbols of unconstitutional organisations can be used in games in individual cases, as long as those symbols serve an artistic or scientific purpose, or depict current or historical events."</p>
<p>Still, it does look a bit ridiculous. This is Indiana Jones! I'm curious about whether the developers have any internal guidance about how to avoid counter-intuitively glorifying Nazis while teaching you to beat them to death. I guess you could argue that Indiana Jones And The Great Circle might inadvertently build a little sympathy given that it is basically a Third Reich Bullying Simulator.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
