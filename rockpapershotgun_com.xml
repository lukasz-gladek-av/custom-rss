            <p>Sponge away the dross and ephemera of my life and you're left with a series of moments in which I wonder: is <em>now</em> the right time to get into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-heroes">Legend of Heroes</a>? I've been planning to play Nihon Falcom's 17-part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series ever since a respected peer gently suggested that my enthusiasm for Final Fantasy and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> marked me out as a Basic Bitch, and that if I ever want to experience a <em>real</em> role-playing game, I should give LoH a go.

<p>
I am held back by a number of things: 1) the Legend Of Heroes games are mega-normous, possibly 2) because they're meandering and overstuffed, for all their quality, and 3) nobody I've spoken to can agree on which I should start with. I did have a breakthrough recently, coming to the conclusion that I should get the ball rolling with The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, the sixth game from 2004 - it's the one I see most often in GOAT threads, and the first in a distinct subseries. But now Nihon Falcom have ruined everything by plotting to remake it. Titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</a>, the remake will launch on 19th September (as revealed in Famitsu, via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19">Gematsu</a>). Here's the most recent trailer.

If you're familiar with Trails In The Sky, the key differences here are: new HD visuals, new voiceovers, and "the choice of traditional turn-based combat or all-new, real-time action combat", as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/">the Steam page</a>. Great: not only do I now have to decide whether to play the original game or the remake first, I also now have to pick between old and new flavours of battling. Why do you vex me, Nihon Falcom.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I consistently hear about the Trails games is that the NPC and world writing are absolutely excellent: generous to the point of exhausting, with every NPC worth returning to. If you've played it, please do not leave a comment expounding upon these or any other virtues. It will only add to my choice paralysis. I've read that anger freezes into depression if left unexpressed. Is there a point where FOMO metamorphs into a full-on midlife crisis?
