            <p>Netflix’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-including-the-developers-of-batman-arkham-mortal-kombat-and-mad-max">$82.7 billion proposal</a> to buy the parts of Warner Bros Discovery that include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> creators Avalanche, Lego devs TT Games, Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm and Batman Arkham outfit Rocksteady has… fallen through.</p>
<p>Rival moneymonster Paramount Skydance has swept in with an even larger bid, submitted 24th February. They’re offering around $111 billion - $31 per share - for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery, including its linear cable channels. </p>
<p>“That’s a lot of zeros!” I bawl, slamming my face into my eroded laptop keyboard as I contemplate my landlord’s proposal to raise the rent yet again, even though he hasn’t sorted all the mold growing behind the fixed wardrobe. When is somebody going to propose to buy me for a hundred billion dollars??? I’ve still got all my own teeth.</p>
<p>Warner Bros Discovery’s board had previously rejected an all-cash, $30 per share offer from Paramount Skydance for the whole company, but Paramount came back to the table with a higher bid earlier this month. </p>
<p>Netflix have declined to raise their own bid, despite having a few business days left to fight back. As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/netflix-declines-raise-bid-warner-bros-discovery-1236674149/">Variety</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was in Washington, D.C. earlier Thursday in an effort to lobby Trump administration officials on the deal. </p><p>Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison and his dad Larry Ellison - who is funding the acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery out of his personal fortune - are themselves prominent supporters of Donald Trump, and have flaunted this connection as reassurance that their acquisition will make it through regulation. There have also been efforts on the US right to portray the Netflix acquisition as <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-warner-bros-maga-1236702805/">a leftwing takeover</a> (Warner own CNN, one of Trump’s favourite bogeymen; Netflix have published ‘progressive’ media like the Obama-backed documentary American Factory). </p>
<p>Naturally, the Democrat opposition in the US view the proposed Paramount-Warner merger with suspicion: as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/paramount-netflix-senate-judiciary-antitrust-1236738054/">Deadline</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/netflix-isnt-going-to-buy-warner-bros-after-all-meaning-paramount-is-set-to-take-hbo-warner-bros-games-and-the-rest/">PCGamer</a>, Democrat senator and Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee ranking member Cory Booker has invited David Ellison to testify in court.</p>
<p>In backtracking on the merger agreement, Warner Bros Discovery will have to cough up a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix, but Paramount have said they’ll cover this - in addition to offering a $7 billion breakup fee in the event that regulators shoot their own acquisition down.</p>
<p>"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US," Netflix’s higher-ups have said in a statement. "But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price."</p><p>Assuming <em>this</em> acquisition goes through, the immediate impact of the merger will likely be felt by TV and film studios working under Warner and Paramount. These are established ‘legacy media’ companies and there’s a lot of overlap, which probably means we can expect layoffs. It’s less clear how Warner’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">already much-reduced game division</a> will be impacted.</p>

            <p>If you've ever thought it'd be cool to wander <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s version of medieval Europe with some mates, who might make your adventuring life easier by being slightly better at navigating the social waters of feudalism and swordfighting in a fashion that isn't just a blockless flailing of limbs, I bring good news. A group of modders have started work on a multiplayer mod for Warhorse's RPG, with an experimental version already available to give a go.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/modders-are-teaming-up-to-make-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-multiplayer-a-reality-with-visions-for-pvp-and-gta-style-rp-and-theres-an-early-playable-version-already/">GamesRadar</a>, a Polish modder going by Michal and the Reddit handle Ddesoo <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1r76m1y/kcd2_i_made_a_poc_online_mod_still_looks_like/">started posting</a> about their work on this KCD2 online mod last week. They look to have made some rapid progress in that time, while recruiting some folks with more modding experience to their cause.</p>
<p>Their initial build quickly evolved into a basic framework which allows two players to join a server together and see each other in-game as "ghost" NPCs which have synced up movement. These NPCs are growing less ghostly by the day, with the latest revision allowing them to equip proper armour and weapons, as well as cast shadows.</p> 
<p>If you fancy giving this early "experimental" iteration a go or having a look at its makeup, Michal and co have put it live on <a href="https://github.com/marczukmichal/kcd2-multiplayer/tree/feat-net">Github</a>, as well as setting up a <a href="https://discord.gg/FQVCXgH74N">Discord server</a>. You'll need a legit copy of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and to grab the game's <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/modding-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">official modding tools</a> via Steam.</p><p>While the modders have mentioned having some lofty long-term goals like PvP and GTA-esque roleplaying servers, it could take a while for their creation to get anywhere near those, since it's currently only at the proof-of-concept stage. As a couple of Reddit commenters have noted, getting over these initial hurdles often isn't the biggest challenge faced by ambitious modding projects like this - that lies in rounding everything into a shape which works consistently and reliably during the longer sessions players will want to be able to delve into uninterrupted.</p>
<p>For now, though Michal and co certainly look to be making promising early steps towards their Henry cloning goals. Maybe in a few years time I'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">hop in with Edwin</a> and show him just how crap I am at defending myself when I inevitably piss off both the lords and serfs of some pleasant little town.</p>

            <p>Mere hours after releasing their newest GeForce Game Ready <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPU</a> driver, 595.59 WHQL, Nvidia have recalled it, amid <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/582871/geforce-grd-59559-feedback-thread-released-22626/">widespread reports</a> of the update interfering with the cooling fans, core clock speeds, and even general game performance of users’ RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>The driver’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/resident-evil-requiem-geforce-game-ready-driver/">announcement post</a>, which still boasts of readying PCs for today’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launch, now carries an added warning: "We have discovered a bug in the Game Ready and Studio 595.59 WHQL drivers and have removed the downloads temporarily while our team investigates. For users that have already installed this driver and are experiencing issues with fan control, please roll back to 591.86 WHQL."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-unlaunches-its-geforce-595-59-driver-after-reports-of-fan-and-clock-issues">VideoCardz</a>, with a z, fan issue complaints seem the most prevalent. The 595.59 driver doesn’t exactly cause fans to spin off their mounts and fling themselves into the owner’s neck like a Ravenholm sawblade, but it is allegedly messing with the sensors that inform fans how hard and fast they need to spin to keep their GPU cool. That could potentially lead to overheating and a busted graphics card – a particularly unpleasant prospect when replacements have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-hardware-makers-zotac-warn-memory-shortages-raise-concerns-about-the-very-survival-of-graphics-card-manufacturers">made even more expensive by memory chip shortages</a>.</p>
<p>Other technical woes blamed on 595.59 range from unduly limited boost clock speeds on RTX 50 series models, crashes, and lowered performance in Unreal Engine 5 games. Yep, that’s a rollback sitch indeed. For what it’s worth, I’ve been playing (and did all my desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-pc-performance-best-settings">performance testing</a> for) Resi Requiem on the previous 591.86 driver, and didn’t have any problems at all. Not that there’s much of a choice, now that the newer version has been pulled, but is the potential for very, very, very slightly better-shaded flop fringes worth the risk of inflicting heatstroke on your PC’s priciest component? It is a very impressive fringe. But no.</p>
