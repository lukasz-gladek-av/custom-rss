There is perhaps no better thing for a game to have than other, inconsequential things that have no real relation to the main thing for you to do that are entirely focused on mucking about. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> is ostensibly about reaching the top of a mountain all for the sake of a sweet chance of escape, but really it is about doing silly things with, to, or around your friends. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752?l=english">new update</a> has arrived in the game that is, to use the word ostensibly again because I couldn't think of another one, ostensibly about rebindable controls, but here too it's really about doing silly things with friends, things that don't even involve any climbing.
</p>
<p>
Basketball! This is one such way you can pass your time before heading out on your next misadventure. The devs say they "even made it dribble," which I do believe is quite important in this particular sport, I can't be sure, America hasn't successfully forced this pastime onto the UK like it has every other aspect of its culture. There's also chess, a game which I feel in my gut is somehow the spiritual inverse of Peak, but don't have the words to accurately describe this just yet.
</p>
<p>
On the cuter end of things, there's a photobooth in the airport now too, complete with non-functional, prop versions of the game's various items to take pictures with. Oh, and Bing Bong - you've met Bing Bong, right? Great guy, great guy - will now give you a yes-or-no answer after giving him a good squeeze, say for example if you were to ask him if it's a good idea to leap to your death or not. Love ya Bing Bong!
</p>
<p>
There is another big biome update on the way, this was mostly an update to get rebindable controls in (which are exactly what they sound like) with a few extras thrown on top.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up Peak with its new update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have once again addressed the range of performance issues that've come to afflict the shooter, teasing a mid-October update that they reckon should deliver a "noticeable improvement" and outlining that wider plans are in the works in terms of dealing with some larger problems.</p>
<p>Problems with Helldivers 2's stability and general bugginess of the bad kind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">rose to prominence again following last month's Into the Unjust update</a>. Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">quick to admit that the game's performance was "not good enough"</a>, citing "crippling" technical debt as being st the root of some of the more deep-seated issues. At the time, he said the studio would likely prefer not to put out an update focused only on performance fixes unless it was totally necessary, but it appears that might have been deemed to be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs...We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us," reads a tweet attributed to the entire Arrowhead team.
</p>
<p>They go on to tease an update they're aiming to release "mid October-ish", which they reckon "will make a noticeable improvement" in the short-term. As to which problems it'll target/fixes it'll include, the studio listed the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some key crash fixes</li>
<li>Fixed the Primary weapon/Side-arm audio that stops during a mission</li>
<li>Minor performance improvements</li>
<li>Long overdue bug fixes, like Charger footstep sounds (pretty useful) or weapon audio stopping mid mission</li>
<li>No more landing on caves</li>
<li>A Balance Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, Arrowhead wrote: "For some of the bigger performances pieces unfortunately we can’t wave a ‘short-turnaround-magic-wand’, nor would a 60 day patch fix them fully (rather it would be duct tape where we need to solder); so we’re working on a bigger development plan as to how we can address some of the larger concerns."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs.</p><p>We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right…</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1970845182674215225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>They closed out by promising more communication and transparency with players going forwards, something that's long been a bit of an achilles heel in the otherwise admirable job the studio have done in terms of working to sustain their live-service about super service. We'll see if they're finally able to get on top of it this time, possibly by bringing in more folks to help out a community team that from what I've seen already do an awful lot in terms of answering questions and addressing concerns on the game's very active Discord. The issue's generally been the comms which goes beyond that sector of the playerbase, with responses on Discord regularly having to be reposted elsewhere to get word out.</p>
<p>Arrowhead have their hands full from the perspective of new additions to the game too at the moment. They recently had to commit to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">turning off a new strain of Terminids</a> for just over a month in an effort to fix issues with the burrowing bugs.</p>

            <p>Steam's latest client beta has given you another way to quickly check whether you've got secure boot enabled before you hop into some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>sing about. Enabling the setting's become mandatory for the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, as the possibly futile war on cheating continues to rage like, er, well, you know.</p>
<p>It's a controversial way of going about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">trying to limit the amout of fraudulent 360 no-scopes</a>, as it involves publishers mandating an aspect of how players' hardware's used, if a pretty easy one to check with a trip to your BIOS if you know what you're doing. Not everyone's used to delving into those settings though, which is why it's nice Valve have made this useful addition to their game playing place.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545621427784515587">brief post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-now-lets-you-check-if-you-have-secure-boot-enabled-the-security-feature-were-all-going-to-have-to-get-to-grips-with-for-battlefield-call-of-duty-and-more/">Pretty Cold Grandma</a>, a Steam client beta update deployed early this morning has brought in this tweak.</p>
<p>To use it to check if you've got secure boot enabled, you'll first need to opt into the latest client beta if you haven't already. On desktop, that's done by heading to the Steam logo in the top left when you open up Steam, then selecting 'Settings' from the drop-down menu. From there, you go to 'Interface', 'Steam Client Beta Participation', and select 'Steam Beta Update' from the drop-down menu to the right of the latter. A restart of Steam'll be required, then once it loads back up, you can head to 'Help' in the top left, select 'System Information' from the drop-down.</p><p>You'll get a list of info about your PC, and in the bit about your operating system, you'll find a line which specifies whether or not secure boot is enabled. Just below that's a line listing your Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version, this being a processor that allows your PC to carry out cryptographic operations with some added security measures. It's generally a requirement to get secure boot up and running.</p>

<p>We'll see if these measures ever manage to do more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">continue to move the goalposts those keen to cheat will likely just find another way to auto-aim their bullets through</a>. At least if the amount of time/energy it takes to check if secure boot's enabled can be minimised, with the added bonus of making it easier for the less tech-savvy, that's something positive.</p>
