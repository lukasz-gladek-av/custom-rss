        <p>They're selling your Horace hat as we speak</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Details from 89 million Steam accounts have reportedly gone up for sale on the dark web. Since RPS's dedicated tech team have just informed me that the dark web is not the thing you get when you click 'incognito tab' and is actually potentially much scarier than that, you might want to consider changing your password. Or maybe not. As I say, it's all alleged at this point.</p>

<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> by user Underdark.AI, listed as a "Computer and Network Security" page, as reported on by our network chums <a href="https://www.vg247.com/steam-vendor-data-breach-passwords-89-million-users-dark-web">at VG247</a>. From the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, a threat actor going by Machine1337 posted on a well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam, offering a dataset of over 89 million user records for $5,000. The post includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Telegram contact for purchase</li>
<li>A link to sample data hosted on Gofile</li>
<li>Mentions of internal vendor data, indicating deeper access</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>They later updated the post with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following our initial post on the claimed Steam data breach (89M+ users), new evidence confirms that a leaked sample contains real-time 2FA SMS logs routed via Twilio.</p>
<p>The data includes message contents, delivery status, metadata, and routing costs — suggesting backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.</p>
<p>This reinforces a supply chain compromise, putting user security at risk via phishing or session hijacking.</p></blockquote>
<p>X user Mellow_Online, who shared the news on that platform, says that <a href="https://x.com/MellowOnline1/status/1922458722485317664">they were contacted by a Valve representative</a> who "stated that they do not use Trillio", the data protection company mentioned in the LinkedIn post.</p>
<p>Data security is very far out of my wheelhouse - I still think it's funny to say "I'm in" in a hacker voice whenever a website loads after being slow for a bit - so I'm not to going to add additional comment (though I have asked Valve for one). Do with this information what you will!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The founder of gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers has been accused of abuse and financial mismanagement. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">Speaking to IGN</a>, former employees who worked at AbleGamers alleged multiple instances of sexist and emotionally abusive behavior, financial mismanagement, as well as aggressive, racist, and inappropriate remarks by founder Mark Barlet. Barlet denies the allegations.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After allegedly being told by Barlet that she was effectively the company's HR because she was the only woman that worked there, one source was sent to work on an HR case. This "was really illegal of me because I didn’t have those credentials," she told IGN. Barlet reportedly made light of this situation for several weeks afterward, "causing numerous employees to feel uncomfortable". Following childbirth, the same woman was told by Barlet in a meeting that her "jugs had gotten so big that he wouldn’t know how to handle them".</p>
<p>The source also described hearing Barlet make racist remarks about other employees. In one instance, Barlet reportedly said that "we need to get the most fucked up disabled person to be on our marketing, the one with real multiple disabilities," while making mocking gestures. The source told IGN that Barlet's "behaviors with her grew increasingly hostile every time she spoke out against him". Barlet also was reportedly dismissive or aggressive towards other accessibility advocates, telling one individual over a call that they were "a drop in the pond of accessibility. And I own the pond".</p>
<p>According to another anonymous source, Barlet also mismanaged funds from the millions in donations the charity recieved over the years. "Funds were allocated for first-class tickets for certain leadership, hotel rooms before or after the dates of designated events, and even expensive meals for office staff that primarily consisted of remote employees," write IGN. The same source alleges that Barlet also used the nonprofit's budget to pay for a Tesla charger for AbleGamers's headquarters, despite being the only one there who drove a Tesla. Salaries were also a point of contention with the nonprofit, with alleged favouritism dictating pay, and "some employees earning far more for doing far less within the company".</p>
<p>This all came to a head in April last year, when a former employee ordered an investigation by payroll and HR service ADP, who allegedly advised AbleGamer's independent board to terminate Barlet "immediately due to the severe nature of the allegations," write IGN. The independent board allegedly ignored ADP's findings. Barlet eventually left the nonprofit following another external investigation.</p>
<p>When reached out to by IGN for comment, Barlet said that "after thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," telling IGN that the allegations and subsequent investigation occured after he was allegedly advised to cut back on AbleGamers' workforce. He also responded to the claims of financial mismanagement, denying the Tesla charger purchase and several other allegations. IGN note that Barlet provided "no evidence to refute the allegations, only his word", and refused to show documentation unless correspondence was off the record.</p>
<p>A source who spoke to IGN alleges that those who spoke out against Barlet were retaliated against by the board. "The people that were fired were all ones that filed reports or talked to lawyers." AbleGamers officials did not respond to IGN's request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-adds-new-cars-and-muddy-tracks-with-more-planned-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Speedy fender-bender 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> has added two new cars to its roster of smashmobiles alongside two new tracks, including one track from the first game that's been given a "makeover". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a> is still in earliest of access, so this only brings the total number of vehicles up to six, and the selection of tracks is still limited too. But it's the start of what developers Bugbear see as steady progress, with more cars and courses set to come next month.</p>

<p>The new cars include a European sports sedan called the Bravion and a familiar American longbrute called Rammer, which featured in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> as a reliable early career car. I certainly drove it into the ground anyway. The tracks, meanwhile, offer the fresh dirt of central European rallycross, and the return of Finncross, a track from the previous game which has been spruced up. </p>
<p>"It has been given a complete makeover so it's okay if you don't even recognize it," say the developers in the above trailer. "It’s a track packed with tight turns, perfect for corner bombing
so we except to see some epic battles this time too."</p>
<p>Along with these headliners, there's also a bunch of smaller updates and changes. The gamepad now rumbles, the user interface has been improved, and you can now properly invite buds to join a server from your Steam friends list. There's a small mound of performance tweaks and bug fixes too, all of which are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/501698646945826538">an update post</a> on Steam. That's also where the developers promise more bangers and raceplaces soon, with a roadmap showing that another update of similar size is planned for next month. </p>
<p>That's encouraging. Wreckfest 2 feels nice and weighty in the hands yet is quite light on actual toys to play with so far. You can read my impressions in more detail in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-review">early access review</a> but basically it's gearing up to be a solid and exciting sequel to a respected game of windshield-cracking antics. More stuff is good stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
