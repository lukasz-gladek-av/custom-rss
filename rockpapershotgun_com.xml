There isn't a huge list of things that'll immediately sell me on your game, but there is one that'll draw me in without fail pretty much every single time: you can drive around in a kei truck. Now, admittedly, there are very few games where you can actually do this, the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> being the most recent one. There's the yet to be released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2961860/Honcho/">Honcho</a> from the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/landlords-super">Landlord's Super</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a>, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/easy-delivery-co">Easy Delivery Co.</a>, a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Easy Delivery Co., you are an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> by way of PS1 game-esque cat character, who drives around a kei truck in a snowy mountainside town delivering different things. That indie PS1 aesthetic can obviously feel a bit overdone in some cases now, but Easy Delivery Co. just looks right, a bit dreary, a bit lonely even, yet with a hint of goofiness about it. Good stuff!

<p>
The game's Steam page notes that there's "definitely no secrets", which between you and me I think might just be a lie. Apparently the soundtrack is made up of lo-fi, drum 'n' bass, and jungle tracks, a real late '90s, early 2000s arcade racer vibe it seems. Oh, and there's a four-player split-screen co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> mode too? Dang, this game was just made to be played on a CRT, something I'll be doing as soon as I'm able to.
</p>
<p>
According to a press release developer Sam C is inspired by games like Animal Crossing, but also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a>, a pairing of games I would never think to make in my life, except here I am craving just that. No release date in sight for Easy Delivery Co. bar "later this year", so in the meantime you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>, and check out its demo too!

I'm sure like me, some of you would really like another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game. A Nier 3, if you will, except I won't, because it already came out and it was called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. Unfortunately it was also a free-to-play mobile game, and as most mobile games are destined for, it shut down last year rendering it completely unplayable. Nier celebrated its 15th anniversary this year, so far with no big announcements, though there is a new website that's slowly sharing bits of a special novel. And curiously enough, it appears to be teasing something Nier Reincarnation related.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k">journalist Willa Rowe</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update">IGN</a>), the website is doing something a bit odd. At the end of the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/">most recently released chapter</a>, there's some kind of computer log, a cryptic bit of text that specifically references the official Japanese website for Nier Reincarnation. In fact the specific wording leading up to the link to said website says "recovery protocol initialised."
</p>
<p>
There's even some lore stuff teased when you right click and view page source, referencing characters called Her and Him that appeared in Reincarnation, as well as a reference to The Cage, the main setting of the game. It's all a bit odd, suitably Yoko Taro, and of course has me and everyone else hoping that this is suggesting some kind of Nier Reincarnation re-release/ port is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Here's the thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>: I'd really like it if you did that. I didn't manage to catch up to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> main story in time, and even if I put all of the combat stuff on autopilot it's just not the same watching cutscene compilations on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
We can only assume that some kind of Nier project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/big-cool-weirdo-yoko-taro-may-or-may-not-be-working-on-something-that-may-or-may-not-be-nier">will be coming, some time, eventually, maybe</a>, though it would be nice for an actual bit of news. Or, like, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier Automata</a> re-release with an equally annoying name to write as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant ver. 1.22</a> blah blah blah's that adds a lore critical sword or whatever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-start-ringing-the-new-skates-death-knell-because-ea-says-its-online-only<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I think to properly convey my severe dislike of always online games I'd probably need more space and time than what an average RPS news article provides, but I'll try to contain myself on this one. You see, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA's</a> just started up this new thing it calls <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one?isLocalized=true">The Grind</a> (like what you do on a skateboard, get it?), which they describe as their "platform to talk directly to you, the community." The first volume had quite a few questions from expectant skaters about the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> reboot, one of the first being whether or not it'll have an offline mode. Can you already guess from my tone so far that it won't?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Because, as EA put it, "the simple answer" is "no." They go on to explain that the "game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities." According to EA, this isn't possible without a live connection, which I'm sure might actually have a technical justification, it just stinks a bit.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that they want to Fortnite-ify Skate so that the city can change in substantial ways, which is a cool concept! It just also means you're eventually bound to get situations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> where the game is just unplayable (which has resulted in a lawsuit, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-2-is-getting-an-offline-mode-play-test-and-it-unsurprisingly-wont-have-all-of-its-online-features">offline modes for The Crew 2 and Motorfest</a>). Maybe EA will add in an offline mode eventually so that the game will last longer than the live service fad, but I won't put any bets on it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other, less annoying details, EA do still plan to launch Skate into early access some time in 2025 at least. They also clarified that "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash," if you're someone that likes your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play games</a> to be completely free. New areas won't be paywalled either, and there's no sort of pay-to-win element. Still don't like the online-only stuff, but all of that sounds good at least.

The thing about computers is that they're just really annoying, actually. They're massively complicated, constantly changing machines, and despite the fact the hardware is technically better now, they can sometimes struggle to run older games because of… reasons. Those reasons often being software issues I won't even attempt to understand. So, it always brings a smile to my face when I see another game back from the dead through the efforts of GOG's preservation program, the most recent entry being the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breath-of-fire-iv">Breath of Fire 4</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You see, Breath of Fire 4 did actually have a PC release way back in the day. It was originally released for the PS1 back in 2000, later coming to PC in 2003, though only for Japan and Europe. As mentioned, the problem with older PC games is that they don't always work on modern hardware, and ignoring that it can be tough to track down legitimate copies of certain games. With <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 joining GOG's preservation program</a> however, it's now playable on Windows 10 and 11.

<p>
Outside of that, there's a few new display options like a windowed mode, V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing, and refined gamma correction for better visuals, alongside an upgrade to the audio engine. That one has brought back some previously missing environmental sounds, and you'll have a few options to tinker around with now too. Plus, it being GOG, the game is DRM-free, so if you decide to pick it up it's yours forever.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 isn't the only game to be spruced up either, there's other classics like Ultima Underworld 1+2, Worms: Armageddon, and Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon. Good stuff! Looking forward to whatever the GOG preservation program brings back next.

            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

<p>
The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.
