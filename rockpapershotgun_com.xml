            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-drops-next-month-brings-back-a-beloved-dark-souls-bumkicker">Forsaken Hollows expansion</a> arrives tomorrow, December 4th. Ahead of letting folks dive into Limveld's big hole and try out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-first-new-class-looks-great-for-book-nerds-and-grubby-old-men-lovers">new nightfarer classes</a>, FromSoft have lobbed out the customary big patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This patch, 1.03, is out now and decently beefy. Looking through the notes, the studio have taken the opportunity to add a a fair amount of new features, with most being minor tweaks which make certain menus easier to parse, allow you to quickly check which relics you're rocking or how many flasks you've got left, and ensure personal objectives don't impede teaming-up. Some shop inventories have also been rearranged or added to.</p>
<p>Arguably the most noteworthy thing about the patch is that FromSoft have opted not to make nightfarer-specific tweaks as part of their latest round of balancing. Instead, stock changes to passive, special and relic effects have been drafted in, with melee attacks made more powerful, while dashing and rolling strikes have also been boosted. Meanwhile, effects that help negate damage when you're already at low health have been made less effective, which is bad news for less tanky builds.</p>
<p>Given the Forsaken Hollows is supposed to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">slightly tougher cookie than the base game</a> anyway, you may want to go back to an old fashioned 'hit everyything with a big stick while cowering behind a tonne of armour plating' type of setup if you're keen to maximise your chances of not being forsakenly hollowed out.</p><p>Rounding out the patch are the usual bug fixes. FromSoft having "mitigated an issue where Sites of Grace or Churches would not activate and leveling up and adding charges to flask could not be performed under some conditions" is a welcome one. As is the rectifying of healing and enhancing effects not applying themselves to allies who happen to be busy dodging or unleashing their ultimate art.</p>
<p>You can check out the full notes rundown for the patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103">here</a>. The Forsaken Hollows is set to release on PC at 11PM GMT today, December 3rd. That's 6PM EST and 3PM PST.</p>

            <p>Valve’s quiet bankrolling of open-source emulation tools could make it heaps easier to play your PC games library on a humble smartphone, though it sounds like Gabe-made SteamOS phones are unlikely to be joining the company’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">growing hardware catalogue</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed that they’ve been funding the development of Fex – a free compatibility tool that gets Windows apps functioning on mobile ARM processors – since well before revealing the ARM-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve's bundling Fex into SteamOS so the Frame, due in 2026, can run Steam games straight off the headset’s internal chip. But it is already out in the wild right now – i.e. <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">GitHub</a> –, and has a promising future in bringing those very same games to Android phones. Just not, Griffais says, phones with a Steam logo on them.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if that’s going to be a big focus for us to develop local content or try to develop SteamOS for devices like that" he explains. "I mean, I’m not discounting any possibility, but I think with just living room, handheld, and desktop, trying to have a good outcome for gaming applications and everything else you’d want to do in a desktop, we have a ton of work to do."</p>
<p>The living room and handheld formats clearly refer to, respectively, the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> and the existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. But these are both based on x86 processors, much like a regular Windows PC or laptop. It’s ARM hardware, the diesel to x86’s unleaded, that Fex and the Frame are trying to crack – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-just-works-valve-talk-the-steam-frame-android-games-on-steamos-and-putting-a-pc-on-your-face">with at least some success</a>, judging by the slickness with which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> ran on the Frame when I tried it at Valve’s offices last month.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Steam phone or no, Fex may fulfil that promise of Steam games on mobile. It is, for instance, one of multiple x86 emulation layers employed by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame&amp;hl=en_GB">Gamehub</a>, an Android game launcher app produced by Chinese peripheral makers GameSir. I’ve tried this on my Pixel 9 and admittedly haven’t had much luck, even with the games I know work well on the Steam Frame: Hades 2 crashes immediately and Silksong gets stuck on an endless launching screen. Also, there’s a non-zero possibility that I’ve handed over my Gmail and Steam account details to the Chinese Communist Party. C'est la vie. You <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamehub">don’t have to look far</a>, mind, for folks who’ve used Gamehub to get Androidified Steam games up and running, including the author of that Verge piece.</p><p>Hopefully this cross-device compatibility push continues apace; Valve obviously have a business interest in getting Steam games (uhhhh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">sorry Horses</a>) playable on as many computery doohickeys as possible, but kicking down compatibility barriers and spreading software across devices of the user’s choosing is good for the common gamesplayer as well.</p>

            <p>
A few weeks ago, developers Beeswax Games released a "spiritual successor" to 2019 freeware game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-players-online">No Players Online</a> on Steam. If you've not played the old freeware project - <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic">still available on Itch</a> - it's one of those haunted software jobbies that accentuate the eerieness of elderly 3D simulation tech, and in this case, abandoned FPS multiplayer maps. I was looking forward to playing the successor. But then, spookily, the Steam page vanished. And now, spookily, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">it's back</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Beeswax, the game was hit by a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim filed by a "former friend" who "claimed to be co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it". Valve then took the game down on 13th November, a week after release. The developers filed a counter-notice, and Valve have now reinstated the Steam release after the complainant neglected to respond to that counter-notice in time.
</p>
<p>
You can read developer Adam Pype's full account of events <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">here</a>. It doesn't name the "former friend", and I'm not going to speculate about their identity. Pype says the upheaval has cost the project dearly, writing that "we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend."
</p>
<p>
Pype continues that "this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we're unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins."
</p><p>
I haven't been keeping up with latest happenings in DMCA-land, but this particular legal institution has attracted much criticism for being easy to abuse. Back in 2017, Alice O (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/river-city-ransom-underground-pulled-from-sale-following-copyright-claims">reported</a> on the yoinking from sale of River City Ransom Underground, commenting that DMCA filings "don't require that the accuser offer proof that they hold the rights, putting the burden of time and effort (and sometimes money) on the accused". More recently in 2023, a community guide writer had ace city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-is-back-on-steam-after-a-dmca-strike-from-disgruntled-player">removed from Steam for a month or so</a>, after developers 3Division added a mode that seemingly took a little inspiration from the writer's work.
</p>
<p>
Natalie Clayton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-players-online-offers-free-spooks-on-the-empty-servers-of-a-dead-multiplayer-game">had a rare old time</a> with No Players Online back in 2019. "No Players Online sees me, booting up old games, looking for that sweet nostalgia kick, and suggests that maybe I let dead things stay buried," she wrote. These cautionary sentiments notwithstanding, I'm thankful that the spiritual successor has escaped the grave of DMCAing. It expands on the freeware game's premise with a faux-90s desktop interface and a bunch of different, presumably cursed games to download from various not-forums.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> won't be getting the final update devs Obsidian had planned for this year. Instead the studio have opted to save putting out the new game plus mode they'd planned for this autumn for a big update to make the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s first birthday in February. To make up the extra wait, the anniversary update'll be adding some mystery extra bits alongside the already announced features.</p>
<p>The autumn patch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">originally set</a> to be the third update delivered to the nature-rific blunderbuss adventure this year. The last one to arrive was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun">the summer update</a>, which aimed to round out the fighting skills of non-magic users so that wizards weren't having all of the fun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, though, the roadmap has been remapped. No autumn update shall exist, with Obsidian having <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">announced</a> that they're shifting efforts to "a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game’s release". As such, stuff like new game plus, a photo mode, and a new type of weapon will now be arriving around February 18th, having been delayed from their original slot.</p>
<p>As someone who really should get around to replaying Avowed now some time's passed, I'm pretty happy to be able to leave thinking about doing so via new game plus next year, given how packed December always is. The photo mode'll also be a cool addition, given Avowed's vibrant natural scapes are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-avowed">one of the areas</a> in which it really sung. They'll have to pry my arquebus out of my cold, dead mushroom hands to get me to try the new kind of weapon, though.</p><p>Some character customisation additions have also been pushed from this year to the anniversary update. These include the ability to switch up your appearance within the world, as well as more presets for characters and their Godlike features. The Godlike features for the uninitiated, are the mushrooms and bits of wood you can slap across your envoy's face to show that they are the mystical nature-person of legend.</p>
<p>Alongside those announced bits, Obsidian added that you can expect some surprise "additional features" that'll fleash out the anniversary update to make it the game's biggest yet. My money's on a giant mushroom you can peel off your face, then mount to fly around Eora. Or throw at enemies like a pizza-shaped fungi boomerang. Either that or some sort of Outer Worlds 2 crossover which sees the citizens of fantasyland have to fight off an invasion of corporate types whose leader <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">the writers feel a bit sorry for</a>.</p>
