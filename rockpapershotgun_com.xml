Every game has its limitations, there is only so many actions you can take, narrative threads to unspool, buttons to press. What about a game that you can only play one round of every day? A game where you "take up the sword against an NPC or another girl-esque thing irl and fight until one of you is holding the lifeless, bloodstained hand of the other." This is the description of a tiny, visceral Yuri Game Jam game called Everyday Sororicide.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Blood Machine and Snek Remilia Ketter, Everyday Sororicide is self-described as a "tragic attempt at conveying the feeling of interacting with another girl on any level beyond superficiality." It is also a game of duels, as mentioned above, to the death. A 1v1 me on Final Destination, not items kind of game, each character bequeathed a sword with which you have a handful of actions. Stab, feint, dodge, jump, slam down, it is simple, yet particular; you have to watch for an opening, the girl-esque thing in front of you won't go down easily, all while drone music blares increasingly aggressively at you.

<p>
In its solo mode, you can only play it a single time a day. That's all. It is defiant in its structure, unwilling to bend to your wants of discovering more, of learning why these women feel such desperation to fight each other, of discovering a secret you didn't know you sought after. There's a mystery here made more tantalising by its refusal to be uncovered quickly.
</p><p>
That isn't to say this is a game you can only play once a day, as it actually has a multiplayer mode in which you can do battle with a mate, or, maybe someone you have a toxic situationship with. Seems like the right kind of game for such an activity.
</p>
<p>
If you too would like to figure out how to interact with another girl, you can pick up Everyday Sororicide on <a href="https://snekofspice.itch.io/everyday-sororicide">itch.io</a> for free.

The thing about Big Business these days is that when you get Big Numbers, that normally leads to Bigger Business, right up to the point the well has not only dried up, but turned to dust. So, when you have a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, now winner of many Geoff Keighleys and seller of many copies, you might assume that developer Sandfall Interactive would increase the size of their operations. Apparently, you would be wrong!
</p>
<p>
As part of Edge's Knowledge newsletter (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/">GamesRadar</a>), director Guillaume Broche was asked about whether the studio's next project would be a "larger-scale production," to which he responded: "No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself."
</p>
<p>
He continued, "We could scale up now that we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves." Perhaps my favourite bit of the interview is where Broche says that they "love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."
</p>
<p>
Of course, it's still important to remember that discourse causing bit about the fact that Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wasn't made by just 30 people</a>, so it's not like the game was made by a teeny, tiny group of folks. Expansion may still happen, including through utilising more outsourced studios, but it's still nice to hear a company not chasing the money for once.
