            <p>
How do you follow on from making a game that essentially popularised a whole new genre? I can only imagine that question is one Brendan Greene, aka Player Unknown, i.e. the creator of PUBG, has asked himself a few times. The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, a game that has been in the works for a little while now, and at long last has an early access release date.
</p>
<p>
That date isn't too far off either: it's November 20th! And with that release date came a new trailer showing off some new features you can expect in the early access release. While the main mode of the game sees you travelling across a randomly generated wilderness towards a weather tower, there will be an option for a Free Roam mode which lets you walk about the place at a much more leisurely pace. In this mode, the only thing that can kill you is fall damage, so as long as you mind your feet you'll be all good.
</p>

<p>
The early access release will come with a bunch of customisation features too. These can get really minute too, like the amount of cabins that are spawned, how strong the airflow is, that sort of thing. You can also control the weather, allowing for blizzards, acid rain, thunderstorms, and you can control whether it's always daytime or nighttime if you like.
</p><p>
Those of you that like to get creative might be interested in the game's map editor. This one doesn't look massively involved from the trailer, but there might be more going on behind the scenes. Or, if you like playing the maps the game itself generates, you can also share the seeds of those maps with others so they can give them a go.
</p>
<p>
If you're curious about what the game is like in action, Edwin went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, and even spoke to Greene about it.

            <p>
Things aren't sounding so hot over at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developer Rockstar right now. Yesterday, a report came out from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) that a number of employees have been allegedly fired, with the UK's IWGB Game Workers Union claiming it was an act of union busting. Two-Two, Rockstar's parent company, have denied this allegation.
</p>
<p>
According to the report, alongside a post from the IWGB Game Workers Union's Bluesky account, the roles of more than 30 staffers were "terminated" across both UK and Canadian offices Thursday this week. Bloomberg notes that all of the employees were apparently a part of a private Discord group chat revolving around trade unions, with members of this group either a part of the IWGB or were currently attempting to organise at Rockstar.

Alex Marshall, president of IWGB, offered this statement: "Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."
</p><p>
Take-Two spokesman Alan Lewis claims the firings were for "gross misconduct," and for no other reason" and that "we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach." It does not appear any specifics over what said gross misconduct might have been shared.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar are no strangers to workplace controversies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-employees-decry-crunch-controversy">including those involving crunch</a>, though word on that front has been quieter in recent years.
</p>
<p>
As you'll already be aware, the studio is currently working on GTA 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">currently slated for release in 2026</a>.

            <p>
Sure looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is off to an alright start, 'ey? Success doesn't mean there's any rest for the wicked, i.e. a live service game, however. Just yesterday, only a day after launching, developer Embark Studios revealed their Arc Raiders <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025. It's light on details, but does offer a good outline for what you can expect at the very least.
</p>
<p>
In terms of ongoing additions and tweaks, Embark are working on new map conditions, feats, trials, and cosmetics, alongside some general quality of life improvements and mysteriously, "more…" for the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. November, the month we suddenly find ourselves in, looks to be quite packed with additions. There's a whole new map, Stella Montis, which will bring the game to five total. Some "special themed community events" will be held this month (and in December) too.
</p>
<p>
A couple of new Arc machines will be introduced this month, called Matriarch and Shredder respectively. I imagine it's safe to assume that that second one will be looking quite sharp. On top of that, there'll be more quests, weapons, and gadgets to pick up too.
</p>
<p>
Then in December, a snowfall map condition will be added in - no prize for you or me for making an assumption that this one does what it says on the tin. There's also something called the Flickering Flames Event, as well as just a feature titled "Expedition Departure Window." You'll also be able to make your way through a new Raider Deck, and try your hand at even more quests.
</p>
<p>
That's the long and short of it, there is of course a promise for "more" which presumably will come in the new year. You'll need to wait a while longer to find out whatever that might be.

</p>
