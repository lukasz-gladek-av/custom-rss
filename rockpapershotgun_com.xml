            <p>
Moon Beast have released a pre-alpha demo for their action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a>. You know, the one from the former Blizzard North devs, which harkens back to Diablo 2 while stirring in a dynamic world and terrain destruction reminiscent of Minecraft. I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-game-in-the-world-to-make-how-darkhaven-hopes-to-rebottle-diablo-2s-lightning-by-channelling-minecraft">a big interview feature</a> about it. Now, you can play a very early build and decide whether I've been quaffing the Kool Aid.
</p>
<p>
I spent an hour with a Darkhaven build myself last week, and while it’s got a long way to go, I did have fun. It’s very Diablo, with familiar red and blue health and mana bulbs on the left, and its own version of Blizzard’s old paperdoll character equipment screen. The moment-to-moment is as you’d expect – enemies spawn like intrusive thoughts and you slaughter them for gear, using special abilities with a cooldown.
</p>
<p>
The immediate difference is that when you get into a louder fight, you often resculpt the geography by accident. Explosive spells and heavier weapons punch out foxholes and shatter walls, though certain quest-related or otherwise vital buildings are indestructible. I had a brawl that ended with myself and 10 hobgoblins trapped in a single, flaming crater.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also tangled with one of the gameworld’s vaunted dynamic events. I touched a sarcophagus in the woods that promptly spewed necro-pollen in all directions, slowly transforming the landscape into an undead kingdom. You’ll need to curb-stomp the lich at the centre of such outbreaks, or else give over your entire map to the Stygian powers. I didn’t play long enough for that to happen, but it nagged at my mind as I explored in the other direction, beating up trees with hyperactive roots that lock you in place.

<p>
So far, I think the equippables modestly bear out Moon Beast’s promise of “bold, expressive” loot that is worth holding onto and fooling around with, rather than trading to something with higher DPS every couple of minutes. I base this claim on the fact that I can actually remember a few of the dozens of weapons I acquired, without checking screens. There was a dagger that hit fast and lit things on fire. I also found some shoes that let me walk on water, the better to avoid those uppity trees. 
</p><p>
There are weapon rarities, and you can socket gems to mod their stats. It’s a purposefully slim selection next to the myriad flimflams and boondoggles of present-day Path Of Exile and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, though this is an early build and I’m sure the complexity will layer up. Also, you’ve got a jump and dodge button, with the ability to scramble over elevated objects, which makes this a little more immediate, closer to an action-platformer at times.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, I enjoyed my first hour in Darkhaven’s WIP world more than I enjoyed my first hour in Diablo 4, but I’m still waiting for the magic to kick in. The tactical applications of map destruction feel elementary so far: it’s mostly knocking down select dungeon walls to access treasure rooms, though I did spend a while slowly digging a moat around a boulder, so that I could aggro some toxic gnomes from safety. 
</p>
<p>
Moon Beast are hoping to put together worlds in which several global calamities might intersect, forcing you to undertake mighty defensive building projects; hours later, you might wander among the ivy-bound ruins of those earthen ramparts, identifying the exact place where the horde were repulsed. I would play such a game, but the fact that there’s a Kickstarter involved makes me cautious. You could pave a road to hell with broken Kickstarter promises.
</p>
<p>Moon Beast caution that the Darkhaven demo is at once more open-ended and ricketier than a "final quality" preview build. "The goal is simple: let you get hands-on with Darkhaven’s core gameplay and direction right now, and help us pressure-test what works as we move forward," they write.</p>
<p>"Yes, you’ll see rough edges, balance will shift, some things are still placeholder, and you may hit bugs," it continues. "But! You’ll also be playing a demo that’s closer to a real pre-alpha than a tiny curated slice."</p>
<p>The demo boasts "several hours" of play, with one character class, six skills across three trees, character progression capped at level 8, and one major world event (the Lich invasion) triggered via the main questline. There's multiplayer, too, but Moon Beast say that it's "our most experimental feature" and they might take it offline for tweaks. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">Find out more on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> now has a bunch more possibilities when it comes to one of the most important fantasy RPG build archetypes, thanks to the deployment of its anniversary update. Three new character races are on offer alongside the established humans and elves, and you can arm them with a quarterstaff which caters to mages who think puny wands and books aren't quite showy enough.</p>
<p>As you might recall, some of the stuff included in this anniversary update was orignally supposed to arrive in Avowed late last year, but ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-new-game-plus-fresh-kind-of-weapon-and-photo-mode-are-now-coming-in-a-beefy-anniversary-update">delayed by Obsidian</a>.</p>

<p>The three new races you can pick from once you've installed this latest Avowed update, the full notes for which are on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/511857117305504144?l=english">Steam</a>, are dwarves, orlans, and aumaua. I'm going to assume you know what a dwarf is, but for reference orlans are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe's short, hairy and pointy-eared fellows. Aumaua are the big battlers whose skin sometimes resembles fish scales - Avowed's most memorable companion Kai is one. </p><p>If you opt to play as a dwarf, you'll benefit from an additional point to your might and constitution stats, while orlans get boosts to perception and resolve. Aumaua, meanwhile, get plus two to might, because fish Hulk smash. Personally, I think next time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-facial-mushrooms-hide-a-fantasy-romp-thats-well-worth-your-time-disagree-and-my-arquebus-awaits">hop into Avowed</a> I'll opt for one of the first two races, because the update's new weapon is perfect for an angry little ball of deadliness.</p>
<p>It's a quarterstaff, which Obsidian describe as a "bludgeoning weapon that comes complete with wand style stun finishers", making it ideal for roleplaying as a mage with an ego the size of Eora. Small person, possibly with furry ears. Big magic stick to fuel their big magic ego. The hijinks write themselves.</p>
<p>Avowed's anniversry update also brings the likes of a new game plus mode and the ability to snap some photos as your angry little ball of deadliness beats their way through the Living Lands with their big stick of spells.</p>

            <p>Amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring SSD prices</a>, slower-but-cheaper mechanical hard drives may have offered an attractive reprieve for anyone wanting to embiggen their PC storage on a – and I know it’s increasingly difficult to use this word without breaking down into desperate laugh-crying – budget. Unfortunately, that probably ain’t happening either, as leading HDD manufacturers Western Digital and Seagate have both revealed that they’ve already sold “pretty much” all of their mechanical drive stock that was allocated for 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by German tech site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WD-and-Seagate-confirm-Hard-drives-for-2026-sold-out-11178917.html">Heise</a>, the admissions (or boasts, depending how you look at it) came during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864150-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">WD</a> and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863159-seagate-technology-holdings-plc-stx-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seagate’s</a> respective earnings calls in January. WD CEO Tiang Yew Tan said that in addition to maxing out production for 2026, "robust commercial agreements" for 2027 and 2028 are already in place with major buyers, while Seagate’s CEO William Mosley claimed the company’s HDD output capacity is "fully allocated" through the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Naturally, the bulk-buying of these hard drives – which is already causing shortages and heighted prices for home PC users – is being performed by the same entities that are driving the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">SSD and RAM shortages</a>. Namely, big tech companies wanting to build and kit out enormous data centres from which to run their AI products, like those genAI tools that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game devs hate</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hooded-horse-ban-ai-generated-art-in-their-games-all-this-thing-has-done-is-made-our-lives-more-difficult">publishers are banning</a>. Cool! This industry-wide rush has, for months, been causing a DRAM chip shortage that’s managed to widely knacker PC component availability, gouge prices, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">delay Valve’s new Steam Machine</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">kill off Crucial</a>. Seems we can add hard drives to the list of casualties, a development that also spells more bad news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> prices. If mech drives aren’t available as a cheaper alternative, that’s yet more demand being piled on SSDs, which would inevitably make supplies even scarcer and ticket prices even heavier.</p>
<p>For now, at least, a quick canter through the Internet shops suggests that hard drive supplies haven’t yet dried up entirely, and they’re still cheaper than equivalent-capacity NVMe SSDs. Still, they are snared in the same pricing trap: this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Barracuda-internal-Drive-Modellnr/dp/B0BYT7BD4Y">1TB Seagate Barracuda</a> is £80 at the time of writing, but was £52 at the end of January, and £43 in December 2025. And with replacement stock having apparently been flogged to Microsoft and the like, don’t expect that to drift back down anytime soon.</p><p>I recently asked some specialist hardware manufacturers, as part of an upcoming feature, whether they’d advise PC upgrade seekers to take the money hit now or wait until things (hopefully) calm down in 2027. Responses were mostly mixed, but everyone agreed – as do I – that if you <em>can </em>keep going with your current components, SSD or HDD storage included, you probably should.</p>
