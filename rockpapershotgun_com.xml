            <p>The current custodians of the World of Darkness tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> universe are bang up for doing more video game adaptations like the troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, according to White Wolf brand marketing manager Jason Carl. In fact, they may be working on a few already, with Carl naming Mage: The Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming and the Dark Ages setting as deserving of "the Bloodlines treatment".</p>
<p>People who've been keeping up with the vamps and their video game misadventures may find that last phrase a bit rich. For clarity, I assume that by "Bloodlines treatment" Carl means "we're going to make a big 3D RPG with a lot of lore". Rather than "we're going to delay it so often it becomes a running joke, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">fire the original narrative director</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">hand it to a different studio</a> with no real track record for RPGs, then tell people it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more spiritual successor than sequel</a>". </p><!--more-->
<p>White Wolf are the official licensing and publishing entity for all World Of Darkness adaptations. They were acquired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> outfit Paradox Interactive in October 2015, and are now co-publishers for Bloodlines 2. As for the World of Darkness itself, this is a sprawling modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> fiction analogous to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which encompasses several apocalypses and several table-top RPGs.</p>
<p>While the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is by far the most famous World Of Darkness video game adaptation, there are plenty more out there - 2003 hack-and-slash Hunter: The Reckoning and, much more recently, a bunch of Werewolf games, plus some mobile projects. In a new interview with PCGamesN, Carl made no bones of White Wolf's desire to keep cranking out the spin-offs.</p>
<p>"Who says we're not already?" he joked in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/world-of-darkness-games">PCGamesN</a>. "The answer is yes. All of those supernatural creatures have their own stories to tell, and many of them are just waiting their turn and for the right story to come along.</p>
<p>"It's not just Hunter and Werewolf," Carl went on. "It's no secret that, when we set up our in-house publishing business, we've been exploring many of the other World of Darkness games that people have been waiting for and that are underdeveloped. We've got our eyes on Mage, we've got our eyes on The Dark Ages, we've got our eyes on Changeling; we're spending a lot of time thinking about these three, and other games that people have been waiting for."</p>
<p>Carl is himself a former tabletop RPG game designer, having started out at D&amp;D creators Wizards of the Coast in the 1990s. In the chat with PCGN, he was especially enthusiastic about adapting Mage, a tabletop game that first released in 1993 and is, as you may guess, all about sorcery.</p>
<p>"I have spent considerable time thinking about what Mage would look like in a new edition," he said. "The world we live in today is very different from what we imagined it would look like when the White Wolf team were building those previous editions of Mage, and I think we're all looking forward to the challenges of figuring out how Prime and Paradox work in this world, as opposed to the world we thought we were going to get."</p>
<p>I'm not that familiar with Mage, but I gather from the White Wolf wikis that <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime</a> is one of the nine spheres of magic - it "governs the raw energy of reality". While <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> "is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of the mage."</p>
<p>This certainly seems adventurous, for a magic system, in that I can't quite picture how you'd translate all that into an everyday fireball spell. How am I supposed to splat cellar rats with *checks notes* an "Odyllic Force"? My goodness, could this be an arcane institution with <em>implications for things beside combat and levelling up</em>? I am pleased by the prospect of a video game based on such wild notions. Almost as much as I am sceptical of White Wolf's big promises, given their and Paradox's handling of the "spiritual successor" to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.</p>
<p>"There's no obstacle or gatekeeping function that would prevent any of these from making it out into a videogame and getting the Bloodlines treatment," Carl concluded. "It's a question of time, resources, the right development partners, and story." I don't know, Carl. The first three of those seem like pretty significant obstacles. They seem like much the same obstacles Bloodlines 2 has been smashing its pointy chops against since 2019, in fact. Maybe at least ship your new Vampire game - due in October, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">a recent round of layoffs at developers Chinese Room</a> - before you make any bets on the rest of the World of Darkness.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-world-of-darkness-rpgs-deserve-the-bloodlines-treatment-say-white-wolf-especially-mage-the-ascension]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have reportedly cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at ZeniMax Online Studios, developers of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a>, as part of the company's wider layoffs.</p>
<p>This is according to a post from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which follows separate reports that the layoffs have seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>. It very much looks like a pool of canned projects are accumulating at MS's feet as part of these cuts, though the company are still yet to confirm anything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG was codenamed "Blackbird" and had been in development since 2018, according to Schreier. It would have been the second game ZOS has been principal developer of since their founding in 2007, the first being Elder Scrolls Online, which has received regular updates and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">expansions</a> in the decade and change since release.</p>
<p>While we've not seen or heard much about Blackbird over the years, ZeniMax Online Studios posted job applications seeking people to work on a new engine for a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-boss-says-his-devs-have-been-killing-it-confirms-the-studio-is-working-on-a-new-game-with-a-new-engine/">around 2019</a>.</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot bringing the world of The Elder Scrolls to life, and it's time for us to take those lessons and build a new AAA IP," reads a <a href="https://www.zenimaxonline.com/joinus">careers page on ZOS' website</a>. "The vision for our next game is grand in every sense of the word, and that's why we're developing a new engine to support the needs of the project and studio. Because we're in early pre-production, this is the perfect time to join us and make your mark on an incredible new project."</p>
<p>If the reports are legit, it's sad we'll never get to see what Blackbird could have evolved into. I've never really gotten that into ESO despite loving an old roll of paper, simply because I prefer Elder Scrolls as a single player game. But much like its brother from another mother <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, ESO has certainly stuck around for the long haul, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-wasnt-the-biggest-threat-to-the-elder-scrolls-online-it-was-skyrim">evolving a lot over the years</a> and establishing a loyal audience.</p>
<p>As much as the reported game cancellation sucks, though, it's obviously the people being impacted by these layoffs that really matter. "As one illustration of just how sloppy and chaotic today's mass Xbox layoff has been," Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsykj2ccls22">follow-up post</a>, "some employees at Zenimax Online Studios are now watching their Slack accounts abruptly get locked out. No message from HR, no word on whether they still have a job, just an ominous Slack deactivation."</p>

        <p>Hopefully Arrowhead's refund hotline will be a bit less jammed after August</p>

            <p>If you're prone to passing the bread at the supermarket, totally forgetting you've already got plenty at home, picking some fresh up because you probably need bread, then realising later that you now own two full loafs with the same best before date, I have good news for you. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are taking action to stop something similar happening when people buy the game's Super Citizen Edition.</p>
<p>They're replacing the Steeled Veterans warbond in this special edition with a token that you'll be able to redeem for any one of the warbonds released for the game so far. The aim is to prevent those who're already Steeled Veterans owners - via in-game purchase or by upgrading to the Super Citizen Edition - accidentally buying the war bond again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-se/games/helldivers-2/latest-news-and-updates/?blog=JN9kex2X1qlKXB8&amp;article=BpwjMPDzY2rkga1&amp;slug=warbond-token-announcement">a post</a> from Arrowhead, the warbond token will replace the Steeled Veterans warbond in the Super Citizen Edition and the associated upgrade for the standard edition. The change comes into effect on August 26th 2025.</p>
<p>"We never want players to buy things twice and not get the value of what they paid for," the studio's social media and community manager Katherine Baskin wrote. I've no doubt that's true, but the bigger reason for the change is definitely to stop Arrowhead's support team from having to keep processing an endless supply of super credit refund requests from narked players who've ended up double warbonding.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Helldivers, we’ve been listening to our community and we’re here to let you know of an upcoming update to the HELLDIVERS 2 editions.</p><p>We’re introducing the Warbond Token! It&nbsp;will allow players who purchase the HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen Edition or HELLDIVERS 2: Super Citizen… <a href="https://t.co/3HxIRCeJ92">pic.twitter.com/3HxIRCeJ92</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1940384398966157800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>If you buy the updated Super Citizen Edition or Super Citizen Edition upgrade following this switch in August, you'll be given the Warbond Token when you next log into the game. To check it's there, hover over any warbonds you've not bought in the store and see if a "Claim Premium Warbond" button pops up. Arrowhead say there are no plans to sell tokens as standalone DLC at the moment.</p>
<p>So, there you go. No more accidentally ending up in a 2warbonds situation that leaves you 2furious, just because you were desperate to make sure you own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">every cape</a> in the cosmos.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-super-citizen-edition-is-being-updated-to-stop-folks-accidentally-buying-the-same-warbond-twice]]></content:encoded>
