            <p>The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative</a>, the petition asking EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when official support runs its course</a>, hit its deadline at the end of last month looking like it'd amassed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">more than enough signatures</a>. With that phase over, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign that's vocally supported efforts like this is left to await the outcomes, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>That's given YouTuber Ross Scott, who's become the loudest voice publicising this worldwide push for action on consumer rights when it comes to these sorts of server shutdowns, a chance to take stock of how things have gone to this point. He's keen to take a break, but will first have to see how things pan out with the multiple irons Stop Killing Games and their adjacent groups have in the fire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Since the signing period is over, we're entering a phase where things like counter lobbying and political connections are most important," Scott said in a 'wrap up' video posted to his channel Accursed Farms. "Frankly, that is not my department. I know nothing about that, though some political insiders do, and they're advising the official organizers [of the EU petition]. I'm not even aware of all their plans."</p>
<p>So, that means "a whole lot of the campaign now involves waiting", though Scott did still encourage those who're keen to support it to carry on doing things like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">contacting MEPs about the issue</a>, or helping the initiative's organisers get in contact with EU admin staff if they can.</p>
<p>Looking back on the campaign's efforts and general strategy to this point, Scott reckons those behind it have done well in terms of having "maximized our chances to push back against the issue of games being destroyed on almost every front". While he acknowledged that the group's efforts in a number of countries, such as the USA and Brazil, having hit brick walls in some form or another, Scott said he believes the campaign's "done about as well as is humanly possible given the landscape."</p>

<p>"I think France, Germany, Australia, and the EU as a whole are the heavyweights in this," the YouTuber reasoned, with measures in these places all currently waiting action or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint">responses from the bodies</a> they're directed at. "As long as we get a major market prohibiting game destruction, I think we'll largely win this globally...I don't see lots of new stuff on the horizon later. I think we either win on at least one of these or if they all fail, then it's over."</p>
<p>With things now at that stage, Scott's aiming to soon take a "standby break" from his volunteering to help promote this cause, only popping up if something happens with the campaign that he thinks would benefit from his intervention.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people found out about Stop Killing Games just recently, but I've been going at it hard for over a year and a half now, and I wasn't exactly well rested prior to that," the YouTuber said, adding that he ironically hasn't "had time to play a game for close to a couple months now". Here's hoping he is able to take that proper break, while we all wait to see what the outcomes of these bits of action are.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta kicks off later this week, and EA have now painted a picture of what you can expect maps/modes-wise, as well as in terms of the changes the devs have made based on Battlefield Labs playtest feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, there's a new trailer that features yet more folks in camo running about amid booms. I'm glad to report that no helicopters, at least at a glance, look to have been harmed in the run up to this one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal last week</a>, the open beta will mainly run across two weekend-ish windows, August 9th-10th and August 14th -17th. Because big video game in 2025, there'll also be open beta early access running from August 7th into the first weekend, limited to folks who've subscribed to EA Play Pro or registered for Battlefield Labs before July 31st.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/everything-you-need-to-know-for-the-open-beta">the first weekend</a>, you'll be able to jump into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">three different maps and three different game modes</a>. Siege of Cairo will offer urban battles likely involving much crouch-walking, Liberation Peak takes you to the countryside of Tajikistan's mountains for what sounds like more open action with jet and chopper dogfight potential, and Iberian Offensive takes you back to tight streets, but this time in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The three modes for that opening weekend are conquest, breakthrough, and closed weapons breakthrough. For weekend two, the Empire State map will be wheeled out so infantryfolks can thoroughly wreck Brooklyn, with rush and squad deathmatch also arriving to make it five modes in total.</p>
<p>Lest you think EA haven't taken anything on board from those who've already dived into the game's Battlefield Labs testing, the publishers have put out a full Tweeter essay outlining how that feedback's shaped changes for the beta and beyond. For this open play specifically, they want you to give a closed weapon conquest playlist a go as part of plans to let folks "choose between closed and open weapon modes", while maps like Siege of Cairo have had several aspects revamped with an eye to ensuring the flow of murder-deathing and balance of battles is closer to the ideal.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>The sorts of Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death debates that'll still be going on around multiplayer shooters in the year 5025 have led EA to balance damage "across the weapon pool". The weapon customisation menus have also been made more clear, and signature weapons have been introduced. The latter means, for example, recon classers will get extra advantages with the sniper rifles that I assume they'll be using to 360 no-scope fools from across the map.</p>
<p>More in-depth changes for all four of the game's main classes - assault, engineer, support, and recon - are already planned and detailed in the essay, but won't be coming in until after this open beta's concluded. That means you'll have to hop into more Labs testing if you want to try something closer to the "final adaptation" of the class system <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app">ahead of release</a>.</p>
<p>Once the open beta's done, EA'll be putting out "an overview of further changes we’re making on the road towards launch", because the tweakage can never stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Imagine Tetris but played in a bottomless ocean shaft, with linked tetronimoes serving to continue your journey down that shaft, providing you keep earning enough points to play them. This is <a href="https://fourquarters.itch.io/podvodsk">Podvodsk</a>, a free game jam experiment from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> developers Four Quarters. </p>
<p>Not played Tetris? 1) you bloody liar, and 2) let me frame this differently, then. The idea here is that you're trying to construct a tapering underwater city out of random clumps of building blocks, dangled from the bottom of a miraculously unsinkable surface platform. Each building both costs points and also, earns points based on different scoring criteria, and every time you play a piece, the screen scrolls irreversibly downward.</p><!--more-->
<p>Residential blocks score points based on whether they're close to other types of building. Factory blocks like to be positioned up against the walls of the chasm, so they can mine for ore. Business centres prefer to be a few squares away from other building types - financial analysts do enjoy a bit of elbow room, especially when they're 300 fathoms under. Seaweed farms want to be close to seaweed, obviously, while scaffolding earns you nothing, but is cheap.</p>
<p>My favourite tiles are bunkers, which can be drilled into the rock, and score points based on the number of other, on-screen bunkers they're linked to. Getting a vertical streak of bunkers feels like the key to transforming a mere Aquarius Reef Base into a credible Rapture. Science centres, meanwhile, earn points every time the screen scrolls for as long as they're visible, so you'll want to park them as far down as possible. And city centres, finally, give you the next three buildings for free.</p>
<p>It might feel like there aren't enough building types, but the game squeezes some decent intricacy out of these variations, and the pixelart is quite tasty. The real limitation, perhaps, is that too much depends on luck of the draw. As such, Podvodsk is best played in Tactical Mode, which stores any building piece you don't play for one turn, and thus allows you to strategise a little - placing scaffolding at first to move your seaweed farm closer to a bountiful kelp forest.</p>
<p>The relationships between scoring criteria remind me of wooden token game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/406660/seaside">Seaside</a>, except that Seaside sticks to the shore. If you're concerned about playing anything from a Russian developer, given the on-going invasion of Ukraine, it's worth noting that Four Quarters <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-loop-hero-devs-tell-players-to-pirate-their-game-because-of-sanctions/">have publicly opposed the war</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-underwater-cities-out-of-tetris-pieces-in-podvodsk-a-game-jam-freebie-from-the-loop-hero-developers]]></content:encoded>
