            <p>
I am sure the words "new" and "Ace Attorney game" have functioned as a sleeper agent's activation words for some of you, and these are words that Capcom themselves have sort of put together, but let's slow down before we get carried away. As spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man">Mega Man</a> fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html?m=1">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom have released their <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf">integrated report for 2025</a>, which for the most part is boring, corporate nonsense. Here comes the but. But! It also appears to suggest that the developer is thinking about new ways it can further develop series like Ace Attorney, as well as Mega Man and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Apologies for the business speak here, but this is what Capcom had to say: "Capcom owns a wealth of globally popular brands, such as Mega Man, Devil May Cry, and Ace Attorney. We aim to expand our user base and improve our performance through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware. By enhancing brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases, we will grow these into core IPs." Just one second, need to wash off the stench of buzz words real quick.
</p>
<p>
Right, back! Now, that obviously doesn't 100% confirm a new game for the likes of any of the mentioned titles. However, at this point, as far as I'm aware, there's literally only the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney crossover game that's left to be ported, so perhaps there's hope for both this and something new too, you rabid Phoenix x Miles shippers.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Mega Man, there hasn't been a new mainline game since 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, leaving ample room for a reawakening. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> came out in 2019, too, so it's not surprising Capcom is looking to breathe some life back into that one, even if it got a new mobile game last year. The developer has done quite well for itself with Resident Evil, Monster Hunter (well, not so much you, Wilds), and Street Fighter in recent years, so it isn't exactly a surprise that they're interested in a bigger slice of pie. Now all we need is a Dark Void reboot, the series everybody desperately wants a comeback for. Right? Right?

            <p>
Cassette Boy is a game that looks to follow in the footsteps of perspective puzzlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a> and Tunic, two games I bring up because of their explicit use of space to hide more, tantalizingly secret space. Out of the two, it's much closer to Fez, being a 2D world you can rotate to gain new, three dimensional perspectives. Where Fez is a platformer that switches between different, still 2D planes, Cassette Boy lets you switch between front on and more isometric views, and in its world, anything that can't be seen, doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
This means different things. Cassette Boy is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> RPG, one that emulates the look of an original Game Boy game, and RPGs typically come with dangers. Perhaps there's some kind of nasty beastie blocking your path, or spikes with no gap to cross through. Simply rotate to a new angle, and poof! They're gone. Rotate some more, and they pop right back into existence. You can see why the developer's referred to it as a "Schrödinger System."

There are battles to be had as well, with fairly simplistic but solid enough sword-based combat you've seen in any of the 2D Zeldas. I wonder how that, in particular, may come into play throughout the game, but I'm also curious if puzzles go a bit further than just making enemies or NPCs disappear so you can walk forwards, as that's mostly what the game's trailers show.
</p><p>
Still, it's a neat concept, one that I'm curious enough about to make me want to check it out. And I don't have to wait long to do that! As it's currently slated for release in just over a month's time on January 14th, 2026. Aside from the existential fear that comes from the steady passage of time, that's pretty good! You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/">here</a>.
