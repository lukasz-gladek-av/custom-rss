            <p>
Remember how the upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-co-op-sci-fi-robot-shooter-arriving-next-year">meant to launch in 2022</a>? Good times! And quite different times, because back then the game was PvE, seeing you and a few friends take on some nasty bots. Three years on, the game has shifted into a PvPvE experience, and the reason for 1. such a lengthy delay, and 2. a complete change in what players actually do is a simple one: the game was "not fun."
</p>
<p>
This isn't me being snarkily mean or anything, these are the words of Embark Studios' CEO Peter Soderlund himself. Speaking to Edge (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/the-5th-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam-ex-battlefield-devs-extraction-shooter-arc-raiders-was-delayed-3-years-because-they-realized-it-sucked-this-game-is-not-fun/">GamesRadar</a>), Sonderlund spoke of what it took to get the game to where it is now, explaining, "We loved every aspect of what we were trying to design. But we came to the conclusion, after quite a long time: 'Guys, this game is not fun.'"
</p>
<p>
To be specific, it apparently was more a case of not being fun enough than outright bad or boring. This then led to the team going back to figure out what the game's fundamentals were only six months before its supposed launch, and lo and behold, the PvPvE gameplay it now has was born.
</p>
<p>
Embark devs features an array of PvP pedigree, including some that have worked on both Battlefield and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> (shame there's not a third Battle game to list here), but many apparently felt ready to move on from PvP as a format. So the 'vE' element really helped to mix things up, especially because the game also took some cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> with its massive enemies to take down, although in this case they're big ole robots instead.
</p><p>
And now, all this time later, there's less than a month to go until we find out whether it ultimately works for the masses or not. I'm not big on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, but I'll admit the vibes have piqued my curiosity at the very least. My biggest concern, and perhaps the game's too, is it being an extraction shooter. Those that love 'em, love 'em, but they're truly only really for the sickos right now. Let's see if Arc Raiders can take the genre to the mainstream!
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders launches October 30th.

I could probably quite safely bet some money that many of you are still happily ticking away at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but for those of you that would like newer pastures to get your TTRPG fix in video game form, there's some good news. The board game-esque tactical RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
You won't be waiting long for it, as it's slated for release this coming November 20th. No pound sterling or euro pricing for the game yet, but in USD it'll set you back $30 - it's also cross-platform and cross-device compatible, so no biggie if your friends aren't on PC! And if it being more Dungeons &amp; Dragons something or other, relatively affordable, and cross-everything isn't enough for you, when Steam Next Fest kicks off next October 13th you'll be able to try out a demo for yourself.

<p>
This demo lets you try out a couple of encounters, with four heroes to choose from, including Jessix, a "human ranger seeking retribution" that is apparently a new reveal alongside this release date announcement! Plus, playing the demo will unlock an exclusive cosmetic for your d20s in the full game. Free stuff! Nobody hates free stuff!
</p><p>
If you haven't even heard of Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked before, well, it's a crossover between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, which is also a fantasy, board game-esque tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, albeit set in its own world, with (you guessed it) D&amp;D! You move little figures around a board while going through different campaigns, a big selling point being that it has online multiplayer, something Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked will also have. And you'll be able to play it in VR too if that takes your fancy!
</p>
<p>
Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is out November 20th, later this year.

            <p>
There's a strong chance a good few of you out there saw that initial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> trailer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">last year</a> and thought "I'll take a piece of that pie." You came pretty close to getting your slice too, as it was due out next week on October 8th… except the devs have announced that it's been delayed. Indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348?l=english">Steam news post</a>, Redemption Road apologised for not meeting the release date before explaining why the delay is taking place. "In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier." The post notes how the team is 80% engineers, and that they set out to make the game with a goal of making sure the game runs at a true 60 frames per second even on midrange PCs, "without the need for fake frames."
</p>
<p>
Redemption Road further explained all the things that supposedly makes the game so complicated, with battles featuring "tens of thousands of soldiers," and there being "giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed… Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore - with or without their own personal army of thousands. We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, this is an indefinite delay, there was no suggestion from Redemption Road as to when it could possibly come out. Still, a delay less than a week from release is pretty surprising just because of how close it actually is. Looking at the game itself, I do feel less surprised.
</p><p>
There really are just a metric tonne of NPCs on screen at any one time, there's anachronistic guns, tanks, and cars, you can build stuff, a lot of moving parts are clearly at play here! Good look to the devs.
