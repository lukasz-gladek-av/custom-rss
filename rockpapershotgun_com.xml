            <p>The appearance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bernband">Bernband</a> during last night's PC Gaming Show had a few of us at RPS clicking our fingers and pointing at our monitors yelling: "Bernband! Bernband!" This remake of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-being-pleasantly-lost-bernband">best sci-fi walking sim of 2014</a> has been in the works for a while. Creator Tom van den Boogaart has dipped in and out of working on the alien wanderer, often switching focus to other projects such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a>. But now it looks like we are once again getting a trickle of sweet extraterrestrial wanderlust. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Bernband is a sci-fi exploration sim set in a bustling alien metropolis," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789170/Bernband/">the Steam page</a>. "Wander the streets at your leisure. See the sights, from dodgy dive bars to sprawling mega-marts. Discover secret areas, or hang out with the locals! There are no missions or timers; your only goal is to take a stroll."</p>
<p>That lack of goals and objectives puts it once again firmly into walking simulator turf, but if it shares even a bit of the atmospheric richness of the original walkabout, that is absolutely grand. When Bernband <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-alien-city-bernband">first appeared</a>, it offered a crowded little world of alien barflies, night clubs, high walkways, creepy alleys, xeno churches, school classrooms, and plenty of elevators connecting it all together. </p>
<p>It was a wonderful city to get lost in, and a reminder that simply dandering around a strange place can be exciting without having to collect anything, or even speak to anyone. As Alice O put it at the time, it's "about the freedom of being alone in a crowd, the joy of noise washing over you and filling you, and the pleasure of wandering with no purpose beyond wanting to have time to yourself and see some interesting things."</p>
<p>The original game's maker, Van den Boogaart, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bernband-gifs">periodically shared some of his ongoing work</a> on the remake. But it would often submerge again for some time as he worked on other things. After all, the creator is a member of the busiest gang of Dutch game tinkerers in the world, the Sokpop Collective (who are also credited as helping on this remake). Sokpop are a a kind of romantic ideal of the games industry - a crowd-funded independant gang of mates who have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-releasing-their-100th-game-and-aiming-for-100-more">made over 100 games</a> after announcing their plan to release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-popping-out-a-new-game-every-2-weeks">a new plaything every two weeks</a>. Their many many works include village building card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stacklands-is-a-gentle-village-building-game-played-with-cards">Stacklands</a>, and tiny controller-friendly RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/king-pins-is-sokpops-teeny-tiny-take-on-age-of-empires">King Pins</a>.  </p>
<p>No release date for Nu-Bernband yet, but we will stay ever vigilant. Bernband. Bernband!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
