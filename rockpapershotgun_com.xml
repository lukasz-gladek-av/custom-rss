  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> was one of a number of games Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">tossed in the bin</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs earlier this year</a>. It was disappointing, if not a huge surprise given how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rare-have-started-over-on-everwild-rumours-say">protracted Everwild's development had been</a> up until its demise, with lots of questions remaining as to what the mysterious ramble through nature would be like to play.</p>
<p>Now, some leaked screenshots might offer a bit more of an idea as to some of the stuff you'd have been able to get up to in between patting various creatures and swinging a staff around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The screens, spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details">mp1st</a>, offer a look at the game's interfaces and menus. The site report they've come from an artist's website and are from a version of the game that existed not long before Microsoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>
<p>One sees the player character standing with their inventory open, with their pockets boasting tools, plants, seeds, mosaics, and figments. It's the latter that's caught my attention, as they look to be cute little plant creatures. Given the farm or base building-esque feel of the menu, might these figments have been pint-sized helpers with your gardening ventures? Sadly, we won't know until someone from Rare chats about the game.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="es"><p>Se han publicado screenshots del cancelado <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Everwild?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Everwild</a> a través de un artista que estuvo en <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rare</a> para el proyecto.</p><p>De acuerdo a lo informado a MP1ST, estas imágenes serían de una versión del juego bastante cercana a su cancelación en Junio de este año. <a href="https://t.co/FN9ci0VOMn">pic.twitter.com/FN9ci0VOMn</a></p></div>— Soul Gizzmo (@SoulGizzmo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulGizzmo/status/1977514481581273449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>A couple of other screens show the character standing by a patch of grass ringed by an overgrown path. Twinned with the statue and columns you can make out in some of the shots, some exploration or uncovering of old ruins or temples looks possible. Such a thing would match the druidy vibes of Everwild's trailers, and it'd make sense if the group of eternals the player belonged to were an ancient sect or culture you'd learn more about by exploring their former abodes. Or perhaps you'd be tasked with exploring the old homes of another civilisation who in some way messed up the rhythm of nature and paid for it.</p>
<p>A couple of the screens are also very blurry, so maybe you'd find a camera in these ruins and be physically unable to work out how to use the focus, because you're far too focused on helping some salamander thing gently vomit what I assume to be its kids into a river. That last thing happens in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSWnnQMSPjc&amp;t=126s">this trailer</a> at around the 1:15 mark, lest you accuse me of ruining your day with made up tales of water-based creatures blowing chunks.</p>
<p>It's sad that this and dev testimonies are how Everwild's mysteries'll be uncovered, rather than by folks who've fired up a complete game, but such is the nature of projects which never see the light of day.</p>

            <p>Alright readers, here’s the bad news: the Maw ate Edwin. I know, it’s unfortunate, but we all saw it coming. You can’t feed a Stygian horror nothing but PC game releases and expect it to simply forget about protein. The <em>good</em> news is that the Maw isn’t a particularly thorough masticator, so I imagine Edwin will have clambered back out by, ooh, say, Wednesday. Like that episode of the Samurai Jack reboot, except he spends even more time in a loincloth.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>No field battle-sized megagames this week, but there is another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> launching later today, Monday 13th October. That means demos: free demos, loads of demos, far too many demos, dear God how did you people make so many demos. Who’s got a game they’re hoping to see demo-fied? I continue waiting in quiet, some might say blind hope that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> emerges from its years of silence. But we’ll see.</p>
<h2>Monday 13th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891020/Undusted_Letters_from_the_Past/">Undusted: Letters from the Past</a> is a breezy object restoration game in which you polish, scrub, and mini-vacuum old tat to learn the stories of its owners.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386750/Spindle/">Spindle</a>, a pixelly action-adventure, casts you as Death in a world where nobody’s dying. That leaves plenty of time to go fishing and tend to your pet pig, mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 14th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Mohrta</a> is a free-roaming fantasy FPS with an abundance of Morrowind-y weirdness.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527820/Chickenhare_and_the_treasure_of_SpikingBeard/">Chickenhare and the Treasure of Spiking-Beard</a> is clearly going for 2000’s 3D platformer charm, and looks family-friendly almost to a fault.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 15th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/">Ball X Pit</a> would like one of every genre, please. It’s a Breakout-influenced survival schmup (with, to be fair, amusingly chaotic bouncy-ball projectiles) that ties in base-building and is, of course, a roguelike.</li>
<li>Anarchic comedy adventure<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/"> GlitchSPANKR</a> seems a bit loud for me, though I support more developers making Jazzpunk-style jokefests.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1830320/Lords_of_Ravage/">Lords of Ravage</a> has you playing the baddie, namely a commander of mishmashed monster units you’ll be pitting against heroes in turn-based battles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 16th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, a co-operative fantasy dungeon raider (sans MMO grinding), launches into early access.</li>
<li>Quacking parody <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape from Duckov</a> replaces Tarkov’s extraction shooting and gross imperial undercurrents with silly vibes and twin-stick-style, purely PvE action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 17th October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2852760/This_Is_No_Cave/">This Is No Cave</a>. Then what is it? A single-button, high-speed grapply platformer, apparently.</li>
<li>Double Fine’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043580/Keeper/">Keeper</a> lets you play – finally – as a lighthouse with legs. Looks a bit linear, but previews suggest this has some pretty clever puzzling, often involving the scraggly bird who’s perched atop your bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d say this was a quiet week before we somehow get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> all within a two-day window, but there’s no such thing as a quiet Next Fest week. It’s just... Christ, demos. <em>Everywhere</em>.</p>

<p>This latest pulling of Borderlands 4 future additions from Randall Pitchenford's hat took place at PAX Australia. The man himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w6mSoYgaiPI?t=165s">walked onto stage</a>, mentioned his magicness, and referenced Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan in the presence of a 13 year old.</p><p>In light of that, I'll point out that you find out all of the info you need about what he was revealing via a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">handy post</a> that's less Pitchfordy. First of all, Borderlands 4's first paid DLC bounty pack dubbed How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will arrive on November 20th. It'll be an extra missions, legendary gear and boss fight affair based around Outbounders leader Rush battling with a dude called Screw over the way in which some kind of sellsword holiday celebration is, er, celebrated. This DLC's also bundled in with the deluxe editions of the game, so you'll get it at no extra cost if you've already spent extra money.</p>
<p>Preceding that will be a free Halloween-themed event called Horrors of Kairos, which is set to run from October 23rd to November 6th. It'll bring new legendary loot and also add blood rain to world boss battles. Make sure you don't mistake the crimson precipitation for jam, I suppose. Also, whose blood is it? Do we assume that it belonged to folks the boss has previously slain, in which case you might end up having your own blood drop on your bonce? Is there some kind of special Halloween blood supply that the gnomes who run Borderlands 4's clouds will only uncork every Halloween, like some aged vintage?</p>
<p>I digress, on to the final set of additions for this year. A free December update's set to deliver some extra bits to keep those who've already battled through almost all of the game happy. Bloomreaper the Invincible is a mutant tree thing, and also the first in a series of invincible endgame bosses who aren't actually invincible. As with its namesake Crawmerax the Invincible, however, Bloomreaper will be very tough. In line with that, the update'll also deliver a new difficulty level for Ultimate Vault Hunter mode.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Gearbox'll also be keeping up the patches, with next week's looking very much like it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-director-warns-next-patch-will-target-overpowered-builds-relying-on-unintended-interactions">murder some overpowered builds</a>.</p>
