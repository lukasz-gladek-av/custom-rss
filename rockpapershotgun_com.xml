            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s narrative really kicks into gear when, after a job gone wrong, metal-infused merc protagonist V realises they're now living in the shadow of a Keanu Reeves-shaped clock. Despite this, you're free to while away hours doing a million things other than confronting your urgent mortality problem. It's something even CD Projekt themselves have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3m7sfrres7s2l">joked about</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to the heist going askew, however, there's an opening section in which V's working their way up through the ranks of Night City's underworld alongside Jackie Welles. This bit can last a while if you're happy to run after every side quest right out of the gate, but a lot of folks breeze through it, keen to be whisked into exploring all of the game's metropolis as rapidly as the action plays out in the cutscene which fast-forwards through most of the time Jackie and V spend making a name for themselves. So, in hindsight, would CD Projekt have benefitted from having this section of the main narrative run a bit longer? In the eyes of Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski, the answer's a firm no, a view he's explained in a flurry of posts.</p>
<p>Writing on BlueSky (as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-2-director-says-extending-2077s-opening-act-makes-no-sense/">FRVR</a>), Sarzynski addressed the question of extending the pre-heist act head on, arguing that it wouldn't make for a better experience and is "like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff". Random shade thrown at uncle Owen and aunt Beru aside, Sarzynski's argument for this section working better as is revolves around the idea that the main perceived benefit of giving folks more time to bond with Jackie before, er, that thing happens to him at Konpeki Plaza wouldn't outweigh the drawbacks of a more drawn-out arc prior to the fatal twist in V's tale.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifv6rfa5ld57n7bcs76xz3qvtgxvouymheiga6sninoay3s5zuvza" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbokwdsals27"><div lang="en"><p>So would extending Act 1 (before the heist) in CP77 make the game better?

1. No it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.

</span></p><p>"The motivation/goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience," the developer argued, acknowledging that it is possible at current to spend up to 20 hours or so just exploring Watson during the pre-heist arc. As to whether the section as is offers enough time to grow close to Jackie and make what happens to him bear the emotional weight it's designed to, Sarzynski admitted that'll vary from player to player, but added: "All things considered, I think we struck a good balance."</p><p>The start of Cyberpunk sometimes feeling like a bit of a rush to get everything in position for the main narrative arc to really kick off with the introduction of Silverhand and the relic's long been an aspect of it that I've seen not necessarily as bad, but certainly something that could potentially have been improved. The cutscene montage of early jobs definitely made it harder initially for me to fully buy into the elements of the story surrounding clawing your way to Night City legend status. Ostensibly watching someone else blast through the start of that path in sped up fashion takes you out of it a bit, and you don't get as full a picture of day-to-day life with Jackie as you otherwise might.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of the game unfolding in a manner which inundates you with side stuff which essentially feels like pushing snooz on a threat of death which is supposed to feel inescapable and crushing from act two onwards. Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mboxdpmils2f">acknowledged that here</a>, writing: "If I were to do it again, I'd contextualize gigs and sidequests as escaping death in a different way - by creating your own legend. And maybe gate a specific ending behind doing enough side content." So, possibly a lesson which could be applied in some fashion to Cyberpunk 2 there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as someone who feels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - a game which also draws plenty of good from its general commitment to taking the lengthy and massively detailed route - start to drag a bit as its Western epic tale trots from the mid-game towards the end, I can very much see Sarzynski's point about act one.</p>
<p>Both approaches can make for great games. In my book, a bigger issue in the base version of Cyberpunk arguably suffers due to is Johnny Silverhand's regular presence and commentary sometimes feeling like it can undercut that game's ability not to fill moments of silence that'd be perfect for Bladerunner-style broody contemplation with chatter that may not add much to proceedings. That's a balance I felt was nailed a lot better in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a>, simply by having Songbird cut in as a second voice in your head and offer some variety in outside perspective on events.</p>
<p>As for Jackie, it's a bit of a cold way to put it given his fate, but I think he's got just enough of a presence to fulfil his narrative role of early-game buddy cut down in his prime.</p>

            <p>In what has become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">CPU tradition</a>, AMD have announced a new fastest-ever gaming processor to replace their last fastest-ever gaming processor. The newcomer, detailed at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2026">CES 2026</a>, is the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which actually shares the same architecture, socket, core and thread counts, and power usage rating as the erstwhile big dog, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It’s mainly a quicker maximum boost clock, up from 5.2GHz to 5.6GHz, that grants it a performance edge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And cor, what a fine edge it is. By AMD’s reckoning, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D averages 27% better framerate results in games than Intel’s best offering, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra 9 285K</a>. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D? 24% better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tep42MpeD_Y&amp;list=PLTU_E21aX_rgRFQRrnvYySBt24dQUTXQC">Destroyed in seconds</a>.</p>

<p>The 9850X3D is out in Q1 2026, i.e. between January and March. There’s no pricing info yet, so we don’t know much extra that 3% will cost ya, though it’s probably worth noting that CPUs have seemingly been spared from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">stock disaster currently engulfing RAM and SSDs</a> (and threatening to drag in graphics cards while it’s at it). As such, any big bump over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s $479 launch price would be, at best, extremely cheeky. Here be specs, in any case:</p>
<h3>AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Zen 5</li>
<li><strong>Socket:</strong> AM5</li>
<li><strong>Cores:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Threads:</strong> 16</li>
<li><strong>Base clock:</strong> 4.7GHz</li>
<li><strong>Max boost clock:</strong> 5.6GHz</li>
<li><strong>L1 cache:</strong> 640KB</li>
<li><strong>L2 cache:</strong> 8MB</li>
<li><strong>L3 cache:</strong> 96MB</li>
<li><strong>TDP:</strong> 120W</li>
<li><strong>Max temp:</strong> 95°c</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of the 9800X3D, any healthy computer-owning mind should keep a guard up around superlatives, but I’ve got one in the RPS Test Rig and it kinda <em>is</em> the fastest gaming CPU. Or, at least, it was. Now that there’s a newer version, I’ve naturally had to spend the morning berating it for its idleness and incompetence, which is why this post is only going live several hours after AMD’s announcement.</p>

<p>Developers Square Enix and HexaDrive have announced that this demo'll arrive for PC on January 7th, putting out the news alongside the game's intro movie. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not make the same mistake I did and go top watch the intro movie without making sure your headphones are at a suitably reasonable volume. Anyway, the movie shows off the loveably cartoonly 3D facelift Reimagined gives Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, just in case you missed that being revealed during last September's Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>While I have zero Dragon Quest credentials with which to offer in-depth judgement, there's an undeniable charm to the new diorama-heavy style in which Akira Toyama's designs have been rendered this time, even if some of the facial expressions occasionally get very weird. Though, this being a cutscene, it seemingly doesn't offer much in the way of showing off the revamped battle mechanics and "significantly streamlined" story Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">have promised</a>, with both of those changes aimed at making things more accessible to newbies and veterans.</p><p>Going back to the demo, in addition to the handy save data carryover, Square Enix revealed that everyone who dips their toe into the demo will be given an outfit dubbed the “Day Off Dress” which Maribel can wear in the full game.</p>
<p>That full release is still penned in for February 5th, 2026. You can wishlist Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499860/DRAGON_QUEST_VII_Reimagined/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined, and/or check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">our review of Dragon Quest III's HD-2D Remake</a> if you're keen to inject more words about revamped lizard adventures into your brain.</p>

            <p>CES 2026 is underway in Las Vegas, and while Nvidia have passed on the opportunity to announce any new RTX 50 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> – perhaps in the knowledge that they’d be hurled directly into the raging vortex of an ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component pricing snafu</a> – the tech show has yielded some interesting GeForce news. Namely, there’s a new version of Nvidia DLSS, 4.5, launching today, that promises to sharpen up and boost performance on any RTX GPU.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Its Super Resolution component is a second-generation upgrade to the 'Transformer' upscaling model introduced with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, and on top of the improvements that version made over ye olde Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of dee-ell-ess-esses past, it supposedly benefits from "greater contextual awareness" of the image it’s upscaling at any given moment. Nvidia say this produces higher-res frames with sharper detailing, less ghosting on moving images – a DLSS classic, that one – and generally cleaner, smoother anti-aliasing.</p>

<p>Yah, like that.</p>
<p>No details on performance yet; DLSS 4’s Transfomer model was slightly less effective than CNN at jacking up framerates, but then the picture quality upgrade was arguably worth it, so you won’t catch me sobbing into my keyboard so long as DLSS 4.5 keeps the pace. Compatibility doesn’t sound like it’ll be much of a problem, either, as over 400 games will be compatible with DLSS 4.5 via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a>’s DLSS Override tool. The new Transformer model works on all current RTX-branded graphics cards, too – not just the latest RTX 50 series.</p><p>What you <em>will</em> need a 50 series card for is DLSS 4.5’s other major feature, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation. This won’t be out until Spring 2026, so it’s even less of an issue if you just want the new upscaler right this second, but in short, this builds on DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation (MFG) by allowing you to set a target FPS – likely one that syncs with the max refresh rate of your monitor – and only producing enough AI-hewn frames to meet that target. Instead of, as in DLSS 4 MFG, sticking to a flat 2x, 3x, or 4x multiplier, though Dynamic MFG can apparently stretch as high as 6x.</p>
<p>While the more widely known (if still Nvidia-supported) flavour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a> has thus far been a litany of unfulfilled promise, intellectual property theft, and weirdly, RAM prices going haywire, the very specific application of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in DLSS – and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-redstone-explained">AMD rival, FSR</a> – is relatively benign. Instead of sending a prompt to a power-hungry data centre, where images or text are aggregated from potentially stolen original works, DLSS is trained on a single supercomputer, and its actual generation work is done entirely on your own, probably sub-1000W PC, merely to create frames from data provided by the game it’s currently rendering. Which, obviously, requires the developers’ permission, given they’re the one who integrated DLSS in the first place. I don’t know how widespread confusion between the two genAI styles actually is, but there’s my reckoning, in case you ever wonder why I’m moaning about one while accepting the other.</p>
<p>Still, as a performance tool per se, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">frame generation has issues</a>, including ones I fear may be exacerbated by a 6x multiplier. MFG has already shown us that the more generated frames your GPU shoves out, the lower your supply of 'real', traditionally rendered frames. These are the ones you want to truly keep high, as they determine how fluid and responsive a fast-paced game feels in your mousing hand – generated frames only add visual smoothness, not tactile improvements, and in fact increase input lag. I’m not sure I’d ever want to engage 4x, 5x, or 6x frame gen unless I was already getting at least 70-80fps in normal frames to compensate for the reduced responsiveness, at which point, even a 240Hz monitor wouldn’t need such hefty multipliers to max out.</p>
<p>The new upscaler sounds good, though.</p>
