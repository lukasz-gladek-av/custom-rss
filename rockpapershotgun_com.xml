            <p>Bang bang. A Doom modder who's been busy recreating the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the setting for some irradiated boomer shooting has released a fresh trailer to the public for the first time in years.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin looks to have been quietly beavering away at GZDoom WAD Fallout: Bakersfield since releasing its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjJM9HAqqk">last teaser in 2022</a>, having posted fairly regular update blogs for supporters on his <a href="https://boosty.to/red888guns">Boosty profile</a>. For the rest of us, this fresh trailer's the best look we've gotten yet at what Berezin - who's worked on classic Fallout mods like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509613179">Olympus 2207</a> and <a href="https://cambragol.github.io/Fallout-Sonora/">Fallout: Sonora</a> - has been up to when not <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">doing stuff</a> for publishers New Blood Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the trailer, it kicks off with the sort of pullback through some ruins as fifties-ish music plays that I'm fairly sure you're mandated by law to include in all Fallouty things. Once we're in the shoes of our Vault Doomweller, the shootiness starts.</p>
<p>Roaming around the mod's version of the first Fallout game's Necropolis, you'll be shooting and stabbing away at hordes of ferals, as your face contorts and grimaces on a status bar that's very much the unholy Doollout/Falloom union that you'd hope.</p>

<p>There's a wonderful crunchiness to every attack, as enemies burst into piles of gore that'll make your average bloody mess perk taker erupt into squeals of pure ecstacy. Then, at the end, mirroring how the fight through the city of the dead in Fallout 1 goes, there's a showdown with Harry the Super Mutant. He thinks he's gonna beat your head now, and he might if you're not quick to start blasting.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like a really cool way to flip an old school Fallout sequence on its head. The mod is currently 60% done, all in all. Berezin breaks that down into four areas, with walls/tiles and scenery both being 80% of the way there, while weapons/UI and creatures are only 50 and 30% sorted respectively. There's no firm release date as of yet, with the modder only committing to getting Fallout: Bakersfield out there before the 2020s are over.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm happy to wait, and I'm not just saying that because it looks like Berezin's pretty handy at blowing  annoyances to bits with a beefy virtual shotgun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level]]></content:encoded>
