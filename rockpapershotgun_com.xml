            <p>If you keep an eye on the big, ambitious Fallout mods that're always in the works, you might have heard of Fallout: Revelation Blues. Its developers have been plugging away at remaking Van Buren - the version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> which was in development at Black Isle Studios before being cancelled in 2003 - as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mod for the past few years. While they released a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-new-vegas-mod-revelation-blues-demo-van-buren">first demo last year</a> under the Revelation Blues moniker, the group have decided to re-christen their project Fallout: The New West ahead of releasing a second demo at some point soon.</p>

<p>Ahead of that, the name change has been set in stone by the release of the fresh teaser above and the launch of a <a href="https://falloutthenewwest.com/">new website</a>. Why the switch from Revelation Blues? Well, one of the mod's devs going by the handle Caveman6667 has explained on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1447407535437905920">Discord</a> that the group concluded Revelation Blues was "a mystery of a name for many passersby and isn't a grabby title". The New West, meanwhile, they feel fits the mod better, as it'll feature "many allusions and references to the Old West".</p>
<p>So, out with the old and in the New West as the modders gear up to release a second demo, this time focused around Van Buren's opening sequence. You're in Tibbets prison, a pen run by an AI dubbed Odysseus, and you've gotta break out of that joint while a new plague's also on the loose in the section of American southwest the mod's set in. The modders wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1468679368711864462">Discord post</a> put out alongside the teaser that they're "fairly confident" they could put a release date on this Tibbets demo right now, but have instead elected to play it safe and simply declare they're "very very very close" to delivering it.</p><p>As outlined on the sparkly new website, the New West crew's current plan is to get this "alternate start demo" out of the way, then "follow it up with the entirety of act one of the game as a vertical slice". If you're keen for a taster of what the mod's full experience'll be like, they've also provided the following handy blurb outlining its key tenets and aims:</p>
<blockquote><p>In many ways, it tells the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience. The project’s primary narrative goal is to take the disparate plot threads and unfinished concepts found in the original design documents, including for example, the NCR–Brotherhood conflict, the Great Tribal War between Caesar’s Legion and the Daughters of Hecate, the fight for the soul of the Mormon State and much more, and weave them into a satisfying, unified narrative that adheres to the main plot as described in the design documents.</p>
<p>Players assume the role of a new protagonist,released from captivity in 2253, known as "the Prisoner", and the story is set in an alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas. Unfortunately due to many Van Buren concepts being folded into FNV, we cannot set the project in the same timeline. Our secondary goal is to incorporate many of the modern gameplay conveniences introduced through Fallout: New Vegas and its more than fifteen years of modding, while preserving the distinctive mechanics and design quirks of classic Fallout found in the original design documents.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I'm not as voracious a Van Buren lore sponge as other Fallout enjoyers, the New West's re-creation of a wasteland adventure we never got has certainly piqued my interest, so here's hoping the upcoming demo's a good one. If you fancy giving the mod's first demo - Burham Springs - a go in the interim you can find it on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91191?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-machine-is-still-on-track-for-its-original-release-window-according-to-valves-chosen-chipmakers">AMD’s assurances to the contrary</a>, Valve have announced that they’ve pushed back release plans for the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> VR headset. Alas, my curse of publishing news posts roughly 0.0045 seconds before a major situation change continues to ruin my life – sometimes I wish I’d never beaten the warlocks in that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> pub match.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Instead of "early 2026," the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">original release window</a>, Valve are now only aiming to ship the hardware trio "in the first half of the year." No prizes for guessing the cause, either: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">Steam blog post</a> notes specifically that ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">memory and SSD shortages</a>, caused by the tech industry buying up components to build infrastructure for AI products, have both scuppered the initial launch plans and delayed Valve’s decision on how the Steam Machine and its brethren will be priced.</p>
<p>"When we announced these products in November," the post reads, "we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).</p>
<p>"Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible."</p><p>If the Machine, Controller, and Frame <em>do</em> arrive in the first half of 2026, that ultimately wouldn’t be an interminable wait beyond the originally announced window. Higher-than-expected prices seem like a given, though, particularly for the Machine and the Frame. The Steam Controller might at least dodge the blow of the economics hammer, as it contains neither a fat SSD nor a pile of RAM.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is bitterly add "Hopes of a cheap living room PC" to the list of all the things that the AI uranium rush has destroyed, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">general component pricing</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">Crucial</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-than-half-of-gamedev-professionals-see-genai-as-harmful-according-to-gdcs-latest-survey">game developers’ opinions of AI</a>.</p>
