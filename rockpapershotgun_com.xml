            <p>
Once upon a time, the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh rose from his slumbers, scratched the opals from his beard of woven copper, and said to himself: "Today I will make a 3D egg platform game in which a 3D egg goes platforming, like my hit game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>, but 3D and with eggs." And because there was no-one around to say "WTF, Terry" or "perhaps you are just hungry" or "Mr Cavanagh, the egg's paucity of external appendages and senses wholly disallow it as a means of self-directed locomotion", that is exactly what he did. 
</p>
<p>
We are all the richer for it, because Egg (subtitle "why not be an egg") is eggcellent. It's also free and <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/egg">playable right now in a browser on Itch.io</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Where Cavanagh's early influences include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, in which there's a chapter that has you defending a giant condor egg against Shinra, I happen to be a graduate of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> University, which teaches that eggs are the work of Satanic industrialists. As such, I was profoundly suspicious of the egg platformer concept, but there is ample precedent: the Dizzy series (in which the egg has hands and feet), the shellshocked and yolk-crazed Billy the Hatcher, and the recent physics-me-do <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2897610/Egging_On/">Egging On</a>. Sometimes when Sonic curls into a ball, I think that he looks rather like an egg. But then I close my eyes and bang my temples until the demons go away.
</p>
<p>
Cavanagh's Egg is both familiar of structure and tonally eggcentric. It puts you in charge of a supermarket box of six eggs, perched on a cliffside. Your job - I think, based on about 30 minutes with the game - is to control and guide the eggs one by one to a nest, somewhere in the landscape. It's possible there's a moral here about industrial poultry farming, but I don't want to bust out the <a href="https://kimstallwood.substack.com/p/the-sexual-politics-of-meat-by-carol">Carol Adams</a> just yet. I've succeggsfully guided just one egg to a "nest" so far. It slumbers now in a clump of frogspawn on a sandbank, deep underwater.
</p><p>
 The world is a stark, pixellated, precarious and arbitrary yet somehow consoling expanse of ledges and moving platforms and tunnels and whirling machinery, divided into discreet biomes that are linked by warp pipes. You move with WASD, look with the mouse, and jump with space, holding down the bar to charge up higher jumps.</p>
<p>It's a little fiddly, with lots of deadly drops, but not that punishing: checkpoints are plentiful, and you have infinite lives. Also, when you slide down a slope to a messy doom your egg makes a charmingly wibbly ooh-er noise. I think the eggs are all voiced by Cavanagh himself. Pretty sure Hideo Kojima has never voiced an egg.
</p>
<p>Who can explain the scrambled imaginings of the great graven cave troll Terry Cavanagh? It's possible <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/09/about-the-egg-game/">this blog post</a> might shed some light. Do a battery hen factory sim next, Terry.

            <p>
For as video gamey a series as The Matrix is, it is a touch surprising there have only been a handful of actual games. Obviously the one that makes most sense is The Matrix Online, what other genre but an MMO could The Matrix could be? Well, there's also Enter The Matrix, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-enter-the-matrix">which is basically Max Payne</a>, but you still have to wonder what else could have been. Especially because The Wachowskis literally pitched the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima making a Matrix game directly to Konami.
</p>
<p>
Christopher Bergstresser, the former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, recently spoke with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/no-one-ever-told-me-such-a-conversation-had-taken-place-kojima-wasnt-aware-of-the-wachowskis-matrix-game-offer">Time Extension</a> about this apparent pitch, explaining that "The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima." He explained, "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!"
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
The pair of directors attended the meeting with their visual effects lead, asking if Konami and Kojima would make a Matrix game, to which Kitaue (who went on to become CEO of Konami) apparently plainly said "'No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though." Except, apparently, according to Kojima himself, he wasn't even aware of such a pitch.
</p>
<p>
After word of Time Extension's report went around, Kojima took to his personal English Twitter account to say that he was "surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project!' back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place."
</p><p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> director went on to explain that he does recall having met the Wachowskis three times, and that they had attended Konami's headquarters, but Kojima only showed up after the meeting with Kitaue had taken place. He also remembers attending the Japanese premiere and party, but "even then, there was no mention of an offer."
</p>
<p>
It's this bit that will leave you with thoughts of what could have been: "At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work." Alas, now we'll never know! Which makes me a touch sad, because I would love to live in a world where his hypothetical Matrix game reads your browser history to judge you or something, you know, one of those classic oddball Kojima features.
