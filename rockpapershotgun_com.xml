            <p>
Techland's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> launched last week and is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-review">sources say</a>, "a good Dying Light game, and a fine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> zombie game in general, full of crunchy combat and simple but satisfying number-go-up loops". Being a new videogame, it also has some bugs. The most dramatic of these appear to be problems with its day/night cycle and weather system. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On the one hand, you've got rain falling inside buildings. I quite like this one, myself. I grew up with 3D first-person games that had slightly magic precipitation. I used to enjoy wobbling back and forth in entrances, trying to coax the weather into following me in-doors. I actually feel slightly dissatisfied when I play one of those fancy modern shooters in which water bounces off corrugated metal roofing as it should.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Techland say they've identified some problems with the day-night cycle, inasmuch as it sometimes stops cycling. This seems more urgent, because Dying Light: The Beast is a very different game in the dark. You'll have to worry about Volatile zombos who are both resilient and inconveniently athletic, capable of chasing you all over the scenery while making frightful gargling noises in your ear. A few Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/1nmpd80/hotfix_121_update_indoor_rain_daynight_cycle/">report</a> encountering Volatiles in blazing sunlight. Others say they can't seem to progress their worlds beyond mid-morning, which doesn't seem quite as harrowing.
</p>
<p>
Techland are working on a PC hotfix for these things, but say they need to take their time testing the patch, because these particular issues aren't that frequent and they don't want to screw up anything else. "We already have a fix prepared, but because this bug only appears in rare situations, it takes a lot of extra testing," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/543368994111883033?l=english">a post on Steam from yesterday</a>. "We'll continue these tests over the weekend and most of Monday, and if no new occurrences of this issue appear, we'll release the hotfix to players right away on PC. This is our goal.
</p><p>
"If, however, we still spot any occurrences of the bug, we might need to go back, adjust the fix, and then re-test it again," the developers caution. "Thank you for your patience. We know these issues are frustrating to those who experience them, and we're doing everything we can to deliver a stable solution as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Techland's promises have met with an avalanche of comments telling them that they're prioritising the wrong fixes. Some people are mad about the frame rate, others complain about getting stuck in falling animations and quests not progressing. It doesn't seem like there are any catastrophic problems with the current PC build, but I'm keen to hear your thoughts, as ever. As for myself, I've played about three hours of Dying Light: The Beast, including 30 minutes of preview time, and I think that's probably enough for me. I like scampering over roofs but I just can't be arsed re-killing zombies any more.

It is written that when the Sumerian king Gilgamesh first beheld the gleaming ramparts of Uruk‐Haven, many centuries ago, he said unto his architects: "be sure to save up gaps for those long straight ones, and try your best to start a multiplier". But then Gilgamesh realised that, by means of temporal fluctuations too nonsensical to explain, he was actually looking at the submissions page for <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/FallingBlockJam">Falling Block Jam 2025</a>, the latest Itch.io "make a thing with a theme" festival, which ran from last week till today.

<p>
Falling block games! Such a simple concept, capable of so many perversions. I have played a handful of<a href="https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam/entries"> the jam's 239 entries</a> and found them to be enjoyable, if often rudimentary. As is the style round these parts, I will now try to briefly communicate their enjoyableness to you using words. This is honestly going to be quite difficult, because I keep seeing another entry I want to try.
</p>
<p>
A pretty one to start: <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/bloquecitos">Bloquecitos</a> is a Tetrislike with real-time physics, and blocks that merge to create different-shaped blocks when you match their patterns. It's a crafty rejig of the developer's previous <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/pancitomerge">Pancitomerge</a>. I'm fond of the mosaic tile patterns, and I like engineering cascades by merging two blocks so that others tumble together.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://apotheum.itch.io/this-side-up">This Side Up</a>, meanwhile, trades the "falling" component of the "falling block" genre for a gradually retreating 3D camera. You've got a shipping crate and you're trying to fill it with vintage household objects such as cacti, cathode-ray televisions, Nintendo Gamecubes, and lizard tanks.</p><p>I strongly relate to this one inasmuch as I had a bunch of stuff in lock-up during a flat move last year. There's a dark art to filling shipping crates so as to optimise both storage space and retrievability. I do not claim to have mastered this art. After all, I managed to divide up all my paired belongings between separate crates. I had left socks and saucepans in one box, right socks and saucepan lids in another. Get ye behind me, This Side Up! You are bringing back traumatic memories.

<a href="https://datagoblin.itch.io/bone-scrambler">Professor Gambler's Bone Scrambler</a> is a falling block game born of the fateful realisation that a thrown die is a kind of falling block. Each turn, it rolls out a line of dice. You then slide the line horizontally to match the blocks below and create combos, or spend points to reroll the set. How do you earn points? From combos. It's got nice chiptune aesthetics, as you might expect from a game that has also been submitted to <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13">GBJAM 13</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Pico-8 one next. In <a href="https://werxzy.itch.io/recycled-blocks">Recycled Blocks</a>, you control a little laser drone that has to sculpt blocks as they fall to complete work orders and remove them from the board. I found the control scheme a bit confusing, but I love the concept. Ditto the self-explanatory <a href="https://sunrysky.itch.io/circuit-makers">Circuit Makers</a>.</p><p><a href="https://walaber-ent.itch.io/jelly-well">Jelly Well</a>, meanwhile, gets two thumbs up for its subliminal hatred of LocoRocos and for its soundscape of human mouth noises. More of this kind of thing, please. Call of Duty games would sell twice as much if all the gun effects consisted of voice actors yelling "bang". I would hire Sir Anthony Hopkins to voice an AK47, myself.

<p>
Simply scrolling the Falling Block Jam submission feed makes me feel as though I'm losing badly at Tetris, so I'll resist the urge to write up any more. OK, one more, but only because it doesn't require a computer: <a href="https://npckc.itch.io/doctorvsvirus">Doctor Vs Virus</a> is a table-top falling block game you can play with a standard deck of cards.</p>
<p>If you see any others you like, please rotate and slide them dextrously into the comments below. Why not see if you can form a line with people recommending the same game - I'll try to add some block-clearing score attack functionality to our moderation software.
