            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> just got a small update, mostly to fix a long-running music bug. But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">the recent 20th anniversary update</a> for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Removed collision from an underwater tube that speed runners enjoy," write the developers in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/220/announcements/detail/4468229436805742594?snr=2___">the update post</a>, with traditional Valve inscrutability. They're talking about a large pipe in the sewers of the Route Kanal sequence, which you've got to flood with water to pass through (you can see said pipe <a href="https://youtu.be/ws4E2lIJXUU?feature=shared&amp;t=1520">in this playthrough</a>). It seems Valve always intended for this pipe to have a big "player clip" over it - an invisible wall you can see in the map editor image below. The clip would be set to vanish once you solve the puzzle by turning a nearby valve to flood the room.</p>

<p>Yet, for whatever reason, this invisible wall was previously only present in the Xbox 360 version of the game, according to speedrunners at SourceRuns, who've been <a href="https://wiki.openag.pro/en/Source/Source_game_and_engine_differences">diligently tracking recent changes</a> to the game. PC players have always been able to indulge in the speedrunning act of skipping the puzzle by, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/_5FNP2bEpT8?feature=shared&amp;t=615">glitchily clambering up the wall with a barrel</a>. Oh, you clever little speedos.</p>
<p>But the anniversary update two weeks ago "fixed" the original oversight by plopping the wall into the PC version too. As you can imagine, this made the usual speedrun trick impossible. </p>
<p>It's only one example of the many changes that make the anniversary update a no-go for the most furious of fastbois. Plenty of other bug fixes have effectively confiscated an arsenal of glitches that speedrunners use to zip through the game. One such nerfed trick is called the "Item Save Glitch" which I won't explain in detail but basically allows the player to blip through solid surfaces by using a cursed object to push themselves through locked gates like a fucked-up playdough man. That doesn't work in the new shiny version of the game, and so many serious speedrunners simply stick to older versions of the game anyway.</p><p>"We do primarily use older builds, most often ones from 2012-2013, especially at the top level," says speedrunner "Peng", who currently <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/hl2">holds the world record</a> for completing Half-Life 2 in under 38 minutes. "But at least I do find it unfortunate that we're missing out on some of the new changes, as some actually benefit speedrunners..."</p>
<p>In the end, Valve recognised that at least this one pipe should remain open for sprinty business, and yesterday's brief patch has fixed it by simply disabling collision on the player clip. It won't be quite enough to entice record holders to switch to new version, says Peng. But it's a decent gesture to novice speedrunners. </p>
<p>"We still likely won't be able to run on the latest build even with this pipe being open again, as the update seems to have made Item Save Glitch... harder, and for some people seemingly impossible (we don't know for sure yet). The reversal does make the latest version viable for beginners at least though, which is a good thing."</p>
<p>Okay, if you really want to know, the "item save glitch" is <a href="https://youtu.be/YHK0Ox_iTWM?feature=shared&amp;t=1125">explained in this (very good) video</a> that gives a full rundown of speedrunner strats for the shooter, and features Peng performing a lot of the tricks of the trade. </p><p>For ordinary players, meanwhile, the Half-Life 2 anniversary update was broadly good news, since it added Steam Workshop support and some developer commentary to the decades-old first person shooter. It also made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001">a bunch of smaller changes</a> in various levels, including bug fixes, texture corrections, and lighting tweaks. It's kind of bonkers that Gordon's great galumph is still having minor things like this tweaked, but it's also proof of the shooter's lasting appeal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror">r/twosentencehorror</a> will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-struggles-backlash-positive-reviews/">told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"If you take Paranormal Activity, it cost pennies and it made millions," Kciuk continued. TheGamer follow up in their article with The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blair-witch">Blair Witch</a> Project, Get Out, and Terrifier 3 as examples of low budget horror films that made a lot more than they cost. Get Out, for example, was the highest grossing debut based on an original screenplay in history as of 2017, raking in over $250 million worldwide on a budget $4.5 million.</p>
<p>"This is one of the genres in both film and games where you actually can take very little resources, and the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage," Kciuk went on, citing the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>. "It's a very small game, and it was done in like a month or two, and it earned millions of dollars. Horror tends to have those breakout hits from very small teams, or even solo developers."</p>
<p>I imagine that Kciuk doesn’t actually find spreadsheeting to be “the interesting part” about making horror. More, as she alludes to, the freedom to make some very effective work with limited resources. The proliferation of PSX-style horror speaks to her assertion that "the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage". I’m reminded, fittingly, of how the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> turned short draw distances into an aesthetic with that game’s iconic fog. There’s some great examples of horror cinema turning restrictions into innovation, too, like Sam Raimi’s shaky cam and travelling shots in The Evil Dead 2.</p><p>Still, this is also might be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on how few truly big-budget horror games actually gets made. Outside of Capcom’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> series, and the occasional outlier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-sales-figures-2-1-million">like Alien Isolation</a>, the fact that horror appears cost-effective might just be the result of small budget horror making up most of what’s available. There are also big games that suggest the opposite, like the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> - one of my personal favourites from recent years that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">still struggling to recoup development costs</a>.</p>
