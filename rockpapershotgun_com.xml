            <p>Sometimes things happen that you can't control. That's now been the case for developers Permadeath and their 2D sandbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/385380/Planet_Centauri/">Planet Centauri</a> twice on Steam, with first a wishlist bug and more recently the reveal of Valve's new hardware landing at just the right time to make the devs' task of getting eyeballs on their game more challenging than it would normally be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/planet-centauri-steam-machine-announcement-valve-daily-deal-sale/">Polygon</a>, Planet Centauri's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/385380/view/519699831627710608?l=english">1.0 launch</a> in December last year saw it run into what its developers were later informed by Valve to be "a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent". Oof. Valve, to their credit, did offer Permadeath a make-good in the form of having the game pop up as one of Steam's daily deals, which the steamy storerunners hoped would "help make up for lost visibility" from that launch day bug.</p>
<p>The studio were reportedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/">initially hesitant</a> to take up the offer, but ended up picking November 12th from a selection of dates Valve offered. That day rolled around and boom: Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">announced</a> a new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame VR headset. Naturally, Valve switched up the Steam storefront to blare that big news front and centre, making it much more difficult than usually might be the case for any deals or sales to stick out and catch folks' attention.</p>
<p>Laurent Lechat, one of Planet Centauri's devs, says they've had to chalk this up to yet another instance of "bad luck". They know they couldn't have expected Valve to offer a heads up by blabbing their big Steam device news to the studio ahead of time. "The day was chosen more or less randomly on our end," Lechat said. There's perhaps an argument that, depending on when it locked in that date for the big reveals, Valve could have blocked out the 12th as a no-go zone for deals, so whichever games might have been in line to be featured during it didn't end up in a battle they'd not expect.</p><p>Though, Permadeath's devs make clear that they did still get some traction out of the daily deal, despite the tough eyeball competition. A little over 5,000 copies shifted on that day, which is less than the studio hoped and apparently less than the bump in coverage when the news of the bug affecting Planet Centauri's 1.0 launch netted them when it broke a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Despite that, Lechat stressed that these sales will still aid in the studio's efforts to keep on trucking, saying: "what seems like a small amount will be a great help because it's enough for us to survive for at least a year and allow us to finish our second game, which is currently in development." That game's a 2D roguelike which'll be getting a demo when it's ready and won't be following Planet Centauri's early access path.</p>
<p>What the latter's fate in terms of further updates ends up being depends on how well its fresher sibling does. Permadeath aren't against returning to it, even if Lechat understandably has "the feeling that Planet Centauri is cursed" given just how much fun it's run into over the past year and a bit.</p>
