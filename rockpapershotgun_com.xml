            <p>Still fresh off of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">bought from Riot</a> and revived by a team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> now has an early access release date. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox emerges from the cave it's spent years exploring early next year, with pre-orders kicking off next month.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">dates</a> you'll want to circle on your calendar are January 13th, 2026, and December 13th, 2025. Yep, it seems that isn't an unlucky number in Hypixel's estimation. The first of those dates will see Hytale release in what Collins-Laflamme and co are being clear is "true early access", while the latter sees pre-orders go live at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">prices Hypixel have previously outlined</a>. So, about $20/equivalent for the base version.</p>
<p>"It’s still very much unfinished and broken, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1994430319580098783">wrote</a> of the Hytale you'll be getting if you dive in at this point. "The game isn't good yet; eventually, it will be. If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in Early Access, please don’t."</p>
<p>He added that while the decision to go back to an older build means "some parts of the game will feel behind", the now 50-strong team working on the project have momentum behind them. "Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term," the dev explained. "That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day 1. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early."</p>
<p>In summary, Collins-Laflamme declared that "the first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more" and promised more details about the release will be incoming.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of what Hytale's like at the moment, the group now helming it were quick to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">show off some footage of the game in action</a> after it was mailed over by Riot.</p>

If you've been struggling lately with the thought that everybody you interact with online is a closet serial killer, why not fire up Killer Chat, which will remove all uncertainty from your brain and flood it with delicious, sexy fear. Hitherto available on <a href="https://rosesrot.itch.io/killer-chat">Itch.io</a>, and just released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476730/Killer_Chat__Original_Edition/">Steam</a>, it casts you as a reporter researching a book on serial killers. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If it were me, I'd be watching Manhunter, but no, this reporter is the kind of snoop who accidentally joins a chatroom on the darkweb while googling "how to make ribcages decompose fast", and immediately gets cosy with users called "goreboy". You've got to pass yourself off as an embryonic Hannibal Lecter, as much for the sake of survival as to gather info for your book. And while you're getting to know this crowd, you might as well fuck a few of them. Yeah, that should pan out well. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Over the course of six in-game months, you'll rub shoulders with various extremely pretty anime murderers, catching up with them over text or videocall in a dating sim format. There are eight endings that presumably range from your character waking up dead through you calling the police to you becoming a killer yourself. Each route to the finish should take 2-3 hours. All told, you can expect 9-12 hours of slayer-slaying if you're committed to the cause. 
</p><p>
All this need cost you nothing, save the possibility of some worrying revelations about your own kinks. The base "Original" Steam edition of the game is free, having previously been crowd-funded. There are also various DLC packs and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378100/Killer_Chat__Expanded_Edition/">a forthcoming expanded edition</a> that will offer at least double the words, with over 20 possible endings. I am picturing those words scribbled all over the walls of a dingy apartment full of pickle jars. "Just his mind poured on paper," breathes an anime version of Morgan Freeman, before blowing you a kiss.

            <p>Prime Video's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> has been followed around by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-the-fallout-tv-show-hasnt-written-fallout-new-vegas-out-of-history-says-bethesda-studio-design-director">buzzing swarm of canon chatter hornets</a> since the moment its first series emerged from the vault. Such a thing's natural and healthy - people care enough about the games to have thoughts about how this adaptation portrays the world in which they take place. It goes double when when you head to locations which have played host to entries especially beloved for how much say they let the player have in how their stories play out.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Spill, Aaron Moten - the actor behind Brothehood of Steel bloke Maximus - touched on this having been something he's had chats with the show's bigwigs about. Asked whether he thinks fans will be surprised by the version of New Vegas the show's about to shoot into our skulls after taking us on a nice trip to Goodsprings' cemetery, Moten said the following:</p><p>"Actually, you know what's really interesting is our storyline, where we are in time, it's a number of years after the events of New Vegas. An interesting thing, a conversation [co-showrunner] Geneva [Robertson-Dworet] and I have been having, was actually about how history is written in the wasteland by whoever writes it. Different perspectives will have a different perspective on who won and who lost. It's a really beautiful thing. We see it really early on that you guys [Lucy and The Ghoul] find out who believes themselves to be winning, and The Ghoul offering a different perspective."</p>
<p>This meshes with what Robertson-Dworet and fellow showrunner Graham Wagner said to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-season-2-creators-interview">GQ</a> last year when asked what's happened since New Vegas in their New Vegas: "All we really want the audience to know is that things have happened, so that there isn't an expectation that we pick the show up in season two, following one of the myriad canon endings that depend on your choices when you play [Fallout: New Vegas].</p>
<p>"With that post-credits stuff, we really wanted to imply, Guys, the world has progressed, and the idea that the wasteland stays as it is decade-to-decade is preposterous to us. It’s just a place [of] constant tragedy, events, horrors — there's a constant churn of trauma. We're definitely implying more has occurred."</p>
<p>Right, so here's my view on this as someone who hasn't made a blockbuster TV show, but who has done many New Vegasings, and thus spent plenty of time making choices that whatever scenario the show depicts might well not mesh with. If I was going to take a show to New Vegas after the events of the game, I'd just <strong>pick an ending</strong>. Probably whichever one I think will fit best with whatever narrative I'm planning to weave. Show off how the events following it might have played out, or fill in some interesting blanks as to what it might mean in terms of immediate consequences for the people of the wasteland.</p><p>Odds are, some people will find that take on this optional future intriguing, and reflect on choices they've personally made when playing the game. Some people will very probably dislike it, or simply not vibe with it as much. That's fine - the video game still exists and they can fire it up at any time to run around in the version of the Mojave they've shaped. Either way, the show doesn't have to spend its entire runtime shrugging or leaning on the unreliable narrator whenever someone asks what happened at that big important battle. The one which had very clear, very high stakes that went a long way to making New Vegas' story as widely beloved as it is.</p>
<p>Then again, I don't have to live with any of the online vitriol or boardroom frowning Fallout's showrunners might have to, if they were to go this route. We'll see which route they've gone on December 17th, when No-bark Noonan heroically emerges from the Lucky 38 to negotiate the first Mojave-wide peace agreement, having gotten Mr House to sign off on a clause which dictates all real-life lore-heads won't be forced to forget every New Vegas thing they've ever done.</p>
