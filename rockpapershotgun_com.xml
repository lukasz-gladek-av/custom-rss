            <p>Rockstar have released a second trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It's one of those cinematic clip shows of scenes from the game, setting up the story and relationship between dual protagonists Jason and Lucia. It's horny and boring at the same time. Nope, there's still no word on a PC release, sorry. </p>

<p>In the video we see Jason "Do You Even Lift" Duval going to collect his partner in crime (and life) from her stint in prison. Once free, Lucia "Okay One More Butt Shot" Caminos fires many weapons, kicks people, and makes kissy faces at her criminal bae. This is all set to 1986 pop hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NnMl7NUmS8">Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them," say Rockstar on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the studio's website</a>, where they're finally sharing more about the game's story. "But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida â€” forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."</p>
<p>Other characters include conspiracy theorist pal Cal Hampton (basically Jack Black), bank robber Raul Bautista, gangster-to-musician Dre'Quan Priest, and two social media rappers known as Real Dimez. The developers have dumped a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">ton of screenshots</a> of these characters and more.</p>
<p>The trailer follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">the game's recent delay</a>, which pushed the open world crime sim's release date back to May 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
