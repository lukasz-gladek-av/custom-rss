<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> are cooking. I'm not exactly sure what just yet, but there's a faint aroma of a new game in the air, and it doesn't seem like they're ready to share anything about the game right now either. Still, after the runaway success of Helldivers 2, something new from the studio is still an exciting prospect. Interestingly enough though, whatever they're making, it won't have anything to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">PlayStation</a> when it comes to funding.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Arrowhead's CEO Shams Jorjani recently shared on Helldivers 2's official Discord (cheers, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">Forbes</a>) that, thanks to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's success, their next game will be fully self-funded. "The wonderful thing is that thanks to the amazing support of you FINE people Arrowhead's future is quite bright and we have the freedom to explore some really cool concepts that we couldn't have otherwise. Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you," wrote Jorjani.
</p>
<p>
After one member of the server asked for whatever said next game is to be available in all regions, Jorjani explained that "the next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." For some context, PlayStation tried to make it so that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">needed a PSN account to play Helldivers 2</a> on PC last year, but that went down so badly they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement</a>. However, that did lead to the game being pulled from sale in a number of countries where PSN isn't available, presumably why the comment was made by said Discord member.
</p>
<p>
To be clear though, it doesn't sound like Arrowhead's relationship with PlayStation has gone sour, as Jorjani said that the company is "great" and that "there would be no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> if it wasn't for them. We're open to working with them again in the future. They are incredibly game/dev oriented. Solid partners. And this is me just saying it like it is. Not blowing smoke up their asses."
</p>
<p>
I'm sure whatever Arrowhead make next will be on PlayStation either way, but that doesn't really matter to us here does it? Personally, it's just nice to know they'll be able to do things their own way, and not lock out a huge number of people from playing a game for such a ridiculously arbitrary reason.

        <p>"What happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone?"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
That Hideo Kojima is a bit of an odd chap, 'ey? It was only recently he said that he wants to make a game where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-proposes-a-game-where-the-protagonist-forgets-abilities-if-players-take-too-long-a-break">protagonist forgets their own abilities if you, the player, take a long break between play sessions</a>. As a reminder this comes from the guy who made a whole game about delivering packages, another game where a character can die of old age if you wait long enough, and another game that knows if you've played Castlevania or not. The guy likes doing things differently!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
He also, in more recent years, seems to be thinking a lot about his own mortality. In a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/">VGC</a>), the acclaimed game maker spoke of how his experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic shaped not only his games, but his own legacy and company. "Turning 60 was less of a turning point in my life than my experiences during the pandemic," Kojima explained. "I fell seriously ill at that time, and also had an eye operation. Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live.
</p>
<p>
"But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, ‘Wait, how many years do I have left to make a game or a film?’ Perhaps I have ten years?"
</p>
<p>
In turn, Kojima has apparently be rethinking his own priorities, for example wondering whether or not he should try to make a movie (Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn, both seen but not heard in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, apparently advised him to stick to games, something I'm inclined to agree with).
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most existential of all though, he has a plan for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kojima-productions">Kojima Productions</a> after his death. "I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will. Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions…" Kojima explained. "This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP."
</p>
<p>
Obviously I wasn't there for this interview, but it sounds like there's a real earnest concern from Kojima here. I wouldn't want Kojima Productions to just rehash his own work either. Would love to know what's on that drive though… how much money do you want to be on there being a pitch for a game that plays you?

Fancy a jaunt back into The Zone? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> released the long awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> last November, steadling improving it after an (understandably) rocky launch. There's been several hefty updates for the sequel released along the way, and it turns out the developer has been even busier than expected. GSC Game World announced Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition today, a revamp of the original three games, Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, that mostly brings in some visual upgrades.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on an <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">FAQ</a> about the update, GSC explained that these improvements include things like enhancements to GodRays and the overall lighting system, refined surface reflections, improved 3D models for NPCs and guns, and even things like updated skyboxes. Textures have seen some upscaling too, and some aspects of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> UI has been updated to "improve usability" on both PC and console.

<p>
While they didn't specify what, there have been some tweaks to the controls to make them "more in line with current game practices" and there's some new quality of life features too, whatever they are. Full controller support is being added, and Steam Deck users will probably be happy to hear all three games have been optimised for the handheld. And there'll be cloud saves now too!
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it certainly all looks newer. I never feel particularly passionate about lighting "upgrades" like this, the vibes often feel just a little bit too different. Mostly I miss the days when games didn't have real-time lighting, a lot of games just kind of look the same now. Ah well, at least the base of it is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
This new update is coming May 20th, just a few days away, and for some added good news, this'll be a free update. The revamped version of the individual games will be listed separately in your library, so if you're averse to the modern world, you'll still be able to play as normal. Happy zoning!
