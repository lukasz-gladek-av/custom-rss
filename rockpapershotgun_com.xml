            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/iracing">iRacing</a>'s always scared me a bit.

<p>"Funlop", reads the parody-centric text scrawled across a bridge over the game's version of the Japanese Tsukuba Circuit. To be honest, the simple fact developers Original Fire Games and iRacing have opted for a classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> track as the venue for the single Porsche one-make race which makes up the Next Fest demo had me 90% sold before I'd even turned a wheel.</p><p>First up was a two-lap qualifying session, with each 911 out on track at the same time, but separated by intervals. As I quickly found out, getting close to another car in one of these sessions just sees it turn into a ghost to prevent collisions, so even if you race up to those in front, there's no danger of being blocked. However, you can very much get a track limits penalty which slaps you with a temporary forced slowdown period as punishment for your corner cutting. It's a reminder in case you needed one that this is still iRacing, so you'd better locate the brake pedal rather than trying to bounce at full speed off of walls, sonny Jim.</p>
<p>Provided you keep it between the lines, driving the licensed GT racer with a controller is brilliant. The model's a cute mini-me of a full-size 911, but packs the same punchy soundtrack of straight-six screaming. It feels great to fling into one of Tsukuba's tight hairpins, and tricky to balance on the edge of adhesion as you try to maximise velocity through the flowing chicane midway through the lap or hang on for dear life through the sweeping right of the final corner.</p>
<p>Once the grid's decided, it's on into a six lap race, which sadly doesn't allow you to test out the cartoon pit crews standing vigilant watch along the pit lane. To be fair, Tsukuba's a less than 30 second tour in a iRacing Arcade's Porsches, so there's hardly enough tyre wear in this length of sprint to warrant fresh rubber. Things get nice and chaotic right away if you're running mid-pack, with the AI drivers glomming together like swarms of hornets to try and dice your way through.</p>
<p>Shhh. Come here so I can whisper this without big iRacing hearing. You can drive into people. You won't get penalised. Each minor hit will only cost you a single one of your car's very generous hundred health points. These bumps and scraps are nowhere near as satisfying or played up as they are in more anarchic arcade racers, only offering a dull thunk resulting in little to no visible damage on contact, but this is progress. Who knows, in ten years time we might get iRacing's take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>.</p><p>Admittedly having not double checked the assigned handbrake button, I also couldn't manage to get the rear-wheel-drive racer drifting all that much. Please keep that quiet too, I don't want to get a letter in the post which reads 'LOOK AFTER YOUR TYRES. GRAINING, MARBLES, CONTACT PATCHES, SIDEWALLS. DO THESE HOLY TERMS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU, HEATHEN?'. I apologise, o racers of the lowercase i. </p>
<p>iRacing Arcade's due to release on December 2nd this year, and you can grab the keys to its Next Fest demo from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226450/iRacing_Arcade/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <p>Huh. It turns out Quantic Dream, makers of such decision-heavy dramas as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, haven’t just been tinkering with their long-teased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars: Eclipse</a>. They’re also taking a sharp turn into competitive multiplayer, announcing Spellcasters Chronicles: a 3v3, third-person, free-to-play MOBA full of aerial magefights and big stompy demon lads. <em>Huh</em>.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine a starker departure from the studio’s previous work, or a riskier one. The modern Multiplayer Online Battle Arena isn’t so much a genre as a graveyard, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> ambling around and occasionally sharing a knowing look between the headstones. Still, Spellcasters Chronicles seems determined to try, offering shorter, punchier matches and bigger maelstroms of hero-shooter spectacle.</p>

<p>To wit, everyone can fly. Everyone, from the gothy shamans to the vaguely Druidic witches that make up the game’s roster of multicultural magic-spewers. While the map looks like a fairly conventional three-lane affair, Spellcasters Chronicles encourages zip-zooping through the air above, three-dimensionally duelling other players, and raining down an assortment of (often screen-filling) arcane attacks on creeps.</p>
<p>Summoning your own minions is a focus as well. Capturing territories affords you more opportunities to call forth a powerful familiar, like the Astral Monk’s battle elephant, and eventually, players can spawn even bigger beasts called Titans: magic kaiju that will rampage down a lane unless stopped by either massive combined firepower or, more likely, an opposing Titan. At which point the objective effectively shifts from lane dominance to a noisy game of wizard conkers, buffing your own big guy to punch harder while chipping away at the other big guy’s health.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another novelty is the deckbuilding element to spell loadouts. Characters fit into archetypes – tank, support, or damage dealer – but you can customise their skills (and summons) before each match, choosing from abilities and monsters that you’ve unlocked in previous battles. This is also where Spellcasters Chronicles draws its tactical flexibility, as although there’s no shopping system to gain strength through items, min-maxing spell upgrades can still create distinct builds to press a character’s natural advantages or counter those of an enemy.</p><p>It's still all very strange to be witnessing this stuff in a Quantic Dream game, though the studio claim that Spellcasters Chronicles will still have some kind of meaningful narrative across its season. And that, in places, it may even branch out in response to player decisions. How, exactly, remains vague: game director Gregorie Diaconu says that "Spellcasters Chronicles began as a creative experiment, an opportunity to channel our passion for storytelling into a shared, living world. While very different from our previous titles, it builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories - this time in a collective manner." Which doesn’t explain much.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A blurb I found elsewhere in the announcement paperwork is slightly clearer, stating that "Each season, you will face a choice that impacts the gameplay and lore of the game." I still don’t know how that’d be executed as a series of "collective" choices – voting, maybe? Storytelling by democracy? Not sure about that, no sir. I’ve spent thousands of hours around Dota players and am convinced most of us shouldn’t even be allowed to choose when we leave the house.</p>
<p>I’m also not sure what Spellcasters Chronicles’ chances are in a corner of online play that’s hard enough to break into, let alone survive in. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is already doing the highly mobile, third-person MOBA thing, and besides Valve pedigree, that offers a generally more interesting and distinctive world than what so far seems like just another broadly-defined fantasy setting. And while the sense of scale looks impressive, especially with two Titans slapping each other about, I worry that summons might be a little <em>too</em> important: a good MOBA satisfies when you gain mastery of your hero, not when you run backup for an AI entity so it can win the game for you.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Still, I haven’t played the thing. Frankly I haven’t played Deadlock in months either, so maybe deep down I’m just a puritan codger who thinks MOBAs should stay top-down like God intended. No release date for Spellcasters Chronicles yet but a closed beta is planned for sometime later this year.</p><p>Both this and Star Wars: Eclipse come as Quantic Dream try to patch together some goodwill, following French media reports in 2018 of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">abusive workplace behaviour</a> and financial irregularities at the Paris-headquartered studio. As our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/quantic-dream-wins-one-libel-case-loses-another">GI.biz</a> reported in 2021, co-founders Guillaume de Fondaumière and David Cage successfully sued newspaper Le Monde for libel, but lost a similar case against Mediapart after the court ruled that the journalists involved "had, for each of the accusations, enough factual evidence."</p>

            <p>
Unionised EA workers and senators have spoken out against the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> publisher's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recently announced acquisition by US and Saudi-backed investors</a>, which (assuming it's approved by regulators) will leave the resulting privately-owned EA with a $20 billion debt. The two sets of complainants appear equally cheesed-off, but for mostly different reasons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a statement shared with RPS and other sites, the United Videogame Workers-CWA - a direct-join union that spans the whole US and Canadian games industry - criticised company management for neglecting to consult EA workers and risking future mass layoffs as the new owners scrape to pay off the bank.</p>
<p>They note that EA was prosperous prior to the acquisition, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">previous rounds of job cuts</a> notwithstanding, and conclude that "if jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".
</p>
<p>
"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.

"We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation," the union statement adds. This could be an allusion to studios like BioWare, who have an outsized cultural influence but have struggled to meet EA's financial hopes - a former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive has suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">BioWare could be gutted, sold off or even closed</a> by the acquiring consortium.

"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," the statement continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."

tldr: Gondor cries for aid. And Rohan will answer! Though more because they're worried about Saudi Arabia's rulers having their fingers in another pie, than because they're concerned about potential job losses. In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">public letters</a> to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson earlier this week, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren called for a public investigation of "the foreign influence and national security risks" of flogging a major US games publisher to a group that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. 
</p><p>
Warren and Blumenthal offer the familiar argument that the PIF's investment - which will give it a majority stake in the firm, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">according to the Financial Times</a> - is about improving Saudi Arabia's repressive and authoritarian public image and extending its influence overseas. 
</p>
<p>
The senators suggest that Saudi Arabia might use access to EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda purposes, and are concerned about what the country's rulers might do with EA's proprietary generative AI technologies (which have reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">been deemed crucial to paying off that staggering loan</a>). They allege that Affinity Partners founder Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, is only involved with the transaction to ensure that it gets past the US regulators.

<p>
Finally, they note that as a private company, EA would no longer be obliged to report their financial status and plans to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Warren and Blumenthal fear this will allow the new bosses to get up to all kinds of anti-American shenanigans behind the scenes.
</p><p>
"The PIF's control over EA's operations could extend to influencing or directing the company's design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government's specific and long-term objectives," the senators write. "PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government's ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide."
</p>
<p>
I can see the argument that Saudi Arabia's investments in videogames are designed to deflect criticism of its terrible human rights record and clean up its profile overseas. It's also hard to deny the proposed sneaky logic behind Kushner's involvement. I have to say, though, the alarm over Saudi Arabia potentially "controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture" makes my eyes roll back into my head. The US entertainment industry has global reach, and examples of powerful American media publishers creating slanted representations of other cultures aren't exactly rare.

EA's own Battlefield 6, for example, explicitly lumps together thinly referenced geopolitical aggressors into one all-purpose US-hating bogeyman, washing its hands of their distinctions. Admittedly, the story does portray said bogeyman as a monster of the USA's cultivation, but that's a cheap and belated piece of self-reflexivity that is never seriously explored. Read all about it in my swivel-eyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6 review</a>.

<p>The letter from Warren and Blumenthal doesn't touch on any of the concerns shared by the unionised games industry workers in their own appeal for greater scrutiny of the deal. Being a mucky old Limey, I'm not particularly familiar with the political background here, but both senators appear to be pro-union - perhaps they and the United Videogame Workers-CWA should get in touch.</p>
