            <p>We last wrote about immersive sim sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 3 back in 2020, when then-developers Otherside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-take-over-system-shock-3">sold the franchise to megapublisher Tencent</a>. Development of the series later passed to remaster specialists Nightdive Studios, who’ve already overhauled the first game and are currently working on a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> for release in June.</p>
<p>Now, NightDive have popped up with news that the System Shock 3 project survives, in some form, and that we could get clarification as to its status “potentially within a year”. Don’t call it a comeback, do call it a sign of life.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated,” Nightdive’s director of business development Larry Kuperman hedged at GDC this week, in comments published by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">VGC</a>. </p>
<p>Can we expect a proper update anytime soon? “Not as yet, not as yet,” Kuperman went on. “I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year. It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see a remaster of System Shock 2,” he added. “I’ve been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake, and I said, ‘are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won’t be able to do a remake in the future?’ That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there’s going to be content coming out.”</p>
<p>So there’s your bonus headline here: Nightdive might do a System Shock 2 remake after the remaster. Asked about the future of the series beyond retreads of the existing games, Kuperman said: “We’ll see what happens. I mean, there’s stuff that we can do within the first and the second.” Some expansions then?</p>
<p>It’s all very… non-enlightening. But I’m happy with any sign that System Shock has a future beyond high-fi retreads of the classics, and Nightdive seem like they could hack a threequel. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of their System Shock remake</a>, Jeremy Peel called it “a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design.”</p>
<p>Jeremy’s also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-system-shock-2-made-stephen-kick-and-nightdive-studios%E2%80%9D">an interview with Nightdive</a> detailing how the studio got their hands on the license, beginning with a phone chat with an insurance conversation and ending with Nightdive’s acquisition by Atari.</p>
<p>As for Otherside – the studio co-founded by original System Shock devs Paul Neurath and Warren Spector - they’re currently working on a new immersive sim, Thick As Thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I think the idea of a chill, cosy, and/or “Zen” factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> is among the most pernicious to ever dribble from a game developer’s earhole, but I can’t deny how... soothing it can be to look down on a world of symmetrically nested conveyor belts. At least till your iron smelting district backs up. Modulus seems zouper-douper Zen. It also has a pleasing consistency: in this factory game, you shape and manufacture pieces for buildings which, as far as I can tell from the devlog below, can then be used to manufacture pieces for other buildings.

These building parts aren’t generic, liquid resources that magically add up into an airport or similar, once you’ve met the requirements. You can trace them within the architecture of the resulting construction. Rather than growing them from a given recipe, you’ll also sculpt these building parts from clumps of smaller cubes. You can venture inside each production facility to rotate, colour, stamp and trim these cubes to satisfaction, a mechanic that reminds me distantly of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries of Titan</a>, but without the accumulating e-waste.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is quite nice. It helps that the world you’re building factories in is a blend of pearly iPod paving stones and verdant plastic greenery. Very calming. Nicely... lacking in things besides factories.
</p>
<p>
“There are no timers, no enemies—just you and your factory,” adds the Steam page. “Relax and find your flow as you build at your own pace. Watch your factory expand, with monumental buildings emerging to meet the ever growing demand from The Grand Neural Network.” That last part sounds a little ominous. Still, I’m sure “ever growing demand” won’t cause any difficulties as long as the resources available to me are also “ever growing”. Incidentally, are there any animals in this world? Any people? Ah, no matter.
</p>
<p>
There’s a demo for Modulus in the works for 3rd April. It will encompass an estimated two hours of playtime, though it’s fundamentally “only limited in factory floor size.” It’ll also have an objective-free "Zen" mode and a tutorial. I guess I could have waited till the demo launch to write this up, but it’s a slow news day – it was either this or write about some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> nonsense. Besides, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779120/Modulus/">you can sign up for the Modulus playtest right now on Steam</a>.
