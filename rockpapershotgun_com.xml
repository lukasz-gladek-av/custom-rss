Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I guess chopping off horns and tails in the preceding fight counts as "butchery", but this process is quite stagey too, somewhat scripted, a little bit... canned. Ugh, I am getting lost in the permutations. I no longer know how to make this metaphor work. Like a hunter fleeing a Rathalos that was actually only <em>playing</em> dead, I must make a terrified leap to the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
The news comes via Capcom's <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">German Xitter account</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements">Eurogamer</a>, who note that Monster Hunter Wilds' existing PC system specs have "raised a few eyebrows" - especially given the last beta's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buggy-monsters-in-monster-hunter-wilds-have-sparked-a-wave-of-low-poly-animal-adoration">slight tendency to make the monsters look like angry Dali paintings</a>. Capcom say they're focussing on the game's recommended GPU requirements, while also trying to improve performance. Here's a screenshot of the current PC specs from Steam, for context.

Seeking guidance from the gods, I ran those specs by our hardware editor James. Our remote-working format made it impossible to ascertain whether his eyebrows were raised, but he didn't seem to think the requirements were excessive. He did suggest that 140GB was quite a lot of SSD space, and that the recommended specs only allowing for 60 FPS with frame generation is a bit weird. And that the minimum GPU requirement is on the beefy side. Me, I'm still goggling at 16GB of RAM. I hear this is pretty standard nowadays, for a game with all three "A"s, but in my head, 8GB is still the norm for minimum spec.
</p><p>
I'm interested to know what you all think should be the minimum and recommended specs for a game of Monster Hunter Wilds stature right now. Both in terms of your own setups, and more abstractly in terms of what you consider a fair price for all those frames and pixels. Come, let us explore this vexing question as in the proverb about the blind men feeling their way around the elephant, trying to ascertain its complete form. Wait a minute, this elephant has wings. It's that bloody Rathalos again.

            <p>One piece of worldbuilding advice I've always found useful is to go at least one level deeper than the obvious. To wit: why have a lantern, asks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mohrta">Mohrta</a>, when you can have a horrible vulture-esque creature called a lantern beast that lives on your head to light up the dark for you? "Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/">Steam demo</a>. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.</p>

<p>It's a world of stumpy, cowbell-wearing pet giraffes and ferocious avian nightmare bastards. These aren't things I'm used to dealing with on daily basis, so I naturally sought something to ground myself. Luckily, you start with a very nice, comfortingly chunky pistol with an excellent alt fire that unloads a full clip at whatever you're pointing at. Your sword also has an alt fire, as all good swords should. These use mana, which you can restore with a big sippy from your flask. And so you progress. Looking at things and going "oh yeah, that's cool", shooting very fast things that want you dead, and taking big sippies.</p>
<p>Between the vaguely futuristic modern and medieval bits, and the very strange horse your character rides, my mind naturally went straight to Wolfe's Book Of The New Sun. This is likely more recency bias than anything else, but there's definitely a sense of thick, somewhat pulpy history to the world, and I'm very curious to find out more about it. What's interesting is how the lore blurb would fit equally well for a modern military shooter, albeit one with a few supernatural elements:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A special military group known as "The Hayward" was formed to investigate and destroy the anomalies within The Strange. For years, the Hayward had done an admirable job of monitoring, handling, and reverse-engineering elements of the Great Strange into their work. Among these Hayward operatives is where your remains found new life."</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll often hear people say "graphics don't matter", but rarely the same about features. I must then conclude that most people care about features. As such, here are Mohrta's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adventure through an atypical take on the FPS genre.</li>
<li>Play through the game's five enormous and differently-themed dimensions in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Soak in the otherworldly atmosphere and lovingly-crafted level design.</li>
<li>Fight though a myriad of highly-detailed environments that push the limits of GZDoom.</li>
<li>Explore unusual settings, characters, and enemies fleshed out in beautiful signature Scumhead detail, featuring designs by Osiol.</li>
<li>Acquire a huge roster of weapons, each with multiple functions and utility.</li>
<li>Upgrade your weapons and gear, and choose a custom loadout that best suits your playstyle.</li>
<li>Over 50 diverse enemies and 20 challenging boss fights to dodge, shoot, and strike through.</li>
<li>Befriend a huge cast of strange and loveable NPCs, each with their own quests and storylines.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This one's out sometime this year. It's from Oisol and Scumhead, who did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-like-short-steampunk-snes-style-rpgs-give-dystopian-freebie-franzen-a-shot">Franzen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
