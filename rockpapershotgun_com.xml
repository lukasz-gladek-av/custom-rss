            <p>While prowling the ramparts of this year's Summer Game Fest, I rode a zipline to a broken attic window and snuck into a sealed chamber containing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick As Thieves</a>, the unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> Thief game from Otherside Entertainment. Also in the sealed chamber: celebrated Looking Glass dude and Deus Exman Warren Spector, who walked us through a hands-off demo of the PvPvE heisting sim.</p>
<p>I didn't, if I'm honest, see much that wasn't broadly covered by Jeremy Peel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">write-up of Thick As Thieves from last December</a>. As such, I'm in two minds about whether to do a full impressions piece - this news article is testing the waters. But I did turn up a few objects of novelty. For one, the new multiplayer burgling sim features an ability that lets you pose temporarily as an NPC, as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/semblance">Semblance</a> power in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>: Death Of The Outsider. For another, it turns out that when you rob a joint, you can leave a knavish calling card for other players hunting the same treasure. </p>
<p>It's possible, Spector told me, that you'll be able to customise your calling cards, beyond just displaying your player alias. Being a fundamentally vindictive person, I already have a few ideas for what I'd write on mine.</p>
<blockquote><p>[placeholder]</p>
<p>The earlier bird caught the worm.</p>
<p>The second mouse did not get the cheese.</p>
<p>The third anteater did not bag the swag.</p>
<p>The fourth raccoon did not scoop the loot.</p>
<p>You snoozed and you losed.</p>
<p>Opportunity knocked.</p>
<p>The real treasure was hopefully the friends you made along the way.</p>
<p>IOU one quest reward</p>
<p>Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll.</p>
<p>Behind you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, a topic like this demands the attention of the full Treehouse. I asked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-hello-to-mark-warren-rpss-new-senior-staff-writer">recently recruited</a> newsfiend Mark what he'd put on his card, and he suggested transcribing the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria37d9mInY">this Seinfield video</a> into the textbox. James, our hardware Gandalf, came back with "didn't expect weak foe". Reviews reassembler Brendy had the pithiest and, I think, most obnoxious proposal: "first".</p>
<p>But you, reader dear - what would you leave on your catburgling calling card?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Some raw footage has leaked of a cinematic moment in Battlefield 6 (or Battlefield Now, or Battlefield Big War, or whatever Electronic Arts are planning to call their next western military interventionism sim). The video sees the player escaping from a collapsing dam at the last minute as bomber jets launch a payload at the big concrete waterstopper. The footage is silent, but you can insert the manly yells of "Go! Go! Go!" easily enough yourself. Perhaps more interestingly, the same leaker also provides evidence of a battle royale mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The footage was <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">posted on social media</a> by data miner "temporyal", who has been going through the files of the Battlefield Labs playtest client, uncovering various details. It's a very early block-out of what may become a more detailed escapade during a campaign mission, or perhaps the early workings of a trailer - who knows. Either way, there's lots of greybox geometry, placeholder props, and unfinished animations. Kind of like watching theatre actors perform a rehearsal wearing their jogger bottoms, script in hand. But it does give you a sense of scale, and it's a reminder that EA remain obsessed with big chunks of world infrastructure falling on top of people.</p>
<p>It's not the only thing the leaker claims to have uncovered in their spelunk down the data mines. They've also posted <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935676264565862641">images and blurbs</a> which suggest there will be a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1kti0m0/bf_labs_datamining_the_battle_royale_mode_new/">battle royale mode</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a> had a battle royale mode called "Firestorm" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> had a not-quite-battle-royale mode called "Hazard Zone". I'm curious to see if they go trad royale with this one or add some sort of battlespice, if this mode does materialise.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1925897904956362807">lore tidbits</a> that could mean maps set in New York and Turkmenistan. As for the campaign, the miner is <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">convinced</a> we'll see missions taking place in various countries "including Egypt, Tajikistan, the USA, and Gibraltar". </p>
<p>But of course, all this comes deep from the guts of the game's current playtesting client. There's no guarantee such things will surface in the finished game. Bits of lore and other narrative text can be easily misinterpreted, and none of it is officially confirmed by EA, who have yet to reveal more details about the game. They are planning to show off a no doubt explodey trailer with more information sometime this summer, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">according to EA comms director Andy McNamara</a>.  

</p><p>This isn't the first leak of footage from the shooter. Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">call for playtesters</a> early this year, some nine minutes of multiplayer footage showing the series' long-running conquest mode were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaked from those playtests</a>. There are tanks and drones and medics, oh my.</p>
<p>It is looking traditionally shooty so far. Battlefield 2042, the last game of the series, was not particularly well-received among fans of bigwar, many of whom complained that it was not fully polished on release, full of bugs and instabilities. In his review, our Ed called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">"an FPS that doesn't feel ready yet".</a> That'll be why EA is going so hard on playtesting this one then.</p>
