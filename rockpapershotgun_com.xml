            <p>
It is not news to anyone that Nightdive Studios' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake took a while to make. The remake started development in 2015, with a successful Kickstarter project held for it the following year. After a few engine changes and attempts at making the thing, it finally released back in 2023, a good eight years after development had started. But such a long wait is absolutely not worth calling the FBI over, folks, are we being serious right now? Which is, apparently, a thing that happened to Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/system-shock-remake-lead-couldnt-sleep-due-to-the-mass-vitriol-from-fans-reported-to-the-irs-fb/">FRVR</a>, game director Stephen Kick spoke of the stress that came from working on the project and the large swathe of vitriolic comments targeted directly at him. "That was a really rough point in my life," Kick explained. "I took a lot of that very personally because we had built up a considerable amount of just community respect and admiration, so much so that many people were willing to risk a not-insignificant amount of money on a project that I knew we were capable of doing."
</p>
<p>
It wasn't just some comments left on the game's Kickstarter page or across the studio's social pages. Kick notes that he "was threatened with lawsuits, any matter of things you could do to somebody." He explained further, "We got reported to the IRS and the FBI. It was awful. There was probably a good month and a half where I could not sleep at night because of the weight of everything that had some down on the company."
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm really not sure a video game you're excited about is worth calling the FBI over. Right? Am I the one who's lost their marbles here? In any case, even if it took a while, the System Shock remake did come out, and RPS contributor Jeremy Peel even gave it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">coveted RPS Bestest Bests award</a>. So, it seems like the wait was probably worth it!

            <p>If you've ever wanted to spend somewhere in the region of $67/£50 to turn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> into a fishing simulator, today's your lucky day. <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">Rockstar-partnered GTA roleplaying server operators</a> Cfx.re - the folks behind FiveM and RedM - have launched the Cfx Marketplace, a store where you can buy a bunch of GTA roleplaying mods, some of which are free and some of which seem pretty damn expensive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to its <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289">announcement post</a>, the Cfx Marketplace is designed to server as "a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work. Featuring purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more, there’s something for every server and every player." So, something along the lines of Bethesda's various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creation-club-is-bethesdas-alternative-to-paid-mods">Creations/Bethesda.net initiatives</a>, where modders' works are hosted somewhere that has the official seal of approval, rather than third-party modding sites.</p>
<p>Let's see what you can grab to trick out your GTA 5 experience he...wait. It'll cost me how much to turn GTA into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a>? $67.19, which is just under £50, for modder Lixeiro Charmoso's <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222299-trucker-simulator">Trucker Simulator</a>. To be fair, it's clearly a detailed truck simming experience and getting such things running on a GTA roleplaying server probably isn't easy, but as someone who's not familiar with GTA roleplaying mod prices, woof. For context, the base version of ETS2 will set you back £16.89 assuming you don't buy it in a sale. It's currently in such a sale, lowering the price to £4.22/$4.99. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, meanwhile, is exactly the same price sans DLC.</p>
<p>A GTA roleplaying mod which turns the game <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222309-fishing-simulator">into a fishing simulator</a> will set you back the same price as the truck sim mod, while a <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7219969-drugs-bundle">bundle</a> by another modder which allows you to manufacture meth, cocaine and weed runs to $131.99/around £98 altogether. That said, there are some less expensive or free mods on the store too, such as one that gives <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6715119-lc-fuel">every car realistic fuel consumption</a>, so you have to stop to fill up regularly.</p><p>On the one hand, you'd hope that buying these from a Rockstar-affiliated store would at least guarantee you getting the bang for your buck you're promised, something a payment made to a third-party site or random person in a Discord server doesn't necessarily provide absolute security of. On the other, those prices aren't cheap, and it's rather ironic to see Rockstar/Take-Two's relative about-face after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">warring</a> with various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">GTA</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">modders</a> end up in something like this.</p>
<p>That's not to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">the other elephant in the room</a> at the moment when it comes to whether you might be open to spending cash on a service backed by the company behind GTA 6, even if it's not clear how much of a cut - if any - said company get from Cfx Marketplace purchases.</p>

A position I take that is quite hard to explain in any way that is actually helpful is that for a game to catch someone's attention it must have aesthetic sensibilities that no other game has. To truly get someone's attention anyway, enough marketing budget can undo that, but for an indie game, a vibe (mysterious, unquantifiable) that I haven't felt before will pull me in quicker than listing off genre conventions it follows. This is how Hypnos, a first-person adventure and exploration game "set in a lovecraftian megastructure fever dream," got me to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
I cannot really tell you what Hypnos is about, the description for it is a touch too vague. You're wandering around the "Nameless City at the edge of Dreams," you gotta follow a trailer to a Holy Mountain embrace your destiny, yada, yada, yada, none of this tells me even what I'm doing mechanically. However! The world on display in its reveal trailer is enough to convince me. Jaggedy, mountainous dead landscapes, possible places of worship still active, but for what.

<p>
There's a quality that feels like it belongs both in the past, and in the future. At one point a gothic streetlamp glows upon two pigs and a piglet just… hanging out. It feels like it draws upon the classics like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and Ico, and the character art over on the Steam page tickles me just so too. There are apparently different endings to the game, different dialogue paths to go down and choices to make in its "semi-open world." That use of semi has me curious too, as I like an open world that knows when to scale things down.
</p><p>
According to a press release the game is set in a world originally created for a TTRPG, so I wonder how that may come across too. A demo will also supposedly be coming in the next few weeks, so you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be checking that out whenever it arrives. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861210/HYPNOS/">here</a>.

            <p>As someone who admittedly struggles to feel at home whenever I try to go back and play the older Elder Scrolls entries, I'm surprised how fun I've found reading through some notes from a D&amp;D game some devs on the series played around the time of Daggerfall's development. Said notes have just been made public following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died">recent death of Julian LeFay</a>, a key figure in the early days of Bethesda, who hosted this freshly unearthed campaign and another more well-known one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/julian-lefays-dd-notes">Scans of the notes</a> have been published by the Elder Scrolls lore buffs at long-running wikis the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages and The Imperial Library. "The following documents were recovered from the estate of the late Julian LeFay with great care given to help preserve them by his family and the TES Community," a librarian at the latter wrote. "With the permission of Julian’s family and Bethesda we wish to dedicate this page to Julian Lefay and his impact on The Elder Scrolls and the wider community."</p>
<p>The lore buffs write added that both of these campaigns LeFay ran - dubbed Sumurset and Dwynnen respectively - "helped to shape much of the early lore as the history of Tamriel was being laid out". The Dwynnen one appears to have been known of for a while, but the one set in Sumurset was only discovered via these newly published notes.</p>

</span></p><p>While the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks plan to put up a post at some point this week delving deeper into what the notes mean, they're well worth having a scroll through as is if, like me, you've spent a not insubstantial chunk of your life elder scrolling. Among the masses of character bios you'd expect from any D&amp;D adventure, the hand-drawn maps were among the first things which caught my eye. There's one of the isles of Auridon and Alinor with major cities labelled, and I was surprised how closely it mirrors <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/maps-summerset-isles">more modern Elder Scrolls maps</a> of the region, given major tweaks like <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil#cite_note-POT-5">Cyrodill no longer being full of jungle</a> have been worked into the lore in the decades since LeFay's campaign.</p><p>From a character perspective, the notes on Mages Guild founder Vanus Galerion are an intriguing read, with his role as one of the main player characters in this campaign seemingly having set a lot of his backstory in stone. There's one page which simply lays out his origins, with a single handwritten note next to that blurb asking the eternal question: "How about a witch in the wood?" There's also a list of Vanus' mates and where they live, which I'm hopeful no-one hands to would-be mage blackmailers.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a bunch of descriptions of Altmer royals and barons have reminded me how much fun could be had messing with snooty High Elven toffs if a future single-player Elder Scroll was to be set there, as I have with Oblivion's litany of potato-faced Imperial nobles. "Ill-natured and mean-spirited, absolutely everybody hates him," reads the opening line about a baron called Alastor. "He, however, doesn't care since he is very powerful." What a guy. You can almost hear the Dark Brotherhood contract being written up.</p>
<p>Then, there's Deryk. "This baron has a twin sister with whom he constantly wars for possession of the barony. For one hundred years they’ve fought, sometimes he reigns at the end and sometimes she. There is a rather lavish prison on the outskirts of the barony wherein the loser is usually held. For a period of twenty years they jointly ruled, but the result was disastrous." There's a quest you could solve by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccBQZVpVvAE">gently placing buckets</a> over each of their heads so they can no longer detect they're ruling alongside each other.</p>
<p>Even if you're not thinking about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">GTA-sized Turkey Bethesda have had in the oven</a> for ages as you read them, the notes are a really nice way of helping folks remember LeFay's contributions to the series, so it's wonderful to see them being preserved for prosperity like this.</p>
