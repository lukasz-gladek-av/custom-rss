            <p>Are you sitting down, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>? It's alright. I've just got...some news I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this. A modder's decided to put a bunch of Fortnitey emotes and dances inside you.</p>
<p>We can see the likes of dabs, the NaeNae, and even a stanky legg on the scans. They're cranking it, spanking that, and Snoop Dogging all over your internal organs too. There's nothing we could have done. That surgery which ported you from 2006 to 2025 increased the risk of this drastically, but how else were 12 year olds supposed to learn about the need to CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We could rage against the cause of these symptoms, modder CosmicBoogaloo with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/5039?tab=description">Dance and Emote Animation Pack</a>. We could curse them in the name of the divines, of the Aedra, or even the Daedra. We could subjugate ourselves before Dagon himself, calling on his lust for revolution to grant us the malign powers required to reverse this regrettable chain of events.</p>
<p>We could crusade with the fury of Pelinal Whitestrake against any and all who download the mod, and go on to press one of the keys it assigns a Fortnitey dance or emote to. We could cast their characters, mid-subtle dab or weird bottomless twerk, into the fiery pits of The Deadlands, where they'd inevitably float around going 'UGGGH', 'OOOOAGGHH', and 'NYYYYUUGGHHH'.</p>

<p>We could outlaw its 19 emotes and 20 dances, including the ability to make it rain despite the fact that this province lacks paper money and criss crosses you can dougie into a running man before movin' like Bernie. We could instruct every legion guard to stop violators of this anti-taunting legislation with deadly force. We could yell from the summit of the White-Gold Tower: 'You there in the Arena district, cease flexing those muscles and woohooing at once, or else incur the wrath of mighty Akatosh!'</p>
<p>We could do all of that, but it wouldn't matter. Those who wish to use this profane mod have likely already grabbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/UE4SS%20for%20Oblivion%20Remastered">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1172">Simple BP Mod Loader</a>. </p>
<p>The dabbage is irreversible.</p>

            <p>Are you from the UK and partial to risque adult Steam games, such as Amarillo's Butt Slapper - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> of Butt Slapping - or the timelessly iconic MILFs of Sunville? Bad! Naughty! GO DIRECTLY TO BED. Unless you have a valid credit card. Steam have begun rolling out a requirement for all UK-based users to verify their ages, if they wish to access store pages for games rated mature.</p>
<p>You should already have done this, of course, if you've bought anything on Steam, which I'm going to assume is 90% of you, with the other 10% being GOG stopouts, holier-than-thou Itch lovers and stinky pirates. According to reports, debit cards are acceptable too.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The regulation follows the passing of the UK's Online Safety Act, which now requires a host of online platforms to impose age verification systems, so as to protect younger people from pornography (among other things). I will offer no further comment on the OSA at this stage - it's after 2pm on Friday, which is far too late in the week to have Opinions - but I'm relieved to discover that I can still google images of donkey willies on a work PC. Eurogamer's Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">a fuller write-up</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Valve have a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Steam blog</a> up, which explains the process for age verification and the need for a credit card in particular.</p>
<p>"In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks," it reads. "This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.
</p>
<p>"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the post continues.
</p>
<p>According to the Redditors who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1n34vzd/uk_users_must_verify_their_age_to_access_steam/">spotted all this earlier today</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), debit cards appear to be acceptable at least for the time being. Which is good, because I don't have a credit card, and I'd sure hate to be unable to buy *googles random adult games again* "Ideology In Friction"? I didn't know Althusser made a porno.</p><p>Valve have had a busy few months in terms of adult-rated controversy. As you're hopefully very well aware, given that we wouldn't shut up about it, they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">changed</a> Steam's regulations to give banks and credit card networks a say on the definition of acceptable NSFW games. A bunch of games have been delisted as a consequence. In connection to all that, Paypal recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">pulled support for Steam purchases in certain countries</a> at the behest of one of their acquiring banks.</p>
