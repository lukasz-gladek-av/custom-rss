            <p>Workers at Reflector Entertainment, the Montreal studio that recently released third-person action adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unknown-9">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, have been hit by layoffs, according to a number of employees who made the cuts public on social media. The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn't known, as Reflector haven't made a public statement about it. But among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The layoffs were spotted by Kotaku reporter Ethan Gach, who pointed it out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lbdcdushd22s">on Bluesky</a>. Sure enough, a glance at LinkedIn shows several game workers announcing they are looking for new jobs. Among those I've seen are a 3D modeller, character artist, UI programmer, community manager, lighting expert, game designer, narrative designer, and a senior environment artist. That range of roles suggests the layoffs are widespread, affecting all departments. We've asked Reflector Entertainment for more information on the job cuts. </p>
<p>Unknown 9 is set in an alternate history earth, in which you play a "Quaestor" with special abilities, travelling the globe to fight a shadowy secret society. Bandai Namco liked the look of it enough to buy the studio in 2020, and there was enough invested in the world to produce two novels, a scripted podcast, and a comic book. It's unclear from these layoffs whether the fictional world itself is also being retired or if Bandai Namco intend to keep it going.</p>
<p>For the real people affected, this looks like further brutal cost-cutting from Bandai Namco, who have recently been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bandai-namco-is-reportedly-cutting-workforce-following-cancellation-of-several-titles">axing jobs</a> in their Japanese studios (via a very unpleasant method if <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?">reports by Bloomberg</a> are accurate). Early this year they also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-publishers-bandai-namco-cancel-at-least-five-games-target-future-emphasis-on-quality">cancelled several games</a> due to "higher than expected" development costs. </p><p>As for Unknown 9 itself, the game seems to have sold quite poorly, and currently has an average "mixed" rating on Steam. It was arguably under-marketed for a game of its production values. We saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-9-awakening-is-a-brand-new-game-that-already-has-a-big-weird-expanded-universe">a 90-second teaser trailer</a> in 2020, then heard no more about the game itself until earlier this year, when it reappeared to show off a mix of Tomb Raider adventuring, Assassin's Creed conspiracy theories, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars">Star Wars</a> force powers. </p>
<p>Former RPS editor Katharine Castle continues to earn her reputation as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">a hellish prophet</a>, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-years-of-silence-unknown-9-awakening-re-emerges-as-a-supernatural-mash-up-of-assassins-creed-with-star-wars-force-powers">playing a preview</a> of the game earlier this year and speaking to the studio's head of production Jean-Francois Deschamps. During which she suspected the game's final months of creation would be a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, it's a challenge that's "really exciting" to try and meet as a studio, [Deschamps] tells us, though given everything that's happened to the industry over the last 12 months, with studios big and small having to down-size or outright shut up shop after failing to make back their development costs, I do worry how long that excitement will last when Unknown 9 launches later this summer.</blockquote>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it's probably because something similar happened recently with multiplayer shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>. After a financially disastrous launch, the studio behind the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">unceremoniously shut down</a> by parent company Sony earlier this month. Once again, it is the workers who are most impacted when big companies get over-excited.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
