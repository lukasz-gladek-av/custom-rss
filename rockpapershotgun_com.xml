            <p>A healthy pinch of my motivation for writing about waiter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> plate em' up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-way-of-the-tray">The Way Of The Tray</a> is so I can read your hospitality job horror stories in the comments, but I do love the energy here. It's a breathless, colourful (actual) plate-spinner that has you serve mythical dishes in the daily grind for tips from Yokai customers. You'll then invest those tips back into waiter skills and restaurant upgrades, or at least whatever petty cash is left over from paying rent.</p>

<p>I personally would not rely on the structural integrity of a layer of onigiri to support multiple clay bowls and glass bottles, but I am not a professional, nor do I have to please a clientele of demons, large spiders, and Kappas. I also personally wouldn't have written the phrase "immerse yourself in the mysterious atmosphere of Japan" in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/">Steam features</a>, since all you have to do there is add an '-ese folklore' to not sound like a 17th century powder-wigged buffoon trotting out his maid in Geisha makeup for tonight's dinner party entertainment. Here are some less irksomely worded features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the art of keeping your tray balanced: every mistake can cost you a tip. Learn to manage your time so you can serve all your guests on time and prevent them from leaving.</li>
<li>Serve unusual orders to yokai and learn all the secrets of local cuisine.</li>
<li>Develop your waiter skills to earn more tips and invest them in upgrades, and don’t forget to pay the rent.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own experience in food service includes frying up English breakfasts in a chippy cafe, temping for a catering company for weddings, and working in a Wetherspoons-grade pub kitchen (I believe the professional term is "microwave ape"). None of these were especially negative, mind. The chippy was in a popular holiday town, which led me to observe that some customers will treat any perceived imperfection as a direct assault on their perfect getaway, but I suppose the nature of limited leisure time makes solipsists of us all. As does paying six quid for a bacon roll. If I'd known you were going to be a Kappa I would have whacked extra cucumber in there, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-hideout">new blogvert</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' hideout customisation appeared yesterday, just when you thought it was safe to play another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> following the merciless time vacuum that was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth"> Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>'s Dondoko Island.</p>
<p>The hideout is an acre of "fully customisable" land for Naoe and Yasuke to visit for a breather.  Once there, you can pop down buildings, shrubbery, animals, and decorations. The blog also specifies the placement of "mossy rocks". No other types though. Moss or piss off.</p>

<p>Here's some grid snapping action.</p>

<p>"Each building &amp; upgrade will also have a direct impact on gameplay," the blog says. The dojo trains combat allies. The forge upgrades weapons. A tea room lets you "increase ration efficiency", and so on. I assume that's something to do with health, although I'm now picturing a radical late nineties console advert in which a spiky-haired youth shouts downstairs at his parents that he can't go to grandma's house because he's "increasing ration efficiency, Mom!". Nothing says excitement like upgrade names that evoke board room minutes.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the grid snapping action also applies to animal companions, who you can pop down and visit to pet at your leisure. "We had all these endearing critters all over the world already," writes Dany of the senior design team, "and everyone's instant reaction is to drop everything they're doing and stare at them for a minute. It made sense for us to make them available inside of the Hideout."</p>
<p>This isn't entirely accurate to my experience with Assassin's Creed, since I actually spent a good chunk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a> on a personal quest to find every bear in Greece and kick them in the face. Call me out for being an awful cynic here, but this also feels like a case of "give the player what they think they want" at the expense of those moments Dany describes. I'm not sure how often I'd stop and to stare at wildlife in the open world if I've already got a hideout carpeted in deer poo.</p>
<p>To further populate, upgrade, and decorate your hideout, the open world is scattered with resources for you to collect - or possibly pay for since it's Assassin's Creed, a pioneer in the groundbreaking "give us a tenner for this bag of wood" monetisation field.</p>
<p>This is purely speculation on my part, however. Ubisoft have already announced they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">dropping the season pass model</a>, although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Steam listing</a> does offer a pricier edition that includes some DLC, so this feels more like a token rebranding than the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">currently flailing</a>) company turning over a new mossy rock.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I'm emanating pessimism like a <a href="https://freshare.net/persimmon-seeds-predict-warm-winter-above-average-snow-fall-in-the-ozarks-freshare-net/">snow hater dissecting a spoon-shaped persimmon seed</a>, so I should say that I think this all sounds like a pleasant and serene way to spend time between the hustle and/or bustle of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sengoku">Sengoku</a> period. A few customisation tools go a long way in helping you feel ownership over a space, and I'm a sucker for anything that lets me enjoy the vibe of pruning a bonsai without the anguish of having that bonsai die approximately fourteen seconds after I bring it home. Also, I like the sound of the ally conversations at the hideout:</p>
<p>"Having our allies in one place creates opportunities for character development," the blog says. "We gathered the writers (from 4 different studios all over the world) in a meeting and had them create interactions inspired by questions like, 'What would happen if these two characters suddenly became roommates?' I really love all the cool little moments they came up with. It makes the Hideout feel like the beating heart of the league".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</a> is out tomorrow. I'll have a review up soon, but I wanted to post some quick thoughts on the new translation.</p>
<p>“For the original games, the size of the dialogue box was quite small and there wasn’t a lot that we could fit in there," producer Yasuo Daikai <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-interview-suikoden-hd-remaster">told IGN back in 2022</a>. "Japanese is a language that can say a lot in a very short amount of space, but for English and other languages, you need a lot of space to say the same thing usually. So in this game we have expanded the size of those dialogue boxes, and that has let us retool and work on the localization to get us more in tune with the Japanese script,"</p>

<p>I wasn't able to check all or even most of the dialogue, instead pausing occasionally to compare the remasters to footage of the Playstation originals. But most lines I did compare are different. It's a fine translation, but one that sometimes sacrifices idiosyncratic character for what feels like cautious legibility. Considering how difficult these games are to own legally, my ideal package would have been one that preserved the original scripts in some form.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stilted becomes the colloquial in ways that feel sensible and deft. Viktor's "Prepare yourselves for a surprise" from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 is now "you might wanna sit down for this". Sometimes, the poetic becomes more commonplace. "Not that I see our reunion in the stars," Leknaat tells the hero in the original. "Not based on an astrology reading," she says now. Odessa's "Our tiny newborn hope must be kept alive" is now "that small flame of hope must be kept alive."</p>
<p>Other changes are more subjective, depending on how much you like Suikoden's goofiness, but seem clear examples of extra space being used. Instead of the hero having the option to tell Emperor Barbarossa "I don't wanna", he can now say "not if I can help it".</p>
<p>I've only played a little of Suikoden 2 at time of writing, but every line I compared in the introduction is slightly different. Again, these strike me as a translator using the extra space that Daikai mentioned to craft more precise lines. Jowy's "Me too. I thought about going back to Kyaro and I couldn't wait to get out of that uniform" is now "Me too, actually. No way I could stay in that uniform any longer knowing we're headed home to Kyaro." Luca Blight's "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that old man. I'm getting rusty" is now "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that stupid old man. I'm falling out of practise."</p>

<p>Since review embargo is up, I can tell you I'm having a lovely time revisiting two games that are precious to me beyond words (which is awkward because I have to write about them). There are also plenty of features in support of preservation: music, cutscene, and cinematic galleries with concept art backgrounds. There's no lack of love or care here. Suikoden I character designer Junko Kawano's new portraits are a real treat, especially. But - speaking purely in terms of preservation - there's something irreplaceable about a fourteen year old answering an emperor's request with "I don't wanna", and I'd have loved to see an original translation menu toggle.</p>
<p>(Yes - the dragons still sound like elephants.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
