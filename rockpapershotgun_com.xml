            <p>Joining the rare but always brilliant category of “games that sound like someone scratched the high concept into their arm at pub closing time with the sharp corner of a Frazzles packet” is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/Assassinvisible">Assassinvisible</a> - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game about an invisible assassin that’s so invisible the player doesn’t know where they are. True, games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375750/Invisigun_Reloaded/">Invisigun</a> have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:</p>

<p>This one’s going to be very quote-y, because I’m still trying to wrap my head around it myself. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207460/Assassinvisible/">Steam page</a> describes Assassinvisible thusly: “A cute bite-sized puzzle and stealth game that takes place in the margins of a bored pupil's notebook. You're an invisible assassin, sneak your way past the guards to reach your target and erase it!”</p>
<p>The idea, as far as I can tell, is that you’ll track your own movements through the hand-drawn puzzles one square at a time, trying to reach your target and take them out. Through the framing, you’ll also learn more about the student drawing you. Here are the features, which themselves feature the word ‘complexifying’:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn levels (that the kid made, certainly not us) with ever complexifying, unique and interesting situations -absolutely no filler.</li>
<li>An original gameplay where the character is invisible for the enemies, but also for the players!</li>
<li>A touching story told through a pupil's notebook.</li>
<li>Your ultimate revenge for all those years spent being bored (and having fun) in class.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>It’s from French studio Zaatar Café, and it’s out on the 13th of December. Until then, the studio have a few smaller releases on Itch.io you can <a href="https://zaatarcafe.itch.io/">find here</a>. My favourite of these is ‘the elusive portal snake’, which Zaatar Café didn’t design, but recreated from memory after a previous mash up of Portal and Snake they played on Itch got deleted. Storied!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As per a recent update to their FAQ page, The Game Awards have confirmed that DLCs, new game seasons for live service games, and other such releases are eligible for their game of the year award.</p>
<p>The FAQ itself - which appears to have been accessible over the weekend but now links to a ‘coming soon’ page - says the following. Thanks <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-game-awards-will-now-consider-dlc-and-remasters-for-all-its-award-categories/">Neowin</a> for quoting it in its entirety:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><strong>Are DLCs, expansion packs and remakes/ remasters eligible?</strong></p>
<p>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>For this year, this means that releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">The Silent Hill 2</a> remake or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> would be eligible for the GOTY category. A win for either would mean the first time The Game Awards’ GOTY went to anything other than a full release. Previously, things like well loved expansions have factored into, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> winning ‘Best Ongoing Game’ last year, no doubt in part to its excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> DLC.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake"> Resident Evil 4</a>’s remake was also nominated in the GOTY category last year.</p>

<p>Whether you feel this is an understandable decision given the quality of some expansions, or change that only further benefits a few obvious favourites at the expense of more interesting titles, I’ll leave that up to you. Whoever wins, I lose anyway: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> will doubtless get no love. Plus, Alice Bell (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">already summed up the Games Awards better than anybody</a>, imo. Hey ho! Reveals are nice at least! The nominees themselves are being announced later today at 9am PT/12pm ET/5pm GMT.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
