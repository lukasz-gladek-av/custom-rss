            <p>Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824720/Pure_Rock_Crawling/">Steam page</a> boasts of the features you'd want: it's got soft body physics on the tires, suspension that you can tweak as if you know what you're doing, and a range of different kinds of terrain to free roam around. The latest hunk of terrain is a map called Ghost Mine, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/824720/view/518576368664969762">based on photogrammetry assets created by the game's maker after a trip to Death Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>It seems like Pure Rock Crawling was released in Early Access in April 2018 and hit 1.0 in October 2024. I really don't know how I've never heard of it before, but it looks like its 1.0 release hasn't stopped there being a trickle of new updates in the months since. 
</p>
<p>I liked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spintires">Spintires</a> back when it came out some ten years ago, then lost track of it when it became mired in the mud of controversy and was succeeded by MudRunners. There's something supremely satisfying about getting up and over an obstacle, whether you're driving a big rig or even a dirt bike in a game like Trials. I have no interest in high scores or improving my times, but I will absolutely have a go at hauling myself up a mountain.
</p>
<p>Pure Rock Crawling is 50% off to coincide with the release of the new map, making it £6.39/$7.49/€7.39 at the time of writing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game</a>, according to me and the RPS staff who dare not cross me. I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.
</p>
<p>How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, it's getting two new pig variants. The cold pig is coated with fur and will be found in cold and frozen biomes; the warm pig will found in the sandy biomes and is rust-brown. Mojang are calling it the "warm pig" because they know that, fundamentally, all pigs are hot.
</p>
<p>These cute porkchops are part of a handful of minor updates coming to Minecraft, which are all currently available to test in the Java Edition (and only some available to test in Bedrock).
</p>
<p>Forest biomes are also now getting falling leaves, which will flitter from the tree canopy and leave leaf litter on the ground. Leaf litter can be used to decorate blocks and rustles when you walk through it. In meadows and birch forests, you'll also find wildflowers, which have multiple stages of growth and can be gathered to craft into dye. Only the falling leaves are present in Bedrock preview and beta currently.
</p><p>Lastly, the Lodestone crafting recipe is being amended. This block, which compasses point towards to help players find their way home, previously required eight chiseled stone bricks and a netherite ingot to make. Netherite isn't easy to come by in Minecraft, requiring a long and lucky visit to the Nether to obtain Ancient Debris. Given that the Lodestone is meant to help players with the simple task of not getting lost near their home, that seems a bit daft, so a Lodestone can now be crafted with a simple iron ingot in place of the netherite instead. This turns a late-game item into something early or mid, which makes more sense.
</p>
<p>All of these changes are small, but god, I play so much of this game now. I am pumped for there to be leaves on the ground. My hobbit homes are going to look so quaint with leaves on the ground outside.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> received a patch earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-patch-makes-hulk-less-hulky-hawkeye-less-shooty-and-the-goddess-of-death-deader-just-in-time-for-season-1">which made Hulk less hulky</a> and paved the way for the launch of its first season. It also did something else: disabled the mods players had been using to add custom skins to the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins">IGN</a>, players are reporting that the latest update adds asset hash checking, effectively blocking the use of edited files inside the game.
</p>
<p>The move maybe comes as no surprise. Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play hero shooter that makes money by selling premium skins to players. Allowing mods enables players to make versions of those skins themselves for free. A number of such skins have proven <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/">popular on Nexus Mods</a> since Rivals' launch last year, including replacing Iron Man with Vegeta and the Winter Soldier with CJ from GTA: San Andreas.
</p>
<p>I can think of no live service game (of this type) that allows this kind of modding, and the game's terms of use have forbidden mods since the off. Publishers NetEase have also stated publicly that players risk being banned for modifying any game files.
</p><p>Inevitable or not, I am forced to write my little spiel once more: that games are better with mod support, and first-person games thrived once upon a time in part due to mods, and all of this used to be fields. I honestly doubt the existence of some daft, free, user-made skins is going to eat into Marvel Rivals' bottomline, and I'm sure there are technical workarounds that would allow the practice without threatening the integrity of online matches. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> has thousands of mods, for example.
</p>
<p>One supposes that there's another issue here: that license holder Disney wouldn't be too pleased if the Marvel characters they've leant NetEase end up covered in visible nipples. Cowards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
