        <p>Ah, yes. The rare 'good videogame'.</p>

            <p>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/showa-american-story">Showa American Story</a> is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:</p>

<p>It’s so wonderful, somewhere between RGG and Grasshopper Manufacture, with a little bit of one of my all time favourite films, Tokyo Gore Police, thrown in for good measure. It’s “a brand new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> and an enthusiastic love letter to the 80s' pop culture that features a strong taste of B-Movies,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687540/Showa_American_Story/">Steam</a>. “Follow Choko's journey of truth and revenge across North America as she grows stronger.” It’s from Nekcom, who previously put out the confoundingly named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699700/DYING_Reborn/">DYING: Reborn</a> - a gory escape room. Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Showa 66, Japan has bought out most of the United States with its strong economic power. A surge of immigration has firmly planted Japanese culture within the American continent. Two cultures are rapidly amalgamated, although conflicts are inevitable, citizens gradually adapt to a life never imagined as time goes by.</p>
<p>However, a mysterious catastrophic incident changes the world drastically. The social order is long gone. An unknown amount of time passes, a teenage girl mysteriously revives from the dead, only to find a brand new wild post-apocalyptic world with zombies, monsters, and human survivors of different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as combat, you’ll be travelling around the US in a “big” RV. It’s big! You’ll be able to customise it, as well as “enhance Choko's status and unlock abilities through various enjoyable "Living Activities". Finally, the enjoyable living activities I crave. No release date on this one yet, but you can bet I’ll be shouting loudly about it as soon as we get one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Real gamblers play russian roulette with shotguns. That is the core concept of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-looking game of blinksweat and bulletworry. It's been out for a while now but the developers have just added a fun extra - a 4-person multiplayer mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>They teased this multiplayer mode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unnerving-2-gem-buckshot-roulette-is-working-on-a-multiplayer-mode-so-you-can-play-shotgun-roulette-with-pals">earlier in the year</a> but just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/4477234095318892693">posted the update on Steam</a> yesterday. The game remains one of uncertain trigger pulling. A handful of shells - some duds, some live - are loaded into a shotgun in a random and unseen order. Players then take turns pointing the gun at one another (or themselves) and committing their lives to lady luck. Click! Phew, this one was a dud. </p>
<p>But look, what's Nipplemancer69 doing? He's slugging a beer, ejecting a shell, clicking on a mysterious gadget, and smoking a cigarette... Wait, wait, don't point that at me, Nipplemancer69! Have you even kept count of the shells correctly!? Stop. STOP.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Oh thank heavens. Between each reloading of the shotgun you get a bunch of items to make use of against your friends, you see. A cell phone with a mysterious voice on the other end, for example, who tells you what the fifth or sixth shell will be. Or a gizmo that lets you steal a device straight out of your opponent's pile. All this on top of the main game's health-regenerating cigarettes and beer cans that let you eject a shell. </p><p>There are other devices I'm far less keen on. These cause players to miss a turn, for instance, or reverse the turn order of the entire table. It's possible as a result to play a whole round without ever even laying hands on the gun. Turn-skipping mechanics in board games annoy me for the same reason. It's frustrating to sit there and helplessly watch an entire game happen around you. And in a chatless internet game setting, it really invites people to quit. I much prefer the more interesting gadgets, like the do-hicky that reverse the "polarity" of the shell in the chamber. </p>
<p>It's best done with pre-existing pals - there's no servers. If you do want to shoot strangers though, you can join the Discord of the game's publisher, Critical Reflex, where lots of people are dumping lobby codes into a "looking for game" channel. It's not perfect as multiplayer goes, but on the plus side it's a supremely cheap game at around £2. So the buy-in is not particularly high. And the core concept - trying to keep track of live rounds and dud rounds while people muddy the waters with gadgetry - remains compelling enough to get a few tense and funny moments, as players miscount and accidentally blow their own heads off. (Yes, I did do this. Leave me alone.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users. Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">post</a> on EA’s tech support hub, Respawn’s immediate culling of ApeLeg’s Linux support – which, to be clear, effectively renders it unplayable on SteamOS – is a well-meaning sacrifice to the anti-cheat pantheon. The post explains that Linux is particularly vulnerable to exploitation by hacker types, due to it not allowing anti-cheat measures access to the deep, dark levels of OS kernel space that they typically need to block non-kosher modifications.</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex," it reads. "While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today."</p>
<p>Yeah. I dunno. While it is technically true that Linux is more protective of its kernel space than Windows (ironically, this is in part to ensure all its drivers remain open source), I’ve been playing Apex Legends since it released nearly six years ago, and I’ve been rolled over by a passing aimbotter... twice? Maybe thrice? I’ve never felt the impression that its legit playerbase is being held at the mercy of a horde of rampaging Linux abusers. As such, it’s hard to agree that effectively banning an entire operating system, taking out the world’s most widely played handheld PC in the process, is a proportionate response.</p><p>For bonus bafflement, Respawn have previously been unusually supportive of the Deck, working with Valve back in 2021 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">improve SteamOS compatibility with Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and earn Apex a coveted Steam Deck Verified badge. Today, that cheerful green tick is replaced by the grumpy grey of Unsupported status. And that’s saying nothing of the small (but, if they’re still playing a shooter from 2019, loyal) contingent of desktop Linux/SteamOS players who’ve now been locked out as well.</p>
<p>Windows-based handhelds, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/asus-rog-ally">Asus ROG Ally</a> series and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a>, are unaffected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
