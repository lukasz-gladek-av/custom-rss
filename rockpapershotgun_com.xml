Deep beneath the smog of a plausibly denied planetoid, there lurks a space hulk full of dessicated hand monsters, shorn dreadlocks and long-emptied Pulse Rifles. The vessel mostly lies silent, but every so often, an ancient server deep within the core crackles awake, beaming an ominous signal far out into the void, and the chitinous corridors come alive with flamethrowers and squelchy stabbing noises and oh, so much screaming. Also, the coveted chirping of Steam achievements.

<p>
The vessel in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-vs-predator">Alien Vs Predator</a>. Not Rebellion's original three-way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 1999, mind, but the 2010 threequel which people derided at the time, but which is clearly some gradation of Good Video Game in that a few of those people are still playing it, 15 years later. 
</p>

This weekend, the supposedly dead game enjoyed a sudden Steam playercount bounce to around five thousand concurrent players, care of a community-run server. Many were motivated by the desire to earn one of the game's rarest Steam achievements, The Six Pack, which requires you to play a ranked match with six Steam friends. That a whopping 2.2% of players have earned this to date suggests (out of context) that the original AVP multiplayer scene died on its arse rather quickly. So it's nice that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/10680">somebody's coordinating efforts to boost the numbers</a>. We'll make it to 3.0 someday. Perhaps in another 15 years.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing this up partly because it's evidence of the good that can happen when publishers take steps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">to ensure that their online games can be played after the cessation of official support</a>. And partly, I'm writing it up because it's nice to revisit Rebellion's Alien games. The 1999 game was a frantic pressure-cooker shooter with excellent lighting, in that you generally couldn't see the Aliens until you flash-bulbed them with muzzle fire. It also featured many lovely adaptations of the film sets, which you could clamber all over as a sticky-fingered xenomorph. It didn't do nearly as good a job with the Predators, but then again, there has never been a good Predator game. You know I speak truth, Yautja lovers. Fight me.
</p>
<p>
The 2010 game has been much shat-upon. In our review, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-aliens-vs-predator">witheringly summed it up</a> as "not a terrible singleplayer shooter", "just a very ordinary one", adding that the multiplayer almost saves it: "when a couple of adept players are stalking random panickers like myself, this really threatens to be the game we hoped it would be." I was similarly unenamored when I reviewed the game for some magazine or other, but the community drive for Six Pack achievements has me yearning for the dropship.
</p>
<p>
The Six Pack initiative seems to have prompted a wave of Overwhelmingly Positive Steam reviews. I was tickled by the one that objects that the game should more properly be called "Marines vs Aliens vs Predator". I like the implication that human players of Aliens vs Predator - which I estimate covers about about 70% of you, based on the wording and tenor of the average RPS comment - are in danger of feeling left out. Also, Marines aren't a species, but don't let that stop you launching a Change.org petition. While you're at it, see if you can get Godzilla vs Kong retitled Godzilla vs Kong vs Commuters.
