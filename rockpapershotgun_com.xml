            <p>The USA's Immigration Customs Enforcement service, aka ICE, have started using imagery of Microsoft's sci-fi shooter Halo for recruitment posts on social media, even as Gamestop and the US administration indulge in some bantz characterising Donald Trump as Master Chief, and even as Microsoft attempt to flog a new Halo game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">reported</a> by journalist Alyssa Mercante, the US Homeland Security account put out <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">a Xeet on October 27th</a> with the message "Finishing this fight", a reference to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a>'s tagline, alongside a picture of Mr Chief driving the legendary Warthog humvee across the original Halo ringworld from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, with the label "Destroy the Flood". 
</p>
<p>For context, the Flood are an enveloping, parasitic lifeform who want to overrun and consume all other species. You can see how that framing of an overwhelming invasion might appeal to the top brass at ICE, who have carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">a brutal mass deportation campaign</a> that has placed tens of thousands in detention, including thousands who have no criminal record.
</p>
<p>Separately, US retailer GameStop have declared "the console wars over" in <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">a Xeet from October 25th</a>. The impetus for this is Microsoft's announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">a Halo: Combat Evolved campaign remake</a>, which will be the first Halo project to appear on PlayStation consoles - much to the public outrage and secret voyeuristic delight of Xbox fanboys - and introduces a few prequel missions featuring Chief's buddy Sergeant Johnson.
</p><p>"Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," goes the GameStop post, in jocular legalese. "GameStop will continue to operate as a demilitarized zone, offering hardware, accessories, and trade-ins to combatants on all sides". 
</p>
<p>A couple of days later, the official White House twitter <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">shared GameStop's post</a> with the message "power to the players", adding a dinky little image of Donald Trump dressed in Spartan armour with a plasma sword, saluting on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Stars and Stripes.
</p>
<p>GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">replied with an image of their own</a>, featuring Master Trump and a remarkably unpleasant version of Chief's AI mission handler/love interest/mother figure Cortana, who has been doctored to resemble US vice-president JD Vance. The speed at which the images were shared implies that they were AI-generated, though I can't confirm this.
</p>
<p>It's often and not unreasonably claimed that reactionary gamers played a major part in Trump's rise to power, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamergate-chat-logs/">Gamergate hate movement</a> of 2014 onwards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/08/gamergate-trolls-woke-game-consultants">introducing various "alt-right" demagogues and Trumpist politicians to an embittered segment of players</a> who think feminism and progressive politics are a blight on society. The Trump administration's tweets above certainly reinforce that chain of connection. 
</p><p>In general, the banter between GameStop and Trump together with ICE's latest recruitment drive is an absolute triple-concentrated circus of contemporary demons. Fascism, chan humour, and the military entertainment complex spinning around in a toilet bowl, exchanging possibly Grok-derived high fives. The trade-in shelf as DMZ. The marketing fiction of a war between rival consumers re-deployed as a MAGA meme. 
</p>
<p>Neither GameStop nor Microsoft have responded to Mercante's requests for comment. The White House press office has replied to her with some snippy (and in Mercante's view, likely illegal) emails referencing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7d9j7p5qo">the current US government shutdown</a>, which they blame on their Democrat opponents in Congress.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the USA's Homeland Security organisation has invoked a videogame for recruitment purposes. Back in September, they put out <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">a jokey Pokémon video on Xitter</a> with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", which shows immigration enforcement agents rounding people up, with bleak gags about Pokémon being vulnerable to ice-based attacks. It seems obvious that the aim is as much to wind up progressives as to draw recruits.</p>
<p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo">pushed back</a> against ICE, albeit gingerly, stating that "our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property." We'll see if Microsoft do likewise. I'll send them a request for comment now.</p>

            <p>Twice now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> devs Team Cherry have put out a Simplified Chinese translation of the Metroidvania, only for Chinese players to point out some stuff it does weirdly. Well, in their third crack at providing said translation, Team Cherry look to have gone the tried and trusted route, introducing a fan-made one people already like with the latest update to patch 4's ongoing Steam beta.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, the Simplified Chinese translation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> offered at launch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit Shakespearey</a>, leading to mixed reviews of the game in the region. Team Cherry were quick to introduce a second translation in an attempt to rectify the issue, but that one ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-4-live-in-steam-beta-problems-persist-with-its-new-simplified-chinese-translation">earning thumbs downs from players</a> due to how it translated some place and character names.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to attempt number three, the delivery of a Simplified Chinese fan translation by Team Cart Fix. "Team Cart Fix's translation has been well received by the community," Team Cherry wrote in the patch 4 beta update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/603045243319975841/">Steam post</a>. "Their approach builds from elements of the original translation, retaining existing names for characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>."</p>
<p>Scrolling down to read some early feedback on the translation, which the devs stress will have "some small issues" due to the fact its implementation hasn't been finalised, I can see one Chinese player claiming that "some errors that were previously corrected by new translators have been retained again". They've highlighted 'Last Judge' and 'Fay Mountains' as perhaps having been translated a bit too literally, but we'll have to wait for more verdicts to roll in to see for sure whether those are wider issues or more personal nitpicks.</p><p>As for the rest of patch 4, Team Cherry say it's still in line for more fixes ahead of release. With this update, they've added fixes for the likes of issues with Rune Rage and Thread Storm damage, when using the harpoon to stun or kill certain bosses, and "instances of Hornet being able to push some enemy types through the floor". Couriers should also no longer offer you exactly the same delivery immediately after you've completed it. Phew.</p>
<p>Hopefully this fan translation does the trick, or I fear patch 4 might be in the beta realm forever.</p>

            <p>Bully, Rockstar's classic boarding school Bart Simpson simulator, is about to have another massive multiplayer mod fired at it from a slingshot. The mod's dubbed Bully Online, stands atop the battered blazer of a previous attempt to let a bunch of folks play Bully together, and is set to arrive in paid early access this December.</p>

<p>Bully Online's being worked on by a group of modders which includes Rockstar-focused YouTuber Swegta, who's announced the mod via the video above. It includes a trailer and some gameplay snippets showing off different aspects of the mod, including roleplaying-focused free roam, trolley racing, and minigames. The whole thing understandably seems very GTA Online-inspired, just with schoolkids mucking around instead of uber-rich criminals with dodgy tattoos and flying death bikes.</p>
<p>"Bully Online runs on the DSL script loader, which is a plugin for Bully that essentially allows for a way more versatile approach to modding," Swegta explains. "A lot of the things that we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time."</p><p>Prior to that, the team plan to release the mod in paid early access this December, with those who pay $8 to support it on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline">Ko-fi</a> being let in ahead of the general public, as well as being granted perks like server queue priority and an in-game camera they can use to save pictures. "Supporting us on Ko-Fi means that we can spend more time working on this and us spending more time working on this means that it's going to be available to the general public sooner," Swegta says of the decision to go this potentially eyebrow-raising route.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first massive multiplayer mode modders have attempted to add to Bully. A <a href="https://bully-mp.com/#preview_release">Bully multiplayer mod</a> was released back in 2018, with Swegta involved as a community manager, but since looks to have <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/bully-multiplayer">ended up dormant</a>. The YouTuber offered his perspective as to why that project ran aground in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2_pa_cPic">a video six months ago</a>, and says in the Bully Online announcement that "some of the ideas that did not make it into BullyMP have been repurposed for this project".</p>
<p>"It's been in the making for a very long time," he added. "The cool thing about doing Bully Online is that we can add any kind of miniame or game mode that we feel is fitting for it. This is our project and we're able to do anything we want with it."</p>
<p>Given how that previous Bully multiplayer mod turned out, I think I'd take a wait and see approach with this latest one. Especially given there are the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bullyscholarshipedition/mods/242?tab=description">Bully co-op mods</a> already out there if you're desperate to prank some nerds with a mate.</p>

            <p>
After much wrangling with players over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>’s Age system, which sees you taking charge of different civilizations as you progress from Antiquity into the Modern era, Firaxis are bringing back the option to play as one culture all the way to the endgame. They’re now playtesting the feature internally, and want players to help by way of a new community testing initiative, the Firaxis Feature Workshop. 
</p>
<p>
Firaxis have also shared a few snippets from Civilization 7’s update 1.3.0, due in the week of November 3rd alongside the Tides of Power DLC, which will be free to existing owners of the troubled 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> over the Xmas holidays. Update 1.3.0 is all about nautical doings and conspirings, with new naval units and buildings, the addition of ranged combat to ocean warfare, and some delightfully soggy terrain features. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Writing on the Civblog, creative director Ed Beach dropped some hot goss about “two of the biggest things in motion” at CivHQ. “First, we're testing some dramatic changes to the Legacy Paths and Victories in Civ VII,” he wrote. “We want to open up the game and provide many new paths your empire can follow while achieving greatness and competing for victory.
</p>
<p>
“Second - and this one’s been one of the most requested features from players - we're internally playtesting ways to play as one civ continuously through the ages, allowing you to choose a civilization from any Age and guide them throughout your journey through history.”
</p><p>
Firaxis would like a “small number of community members” to go hands-on with these and other WIP features via the aforesaid Workshop. They’ll share details of how to apply in the next few months – for more, join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/civilizationofficial">Discord</a>. Beach also notes that you can expect “smaller, less frequent updates” over the Xmas holidays “while the team shifts into testing and iteration on these larger changes, and preparing for the Workshop”.
</p>
<p>
Thus the gauzy hypotheticals of Civilizations to come. Now, let’s dig into the sweaty specifics of that imminent Civ 7 update. It introduces a new warehouse building, the Harbor, for all Civs, which serves as a spawn for naval units and boosts your fishing production. The Harbor accompanies a new naval unit, the Privateer, unlocked in the Exploration Age on the Heraldry Civic. It’s a speedy raiding vessel with license to cross borders and attack the military units and trade routes of non-allied civs, regardless of your war status.
</p>
<p>
The ocean itself will expand with three new water resources – crabs, turtles and cowrie – plus the new pitch resource on land. Deep oceans may now generate atolls, which act “as movement-stopping terrain to create strategic choke points”, while lakes may spawn lotus terrain that provides food and gold bonuses. Base ocean tiles will become workable in the modern age and one civ, Hawaii, will also be able to work them in the exploration age.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the revamp for naval combat. Existing naval units will be split into light and heavy varieties. Light units are melee combatants with better movement and vision, plus the ability to perform flanking attacks. Heavies are ranged strikers who move slower and don’t see as far. It sounds like the optimal Civ 7 admiral will use lights and heavies in tandem.
</p><p>
These are just the highlights from the forthcoming patch. There are a few other bits <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">on the Civblog</a>, and Firaxis will share the full changelog notes down the line. As for that Tides Of Power DLC, the first part will add a new leader, Edward Teach (aka Blackbeard) plus two new civilisations - Tonga and the Republic of Pirates. The second part, coming in December, introduces Moroccan pirate leader Sayyida al Hurra, together with the Ottomans and Iceland.
</p>
<p>It's been interesting - and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> - to follow Civilization 7's attempts to right the ship after a heavily mixed launch reception, with much player ire directed at the Age system. I particularly appreciated the recent post about how they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">overhauling the map generator</a>.</p>
