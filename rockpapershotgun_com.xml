            <p>
Sony and Housemarque's sci-fantasy shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a> got its first proper gameplay trailer at PlayStation's latest State of Play this evening. If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, then pour yourself a huge brimming flagon of victory mead, for this is basically Returnal plus a gruff male lead, a sunnier shape-shifting wasteland, and a force shield that converts attacks into juice for your biggest guns.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Do people drink victory mead in the world of Saros? This is not a question answered by the trailer. Instead, we're treated to a series of agile bangfights with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Some are robotic. Some are skull-themed. Some have more arms than seems strictly necessary. Some are large enough to give Kratos the cold sweats. See that Sony? Did you a cheeky bit of license cross-pollination there.

<p>
As in Returnal - a game that took Housemarque's shmup pedigree and applied it to a third-person roguelike shooter - most of these creatures are partial to spewing the most fantastically patterned fusillades of energy projectiles. It's as though somebody had sneezed while downing their victory mead, and skilfully angled their lips and nostrils to produce a crowd-pleasing firework effect, rather than an excruciating faux pas. If you dislike being sneezed on by cosmic goblins, the game's horizontal dash looks very effective providing you manage its cooldown. 
</p><p>
The trailer blurb recaps the story premise. In Saros you play Arjun Devraj, voiced by Rajul Kohli. He's a Soltari enforcer exploring the lost colony of Carcosa in the face of an eclipse that causes the landscape to shapeshift. I don't find Devraj that compelling as a character so far, but he's got a cool coat so we'll call it even Stevens. There are also some sad holographic people you can query about Carcosa's plight.
</p>
<p>
The key differences I can see over Returnal are 1) that energy shield, which also comes in handy up against laser beam traps and the like, and 2) a Second Chance revive mechanic, which sees Devraj slamming his fist into the ground and resurrecting in sheer petulance at having accidentally taken 400 bullets to the jaw. Housemarque have been keen to emphasise that this is a gentler roguelike than Returnal, with "permanent resources and progression making every death valuable". See also the tagline, "Come back stronger". 
</p>
<p>
All we need now is a PC release date. The thing I'd most like to hear about next is the bestiary. I adored Returnal's lore writing. I thought the 3D bullet hell stuff was bonkers, too, but mostly I'm here for knotty descriptions of exceedingly odd fauna.
</p>

After four whole years of silence, PlayStation and Insomniac have very graciously offered up a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>. With gameplay no less! Horrifically gruesome, violent, and bloody gameplay that is so intense you should probably give it 15 minutes or so if you've just had your supper.
</p>
<p>
Right, here's what's important. Combat looks like it'll be borrowing from Spider-Man, which itself borrows from the Arkham series, as in that sort of rhythmic punching kind of thing, albeit with a lot more slicing and dicing. I'm talking claws up the skull, claws cutting off limbs, claws ripping bodies apart. A lot of claw action! Edwin also wanted me to make sure I mention how "sad and tender his eyes look while he's slicing peoples' elbows off," because there was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBib2xkYfE4">behind the scenes featurette</a> shown after the trailer that more or less pointed out just that.
</p>

<a aria-label="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
This featurette also confirmed who'll be playing Insomniac's Wolverine: Liam McIntyre, an Australian actor who is no stranger to superhero stuff (he was in the TV version of The Flash) or video games (he played JD Fenix in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-4">Gears of War 4</a>). I'm sure someone will have some kind of complaint about this portrayal of the character, but he does have the iconic yellow suit at least.
</p><p>
You'll also learn about how there's some dedicated blood tech made for this game, which makes sense considering just how much of the stuff they packed into just two minutes of gameplay. Mr. Wolverine will also be a bit of a jet setter, as the game will take him to both the Canadian wilderness and Japan.
</p>
<p>
There'll be some familiar comic book faces too, as Mystique made an appearance (arguably a more interesting protagonist for a game mechanically, but I digress), as well as Omega Red. Apparently there's some hints for other characters too, you'll have to wait for the "Top 10 Things You Missed In The Wolverine Gameplay Trailer" video that some YouTuber will push out by tomorrow to get a headstart on that SEO.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's a release window too! It'll be coming in the northern hemisphere's fall, 2026, but it is worth noting that's just on PS5. A PC release is all but guaranteed given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> 1 and 2 have both received one, just a good while after their initial releases. There's another look at the game coming in spring too, so for now, just enjoy Wolverine's grunting and screaming and all the mess he makes. Again, seriously, don't eat anything while watching this.
