It’s never too late to get mad about the untimely fate of Human Head Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. It helps that people keep leaking videos of the thing. The latest batch includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">an opening sequence</a>, a full mission playthrough from an open world, a flythrough of an undercity area, a prototype chase sequence, and scenes of combat. Watch the bulk of them below, and grieve. Alas for Killian Samuels, the beanie-wearing US marshal turned alien bounty-hunter. He looked so humdrum back in 2012, especially when compared to the original 2006 game’s Cherokee protagonist Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi. Still, he has a certain tragic charisma, in hindsight.

<p>
If you missed the original Prey ‘twas an uneven, UFO-ransacking first-person shooter with fancy level-splicing portal technology that has now been almost totally eclipsed by comparable features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Narbacular Drop 2</a>. A lot of people liked it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prey-2006-review">not including John Walker</a> (RPS in peace). Human Head started making a sequel shortly after the original’s release, but according to a few former studio members, they only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-prey-2-confirmed">began developing Prey 2 in earnest</a> after the rights had passed to ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda. 
</p>
<p>
Where the first game had been relatively linear, the second was to be an open world affair with a bounty-hunting theme. Bethesda announced it in 2011. But then something went wrong. Human Head quietly called time on the project near end of 2011, despite being “very close to an alpha state, with all major content pieces represented”, in the words of former project lead Chris Rhinehart. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ugh-prey-2-seems-to-have-been-cancelled">Rumours of Prey 2’s cancellation</a> swirled around over 2012, with Bethesda removing the game from their website.

<p>
Then, in 2013, it was reported that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/human-dead-dishonored-dev-rumored-to-be-on-prey-2">the project had been reassigned to Dishonored developers Arkane</a>, scrapping all previous work by Human Head in the process. Bethesda officially cancelled Prey 2 in 2014. In 2016, they announced that Arkane would develop a series reboot.
</p><p>
Released in 2017, Arkane’s Prey is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">a dashedly fine game</a>, one of the swooniest and spaciest of immersive sims, but it's hard not to mourn for Human Head. The full story of Prey 2's cancellation has yet to be told, but according to reports at the time, Bethesda pushed tough deadlines and feature requests on an increasingly cash-strapped Human Head while simultaneously looking to acquire them. Human Head eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumor-prey-2-development-stricken-by-dev-strike">downed tools in protest</a>, and the two companies were unable to haggle it out before Human Head’s contract with Bethesda ran out in 2012. 
</p>
<p>
Accounts of events differ between the companies, as you’d expect. Bethesda have resisted the idea that they were conniving to acquire Human Head, arguing that the project simply didn’t meet their standards. Having watched these videos, I'm inclined to say that Human Head should have been allowed to go the distance.

<p>
The leaked videos show off a little of the game’s planned open world bounty action. The game would have let you travel around a teeming alien city that reminds me of Coruscant and G-Police. You’d have been able to boost-glide and ledge-grab to surprise opponents. 
</p><p>
The video reveals a bustling population of aliens, all of whom sound like they have acute laryngitis, and some nightclubs featuring holographic erotic dancers, because no self-respecting blade runner’s local can do without a holodancer or two. You’d have been able to profile NPCs with a scanner, take them down with electric boladeros, and enlist the odd Klatoonian as a meatshield.

<p>
I’m more sold on the setting than the mechanics – there are passing hovercars, cargo trains, and distant flying billboards with a whole other FPS playing on them – but it looks, out of context, like a project that had legs. We will never know whether the studio could have seen it through: Human Head eventually closed doors in 2019. Beanieman RIP.

            <p>A company backed by the Saudi Arabian government's Public Investment Fund have become the co-owner of the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) fighting game tournament.</p>
<p>Following Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-sells-ownership-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming">sale of their stake in Evo</a>, with India-based esports company Nodwin gaming buying it up, the event's co-owners have been Nodwin and talent management company RTS. Well, RTS have now been bought by Qiddiya Investment Company, a PIF-backed firm that's also overseeing the building of Qiddiya City as part of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/muhannadaldawood_excited-to-share-that-qiddiya-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-has-activity-7368405316906016770-cYJX/">LinkedIn</a>, Qiddiya's chief strategy officer Muhannad Aldawood called the move "a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem". He added: "Most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world’s largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited potentials."</p>
<p>As with the array of other games industry-related <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-electronic-arts">investments</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way">acquisitions</a> Saudi PIF and Saudi government-backed firms like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-is-savvy-games-group-and-how-is-it-trying-to-change-saudi-arabias-image">Savvy Games Group</a> have made in recent years, the word of the day is sportswashing. The country's been accused of using videogame investments like these and the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Esports World Cup</a> - as well as paying to host the likes of the 2034 World Cup, WWE events, and the LIV Golf series - as part of efforts to turn around its terrible international reputation.</p><p>A bad reputation Saudi Arabia and bin Salman's regime have earned through an abysmal <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">human rights record</a> including <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/05/17/lgbtq-death-penalty-idahobit/">state-sanctioned homophobia</a>, the murder of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Kashoggi</a>, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/08/21/they-fired-us-rain/saudi-arabian-mass-killings-ethiopian-migrants-yemen-saudi">mass killings of migrants</a> at the country's border with Yemen. Invest in things people in other countries already like or follow, and maybe all of that gets buried a bit in the collective consciousness - or so appears to be the goal.</p>
<p>It's not surprising then, that when you visit <a href="https://qiddiya.com/">Qiddiya's website</a>, the first thing you see is big splash about the freshly-built Qiddiya City golf course. "This is the stage on which the Kingdom showcases its rich culture and traditions to the world and the bridge that connects us to the wonderful things the rest of the world has to offer," reads the self-described "PIF company and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/04/die-first-and-ill-pay-you-later/saudi-arabias-giga-projects-built-widespread">giga project</a>"'s blurb on culture.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what immediate effects, if any, this ownership change has on Evo. However, as my former VG247 news running mate Connor Makar notes at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Eurogamer</a>, several prominent members of the Evo/fighting game community have already shared their disapproval or begun looking towards alternative events.</p>
<p>"Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news," <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote</a> professional Street Fighter player ChrisCCH. "Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p>
