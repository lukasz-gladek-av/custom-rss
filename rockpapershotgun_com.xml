            <p>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These prices tell us that Battlemage will, as Alchemist did, attempt to bite into the sub-$250 slice of gaming GPU market share pie that Nvidia and AMD seem content to leave uneaten. This time, however, Intel say they’re aiming for speedy 1440p play, which would suggest a huge performance upgrade over 1080p-focused Alchemist models like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-a750-review">Arc A750</a>. "Best-in-class performance-per-dollar", no less, according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-launches-arc-b-series-graphics-cards.html">marketing bumf</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the Arc B580 and Arc B570 will come packing more VRAM – 12GB and 10GB respectively – and support for XeSS 2. This is new version of Intel’s upscaler that includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>-style frame generation feature, generating inserting interpolated frames "using optical flow and motion vector reprojection". Nice? I think? With all the bells and whistles running, XeSS 2 can supposedly multiply framerate output by by 3.9x, though I’d wait to see this in action before slapping down money for a pre-order. Democratising the advantages of frame generation is a noble goal in the face of Nvidia keeping DLSS 3 support for only its latest RTX 40 series GPUs, but FSR 3 has never quite matched it on visual quality or input lag management. Thus, grudgingly, we must accept some truth in the idea that frame gen needs very specific, cutting-edge hardware to work comfortably.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m more interested in straight-up, traditionally rendered framerates, and specifically whether Intel really can pull off a proper 60fps@1440p card – or two – at such a low price. Or, as we would have said in 2016 or so, a price. The last few years have seen GPU costs rise, yet the GPU themselves sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-pc-performance-best-settings">struggling to keep up</a> with the ever-increasing demands of high fidelity games, to the extent that you can easily end up dropping £500/$500 or more to get a truly capable Quad HD engine. We probably can’t expect the Arc B580 to knock the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">RTX 4070 Super</a> off its premium perch, but given the dearth of compelling options in the lower budget ranges, I’m certainly willing to watch it take a shot.</p>
<p>In other graphics card news, Nvidia are widely expected to reveal the GeForce RTX 5090 at Las Vegas’ CES show in early January. It will probably cost more than $219. Just a bit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">"solved game"</a> whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. </p>
<p>How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>In this roguelike deckbuilder, each round of noughts and crosses is an individual skirmish in a vengeful duck's quest against some murderous chickens. I don't have time to explain that premise, because my opponent has just played a specialised kind of cross that sets neighbouring noughts on fire.</p>
<p>I will retaliate with a nought that causes earthquakes, reshuffling the pieces, then play a nought that restore my health. Yep, Tic Tactic is one of those games that takes a centuries-old proven concept and asks "but what if it was an RPG". So far, it's getting away with it. I've just been playing <a href="https://unbreaded.itch.io/tictactic">the Itch.io browser demo</a>, and I'm enjoying the transformation of a game I loathe into one I can imagine playing on the tube.</p><p>It feels like the trick isn't that the noughts and crosses have a bunch of wacky D&amp;D modifiers. The secret sauce is that when you score a line of three, dealing damage to the other player, it doesn't reset the board. The scoring tiles vanish, leaving spare or opposing tiles in place. So in addition to setting up those trios, you've got to worry about follow-through, plus the usual roguelike business of saving your most powerful pieces for the opportune moment. Just some very cursory impressions, anyway. </p>
<p>Tic Tactic is on Itch.io right now, with a Steam page to follow in the next week or so. I'm writing it up in advance of the Steam page's launch because I'm going to have my hands full next week, but I'll sling the link into the Maw when it arrives. There's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
