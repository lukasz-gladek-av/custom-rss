            <p>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them. </p>

<p>The final 30 seconds of the trailer are an appalling display of sneakers kicking cars to death, flip-flops stamping on defenceless sandcastles, and stilettos flagrantly holding up traffic at zebra crossings. It's just as well the video is only a minute long, because the escalation curve is clear. If this were a four minute gameplay overview, the last third would consist of shoes vindictively toeing the Declaration Of Independence, or nudging lost kittens into jet engines.</p>
<p>Bambas! - yes, the exclamation mark is part of the title - is the work of Villena, Spain-based Devilish Games, who say it isn't just a game but "a tribute to urban culture". You can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Steam</a>. Come release day in 2025, the game will "break stereotypes with its non-linear narrative and environmental storytelling, where stories unfold around every corner". You will "discover hidden spots that hold secrets and characters that will lead you down unexpected paths".</p><p>The game's setting is "a vibrant, detailed Mediterranean coastal city where creativity rules and exploration is your passport to fun", a place of Jet Set Radio-ish abandon where "you'll need to navigate crosswalks, kick cans, balance on curbs, and pull off impossible jumps to complete hundreds of challenges". It all looks and sounds very jolly - far from the Qwoppy puzzler I was half-expecting from the press release, and more in keeping with the mayhem of Untitled Goose Game.</p>
<p>Complete those challenges, and you'll unlock "countless" shoes. I've never been a shoe collector, myself - I've never had the budget for it, but also, I don't have the imagination. Any shoes I own are doomed to be worn everyday from dawn till dusk until they lose all form and colour and become muddy teatowels, wrapped around my feet.</p>
<p>It occurs to me, after watching the trailer for Bambas!, that my shoes might resent this treatment, and wish to be free of me. I am looking at my current trainers as I type this, and wondering what they'd do if I were... out of the picture. Readers, I am telling you this because I fear to utter the words aloud: <em>it is possible that my shoes are conspiring against me</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
