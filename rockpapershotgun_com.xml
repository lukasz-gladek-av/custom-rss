You know what got announced a little over three years ago now? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. You know what hasn't had a single new trailer in that time? Ding ding ding! If you said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, you don't win anything because the direction of this bit was pretty obvious. The game still doesn't have a new trailer, by the way, but the series' official Blue Sky account did oh so generously offer up a handful of screenshots today which do show off some new bits (mostly).

In the pair of posts, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> wrote that they're "currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support."

In terms of the screenshots themselves, there's best boy Sora in his real-world look skating along some chains in a city, with some Heartless-like enemies beneath him. There's Strelitzia, the girl you would have seen in the first trailer, and a character that will mean absolutely nothing to you if you haven't played the mobile game. There's a couple more shots of Sora just… standing around. All in all, there's two actually notable screenshots.
</p>
<p>
One is the fact that you get to play as Mickey Mouse again, who's cheekily hanging out on top of a chandelier in a library. This'll likely be Scala ad Caelum, the last world you visit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, as Mr. Michael Mouse was sent there at the end of Melody of Memory (that's right, even the rhythm game has important cutscenes).
</p>
<p>
The other screenshot, interestingly, is of an old rotary phone. A few people believe this might be something akin to a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-are-wind-phones-and-how-do-they-help-with-grief-180985113/">wind phone</a>. These are often disconnected rotary phones found in the middle of nowhere, where people have one-way conversations with a loved one that's passed on. The trend of using them started in Japan too, and considering what happens to Sora at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3, I'm inclined to buy into this one.
</p>
<p>
If you're wondering why Square Enix showed off these new screenshots on a random Wednesday in May, it'll likely be to do with the fact the developer cancelled the series' next entry Missing Link <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-mobile-game-cancelled-but-its-not-all-bad-news-as-square-enix-teases-it-is-hard-at-work-on-kingdom-hearts-4">just yesterday</a>. This one was set to be a Pokemon Go-like mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you could make your own character. I imagine this cancellation has something to do with Square Enix's multiplatform plan they established last year, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-reiterates-plans-for-quality-over-quantity-and-multiformat-games-going-forward/">a point it doubled down on during its latest financial results</a>.
</p>
<p>
Any which way, I'll take a JPEG of a rotary phone and Mickey Mouse over silence. Thanks Nomura/ Square Enix's social team who probably stressed that they needed something to placate people!

Many are the minigames that threaten to be more entertaining than the games that host them, stealing the player’s attention like those flatworms that absorb snails from the inside. Tetra Master. Gwent. Fishing in any number of RPGs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSSGZ9O8RX4">The flushable sinks in Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Or how about Space Harrier, which has only ever existed as an arcade cabinet offering inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, these minigames escape the host's body and achieve a standalone eistence. It’s not <em>entirely</em> true to say this of Dicealot, which is based on Farkle, a dice game you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-play-dice"> may have played</a> inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>For Farkle is actually a real medieval dice game from the 12th century, in which you roll six dice and score by achieving certain combinations. Dicealot takes a few liberties with the premise: it introduces a frame narrative in which Queen Gwynevere is trying to save a bewitched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>, together with additional power and quest dice, acquired from mission to mission, that modify the basic rules. It’s a roguelite, in other words. I know, we haven’t played a lot of those lately. Here’s a trailer.

There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035330/Dicealot/">a demo on Steam</a> if you’d like to give it a whirl. I am keen on the presentation: it’s like an illuminated parchment and a cathode-ray TV had a baby, and the baby grew up and dabbled in art deco. 
</p>
<p>
The developers are Goodviewgames, who are based in based in Leeds and Bordeaux. I was born in Leeds and still have family in Yorkshire. I assure you that I discovered this after viewing and enjoying the trailer. Let it be known, developers and publishers, that you will not automatically earn my interest if you happen to be based in Leeds. Though if you do want to relocate there and host some studio visits, it’d mean I could see my dad more often. Ball's in your court.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into To The Restless Ruins</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> dungeon crawler where you build the dungeon as you go. I really enjoyed the demo, and the full game is out today. In a show of confidence I always appreciate, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877770/Into_the_Restless_Ruins/">the demo is also still available</a>. Launch trailer below. It's got a quote from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stylish-roguelite-into-the-restless-ruins-channels-classic-warhammer-quests-dungeon-crawling">one of my articles in it</a>, although they opted not to use the phrase "like hailstones battering the word 'bum' into soft cement" for some reason. Perplexing times we live in.</p>

<p>Joining the word 'bum' in my demo preview was some thoughts on how the concept initially reminded me of the first iteration of tabletop dungeon crawler Warhammer Quest, which used a randomised tile deck to keep you guessing about the layout of your subterranean environs. Things work a little differently here: you'll be trying to reach a goal by constructing your dungeon from a deck you can add more cards to after each run. The runs involve autobattling, although you can finesse it somewhat with positioning.</p>
<p>I actually think the automatic combat is the sensible choice here, though, because you haven't got a map, and it keeps your brainspace free for navigation. As your layout gets more complex, you end up memorising routes and building in such a way as to allow you to scoop up more rewards. Maybe create a little enclave of healing rooms so you can batter enemies for longer? Maybe something more devious. Don't tell me. That'll ruin your chittering schemes, ratman. I wasn't actually sure if I'd missed the map, initially, so I mentioned it the article, and designer Tony Gowland replied. Who's quoting who now, Ant Workshop!</p>
<p>"There’s no map while you’re adventuring," wrote Tony. "This was deliberate so that keeping your dungeon memorable as you build it is another thing players have to factor in. It’s by far the most controversial design element and we’re really happy it landed for you".</p>
<p>It most definitely did. Into the Restless Ruins is currently £12/€13/$13 on Steam. Bum bum, bum bum. Bum, bum. Bum.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
