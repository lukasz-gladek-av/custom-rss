            <p>Look, EA and Maxis, did you really have to do this? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s virtual humans, who've long been able to take solace in the fact that random virtual people in the street couldn't see absolutely everything their despotic overlords force them to do indoors, no longer have that privilege. The game's latest update has made glass walls for houses a thing.</p>
<p>You can also stick plants on roofs, to give your prisoners something nice to stare at through their transparent cells when you inevitably delete all of the doors and watch them die. Yep, I know the myriad crimes that've been perpetrated with pool stairs over the years, and this looks like it'll start a terrifying new chapter for sim cruelty.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-ep19bgu-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=84574&amp;ts=1751455982007">the notes</a> for the update - which lays some groundwork for a paid expansion pack that's set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-enchanted-by-nature-looks-perfect-for-cottagecore-lovers-on-tiktok-circa-2020">make fairy sims a thing</a> on July 10th - EA show these new glass walls being used to build a cosy greehouse. You can find them under the misc heading of the wall patterns section in build mode. How nice.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's only taken a look at Reddit less than 24 hours after the update went live for me to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lpfl1c/took_advantage_of_the_new_update/">a glass prison cell</a> someone's stuck a sim in. It's ok, they were just doing a one-off build inspired by the glass box <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a43215821/you-season-4-joe-goldberg-glass-cage/">from that Netflix serial killer series</a>. I'm sure no sims are about to be trapped in doorless see-through cages en-masse.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sims players have been pulling tricks with windows to create walls that are pretty much transparent for a while now, but you didn't have to cut out the middlemessing, EA. Our species invented opaque walls for a reason. I know, natural light and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the update also introduces the ability to stick certain plants on the roofs of houses, because when you pop down the garden centre and buy some hydrangeas, you definitely want to stick them somewhere that means watering'll require some chimney climbing or a big ladder. Other changes it brings include the introduction of a special inventory section where food'll be moved once it goes off, so you can definitely not make a point of feeding your sim it anyway and maniacally cackling at the consequences.</p>
<p>Alongside a wider inventory overhaul are updates to the game's notebook and household collections designed to make those menus easier to navigate, plus a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now go, and close the glass door to the glass office I definitely don't regret installing in my real life house on the way out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-sims-4-update-adds-glass-walls-and-i-hope-your-virtual-humans-throw-stones-at-you-from-their-see-through-prisons]]></content:encoded>
