            <p>
As someone who's never played a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> game, seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year confused me simply because I didn't know it was a prequel. I generally prefer to play things in release order, but I understand why Square Enix did it that way around, and why they subsequently announced a double remake of the first two games. The third one launched just last November, leaving 1 and 2 with a vague 2025 release window. Well, until today, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared that the pair of remakes will be launching October 30th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While the first couple of Dragon Quests are technically available on modern platforms like the Nintendo Switch and mobile, you can't actually get them on PC. That means when the remakes launch it'll be the first time any of us in computer land can play them (officially speaking, of course). As mentioned I've not played any of them, just a series I've not gotten to yet, but neither of them are meant to be very long (hence the packaging of them together), so this doesn't seem like the worst way to tackle them.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I know this shouldn't be treated as the definitive way to play them, I just also don't always get along with the rough edges of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. These'll likely have sanded off said edges, and that's just fine with me, I'll leave all that stat min-maxing to all you sickos out there.
</p>
<p>
There's also a version of the game coming aptly titled the Erdrick Trilogy which combines all three remakes together, if you've not picked the third one up yet. And if you own the full trilogy, you'll get a, uh, dog suit to wear in Dragon Quest 1, and a cat suit to wear in Dragon Quest 2. Sure!

            <p>
A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update is here, version 1.0.5, with this one mostly having a focus on parkour improvements. There are, however, a couple of collaborations that have arrived in the game too, one with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and another with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. We'll get to those in a second, for now let's take a look at those parkour tweaks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, you can jump now! Well, you can do a vertical jump to be specific, letting both Naoe and Yusuke hop in an upwards direction to grab ledges or overhangs within reach. There's also now a sprint toggle lock option, meaning as long as you're moving, you won't stop sprinting if you use the parkour up or down options.

<p>
Some enhanced back and side ejects have been added in too, specifically the distance and height of them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> noting that foot landings will be favoured over hand landings. Naoe specifically will have some new animations when she does a height-gaining side eject.
</p>
<p>
You'll find a good few new photo mode features alongside all of this, with things like the ability to change the time of day, playing music while you're tweaking your shots, the ability to save custom filters, and for PC specifically, a fullscreen option.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those collabs. The first is a Dead by Daylight event, which Ubisoft describes as follows: "As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threatâ€¦" You can start this new quest from your hideout once you've unlocked Yasuke, and once you've beaten it you'll get a trinket and banner.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the Balatro collab. That damn card game really has it's hooks in all of us, 'ey? This one is just a new trinket for Naoe and amulet for Yasuke called Winning Hand. These both offer a legendary perk that "gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders." How do you get these new items? "You will need to work together to figure out how to get it!" says Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
There's a bunch of other general fixes with this update to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game too, but you can read about all of those over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a>.
