"This is a game made by adults for adults," is a line that features in a recent interview with Ryan Hill, creative strategist at CI Games, talking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> in tandem with its Geoff's Night of Pretending to Like Video Games gameplay reveal trailer. The reason this line comes up is because the upcoming sequel is a violent one, one that hopes to be bloodier and gorier than its predecessor, to the point that you can, if you like, chop off any limb you can see in the game.
</p>
<p>
"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-limb-can-be-removed-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-publisher-discusses-dismemberment-lore-and-learnings-for-the-sequel-the-game-awards-2025-ign">IGN</a> in said interview. "This is a game made by adults for adults, and we didn't want to dilute the brutality or intensity of that experience.

"Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."
</p><p>
Hill also made sure to clarify that again, yes, "every limb can be removed." You can see some of that in the gameplay trailer up above, and yeah, that sure does look like some limb slicing, though how that affects moment to moment gameplay isn't immediately apparent just yet.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder Lords of the Fallen 2 is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ci-games-reveal-new-lords-of-the-fallen-sniper-ghost-warrior-and-a-major-new-action-rpg">follow-up to Lords of the Fallen</a> (2023), not Lords of the Fallen (2014), in case you lost track of which Lords of the Fallen came out when, and maybe where. The sequel is supposedly launching in 2026, but if I've learned anything in my time doing this work, it is that betting on dates is as clever as pissing in the wind.

            <p>
How about that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-official-control-2-is-control-resonant-a-paranatural-melee-brawler-with-shapeshifting-hittin-sticks">Control Resonant</a>! What was previously referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> now has its own name, and its own protagonist, Dylan Faden, the tongues-speaking brother of the first game's heroine Jesse. Gone is her shapeshifting gun too, replaced with a shapeshifting bit of metal instead. The horrors of the Oldest House have spilled out into New York City, Jesse is MIA, and Dylan must bash his way through it all to find her in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>-esque manner. Interesting enough a setup, but I am bothered by one thing: Remedy say you don't need to play the first game to play this one.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/control-resonant-brings-a-new-paranatural-crisis-to-ps5-out-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that came with the official reveal last night, co-creative director at Remedy Mikael Kasurinen laid it out for us. "You don’t need to have played the first Control to experience Resonant," he wrote. "It’s a new story and a fresh entry point into Remedy’s world of the Federal Bureau of Control - though returning players will recognize familiar echoes of Jesse’s path and the mysteries binding these two siblings together."
</p>
<p>
This isn't a surprising thing in that by the time Control Resonant releases next year, if it does, it will have been seven years since the first one came out (the same amount of time that has passed in-world). It's just quite frustrating, because when the studio said <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/">the same thing about Alan Wake 2</a>, it was only true on a technical level. Sure, it was easy enough to follow, but there really is so much to it that you'll need to have played the first one to fully appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Seven years in-world is obviously a convenient amount of time to help justify the lack of a need to play a previous game. It is just a frustrating trend that has been born out of a desperation to, I assume, make certain sales figures. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth's co-director even said <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1665705101196136448">you don't have to play Remake beforehand to enjoy it</a>, which is nonsense of the highest order.
</p><p>
Sequels are not an inherently bad thing, and if you can only make them in a fashion where you need to bring in new people, thusly potentially alienating what drew people in in the first place, I question why you're making a sequel at all. Hell, Remedy are trying to build a whole universe here - why not be brave and go the whole hog, try something actually new?
</p>
<p>
Mayhaps I am being a curmudgeon, I would like to note that I do think the actiony, whompy bits look Sick as Heck, and will be eager to check it out whenever it does end up releasing next year. But I won't pretend that I don't need to play Control.
