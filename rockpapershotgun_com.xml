            <p>BioWare currently has no plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> expansions, according to reports. Instead the studio will support the fantasy RPG with smaller updates and otherwise turn their full attention towards Mass Effect 5.

<p>Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">report</a> that there are no plans for DLC, in favour of focusing on the next Mass Effect, in a piece speaking with Bioware creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>Although Rolling Stone confirm no specific details, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">report</a> that they understand BioWare intend to release quality-of-life and smaller content updates for The Veilguard, but nothing more.
</p>
<p>BioWare have traditionally supported their games with substantial story DLC. The previous game in the series, Inquisition, received several, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-dlc">Jaws Of Hakkon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-dlc">The Descent</a>, and an epilogue, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Trespasser</a>.
</p>
<p>That said, video games are harder than ever to make and The Veilguard already took Nic 50 hours to complete for his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. I am personally fine with story-based games being complete at launch, and not getting a bunch of extraneous bottle episodes and post-credits really-real endings post-release.</p>
<p>(Except for Cyberpunk 2077 which I wish had ten more in-development expansions about Idris Elba looking at me sadly.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
