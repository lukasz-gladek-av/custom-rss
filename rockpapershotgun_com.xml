            <p>
I confess, after reading the comments on yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">Endless Legend 2 early access impressions</a>, I am mortally afeared that I'm one of those accursed "positive outliers" I keep reading about in the Gamer Witchfinder Almanac. Seemingly, a fair portion of you were turned off by the recent Steam demo. You may be interested, then, to read specifics about how Amplitude have changed the game in response to demo feedback.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3407390/view/496081198026588764?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, here's what they think you liked. Firstly, the Tidefall mechanic, whereby the ocean retreats periodically to reveal extra playable terrain, and the regular Monsoons that sweep the land. "This was a core element of the game, and we were happy to see it having a real impact," the devs write, adding that they tinkered a lot with the quantity of Monsoons and Tidefalls. Apparently, there were once eight smaller Tidefalls to every game of Endless Legend 2, so many that players began ignoring them.
</p>
<p>
They also reckon you're keen on the asymmetrical faction design - "always a focus of Amplitude" - and that you're mostly enjoying the art and sound, including the map design, characters and jingles for stuff like minor factions, or the weird echoey thudding you might hear during Monsoons.
</p>
<p>
Now for weaknesses. According to Amplitude, the bulk of the negative feedback concerned the user interface. "A quarter of reviews mentioned UI and only 30% of those comments were positive," they note. "In reading all your feedback we realize it's not as simple as making a few changes and we are looking at something larger. There are instances where we displayed the wrong or not enough information. There were UI and text bugs to fix and we think more is needed here, which will take some time."
</p><p>
In particular, they're looking at making the city screens more intelligible. "Adjacency, leveling districts, managing population, and having clear decisions on what to build next were all muddy," the devs write. This is a "flow issue", apparently, which I guess refers to how your eyeballs and attention move from one UI element to the next in the course of urban management.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, they might change up Districts so that you can select them from a construction list like Improvements, rather than picking a tile to build on first. "This will take time to change and won't be in the initial Early Access, but we will be sharing concepts with you to get feedback," the devs comment.
</p>
<p>
To belatedly update my impressions from yesterday, I haven't had much of a problem with the UI in the early access build, but there were definitely a couple of moments this week when the verdant tile designs made it hard to discern, say, city centres, or units inside cities. It's definitely rather busy, which is to be expected for a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game with such florid factions and a turbulent expanding map. I also sometimes forgot what right-click and left-click do in different contexts. I don't consider any of these deal-breakers, however.
</p>
<p>
Following on from those UI thoughts, Amplitude acknowledge that some players have found the colourful world a little too hallucinogenic. They've addressed this in early access by making city foundations clearer, so you know to build there, while getting rid of bugs (not the Necrophage) that caused blurriness, and adding more graphics options.  They've also reduced the colour saturation of the terrain a little and made the all-important hexagonal grid lines more prominent, while shrinking certain fancier vegetation that players kept confusing with Anomalies. 
</p><p>
"It's a difficult balance between providing a lush, detailed world where you can see the leaves blow in the wind during monsoon, and still not have to strain or be confused when trying to see information you need to play," the developers observe.
</p>
<p>
In my impressions of Endless Legend 2, I was most critical of the character writing. Demo players were also iffy about this side of the game. In their Steam post, Amplitude note that there are many more words in Endless Legend 2 than the 2014 original, including reams of character dialogue. "We want heroes to feel personal and deep," they write. "They may be members of your council, have their own friends and enemies, and they talk directly to you and each other. But this additional granularity also came with issues. 
</p>
<p>
"For Early Access we have updated the presentation of the dialog, we are cutting lines and events to focus on only the best and most suitable," the devs continue. "In some cases, the wrong character would say something, or a character it didn't make sense for, which we are fixing." I definitely picked up on a few instances of the latter, but my overarching problem with the character writing is that the focus on characters doesn't do certain factions justice. The Necrophage are a horde, not a cast. The Aspect are a reef, not an ensemble. That's what I find attractive about them conceptually, at least.
</p>
<p>
Endless Legend 2 launches into early access on 22nd September. It'll start off with five factions. They're planning to add a sixth plus multiplayer and custom faction support before the 1.0 release next year. If you end up disliking it please don't burn my house down.

There was really only one way to enhance the prospect of an Antarctic open world game with a choice of playable penguins that's actually a fractious retelling of Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness, created by the developers of Umurangi Generation. And that one way was to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veselekov.bsky.social/post/3lz56tdcfg22z">hire Lenval Brown</a>, narrator for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s special edition, to voice the first proper trailer. And also, make the trailer look a lot like John Carpenter's The Thing. No further words from me are needed or desired. Find the footage below.

I have been informed by management that being a website editor, I am contractually obliged to provide further words. So be it! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-next-for-the-umurangi-generation-devs-why-a-game-about-penguins-and-people-going-mad-on-a-mountain-of-course">Announced in June</a>, Penguin Colony is a short narrative adventure in which an explorer thrown outside Time by the Old Ones seeks aid by possessing or manipulating the local penguins. You will slide and slip around the surface of the bergs and also, travel deep beneath the ice, which is generally not a great place to be in anything Lovecraftian.
</p>
<p>
This being a game from the people behind Umurangi Generation, a brilliant political artwork which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-snapping-umurangi-generations-dazzling-jet-set-radio-cityscape">deals in themes of decolonization from the perspective of a Māori shutterbug</a>, I imagine there will be some critique of Lovecraft's notions about foreign parts and people. I don't have the linguistic knowledge to confirm this, but based on some quick online research, part of the trailer also appears to be voiced in Māori.
</p><p>
The last penguin game I had the pleasure of was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, which Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/faaast-penguin-is-that-super-mario-64-level-where-you-race-a-penguin-except-now-the-penguin-is-39-other-players">summarised</a> as "that Super Mario 64 level where you race a penguin except now the penguin is 39 other players". There are no Old Ones in Faaast Penguin, but it did launch <em>almost exactly a year ago to the day</em> - a temporal alignment that surely reflects the dire intervention of some cosmic Cthulhuin or Penghulu, tracing cryptic sentences with its immense pygostyle (tail bone) upon the snows of unreality. 
</p>
<p>
While researching penguin anatomy in order to construct that stupid skit about the penguin god, I discovered that a "penguin diagram" is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_diagram">some kind of quantum field McGuffin</a> referring to the "flavours" of "quarks". Coincidence? None of this is coincidence, foolish child! The universe is ending and Lenval Brown is here to preside over the collapse. Let's see if we can distil any further cortex-flensing insight from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unlock different penguins to replay the game as," it comments. "Different penguins have different abilities and challenges. For example playing as a baby penguin means you can fit in smaller gaps but you cannot swim."
</p>
<p>
Well, that seems harmless enough. Please try to distract yourself from the coming doom by telling me which is your favourite penguin. If you wrote anything other than Rockhopper then sorry, you are wrong. Alternatively, exacerbate your awareness of the coming doom by rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAoONl2P8fw">Thingu</a>.

            <p>To invert or not to invert? The question of whether to flip the Y-axis in games is often answered with recollections of childhood habits and/or varyingly smug declarations of which joystick setting is 'better'. Now, though, a cognitive research study posits that our control preferences are less about whether or not we played GoldenEye after school and more about the innate quirks of our brains.</p>
<p>As reported by Keith Stuart at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think">The Guardian</a>, Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke’s <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-025-00626-5">paper</a> 'Why axis inversion? Optimizing interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments' details their experiments into control inversion choices. After answering a questionnaire about whether and why they think they use invert controls or not, participants were tasked to, as Corbett puts it, "mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical '<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/simon-effect">Simon effect</a>' where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button."</p>
<p>These experiments, the study claims, indicated that none of the participants’ stated reasons for rejecting or embracing inversion "had anything to do" with their actual choice. "It turns out," Corbett says, "the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks."</p>
<p>Or, as Stuart puts it, "It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space." And the speed factor doesn’t mean that electing to invert is a skill issue either, as the study adds that while non-inverters would flip their images at a faster pace, they’d make more mistakes than the cautious inverters, resulting in an overall equal accuracy rate.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I suspect my C grade in GCSE Biology isn’t quite enough to let me give a learned interpretation of these findings, but it sure sounds like the desire to invert is based mainly on unconscious brainworkings – hardly sure footing for any "No, MY way is better" reasoning. Though on a personal level it’s nice to know, as someone who’s always inverted the Y axis on thumbstick controls but can’t remember a reason why, that I don’t actually <em>need</em> a reason. It’s just how I perceive objects in 3D space, guys. I shall continue to go around gaming trade shows, flipping the sticks at all the demo booths and forgetting to reset them, thus leaving a trail of harmless inconveniences like a hallway full of slightly tilted paintings. And it’ll all be fine, because it was basically an accident of birth.</p><p>Then again, the study doesn’t entirely reject the impact of learned behaviour, and in fact suggests we try practicing the opposite of our control preference – just in case we’ve convinced ourselves to stick with a method that isn't a cognitive match.</p>
<p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot," Corbett argues. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better.</p>
<p>"A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I’m running a quick test of something on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I leave the Y-axis uninverted just because I can’t be bothered to delve into the menus to change it. Does that count?</p>

            <p>The great 'dematuring' of videogames continues with reports that Valve are now forbidding "post-launch NSFW content" for games on Steam, even those that are already "adult-only". That's according to Crimson Delight Games, the developers of fantasy RPG Tales of Legendary Lust: Aphrodisia. They launched it on September 15th with adult content warnings, after submitting it to Valve's review process in August, and had planned to add sexy scenes through updates while working on a big DLC expansion for 2026. 
</p>
<p>These updates are not going to happen anymore, apparently because everybody's favourite PG-rated cartoon villains, global payment networks, are putting pressure on Valve. Instead, the updates will need to be submitted as proper official DLC so that Valve can give them a formal review.</p> <!--more-->
<p>This will likely mean more work for the devs and potentially, release delays, compared to the relative ease of publishing an update or patch - as Valve <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/updates">explain in their FAQ</a>, "Steam makes it easy to patch your game or add content at any time that you need to in order to best serve your audience on your schedule".

<p>"We were told all new adult content for our game has to go through DLC, presumably so it can be reviewed and approved," the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nio69j/valve_no_longer_allows_postlaunch_nsfw_content/">wrote in response to a Reddit post</a> about the situation this week. We don't know the inner workings of Valve / Steam, but we're in a couple of NSFW dev communities and these new rules weren't in place before the Collective Shout uproar and subsequent payment processors' censorship."
</p><p>If you're new to Collective Shout, they're an Australian activist group who campaign against "the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture", and are also affiliated with conservative groups who campaign against sex work and pornography at large.</p>
<p>Back in July, Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit</a> for stampeding Mastercard, Visa and other payment processing companies and networks into forbidding the transaction of a vast number of sexually themed or otherwise "NSFW" adult games on Steam and Itch, including a lot of games from queer developers. Collective Shout have yet to properly explain which individual games they consider unfit for sale and why.
</p>
<p>Steam and Itch have now changed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their</a> <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">policies</a> to give the payment networks some control over what counts as acceptable "adult" material. They have also delisted or removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">of games</a>, with Itch electing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">seek out new payment partners</a> while revising their catalogue. Valve are reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-appear-to-be-blocking-mature-themed-games-from-steam-early-access-release">denying the release of "mature" games under Steam early access</a>, possibly because (to echo Crimson Delight's point above) the platform holder needs to be able to review the finished work before approving it for sale. I say 'reportedly' and 'possibly' because Valve still haven't made a formal comment on these recent events. I'll ask them again now.
</p>
<p>In the Reddit thread about the rejected NSFW updates, Crimson Delight have only good things to say about Valve's handling of the situation. "I have to say the reviewer was kind and forthcoming, we didn't feel threatened or bullied in any way, and we got the feeling they were trying to do their best to help devs navigate the process," developer Frenzin writes. "But the fact of the matter is that Valve has payment processors breathing down their neck, and the rules keep getting stricter as time goes on." 
</p><p>"Valve isn't the problem here," Frenzin continues. "The big credit card companies are. If anything, Valve has stood up to them and pushed back. They could've simply nuked the 18+ section of Steam, but they didn't, they stuck up for developers. Obviously adult games make Valve money, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of Steam's catalogue. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> itself probably earned Valve more than most NSFW titles put together.
</p>
<p>"Given that we're erogame devs, we're against any sort of censorship (as long as the content isn't sexualizing minors or nonconsensual in any way)," the developer comments. "But it's important to understand where the real problem lies, and it's not with Valve."
</p>
<p>My very Lukewarm Take regarding the on-going NSFW/mature game crackdown is that people should be allowed to get their rocks off to whatever responsibly created fictitious media they choose in the absence of evidence that they are doing harm, and large finance corporations with no actual mandate to serve the public interest shouldn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">play the part of moral sentinel</a>.
</p>
<p>I'd flesh that argument out with reference to Tales of Legendary Lust, but my efforts are hindered by the UK's new Online Safety Act, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-now-require-uk-steam-users-to-verify-their-ages-using-a-credit-card">requires me to verify my age</a> to visit the game's Steam page and visit the developer's subreddit (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/games-on-steam-can-no-longer-be-updated-with-nsfw-content-post-launch-but-valve-isnt-the-problem-developer-says/">Automaton</a> for being the messenger). I don't have a credit card for Steam verification, and Reddit's camera age verification widget seems to think that my age defies categorisation. Which, you know, fair dos. You can find a SFW version of the game on <a href="https://crimsondelightgames.itch.io/tales-of-legendary-lust-aphrodisia-sfw">Itch</a>, though.</p>
