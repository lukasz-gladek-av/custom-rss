Tonight's Future Games Show obviously wasn't about any one game or studio in particular, but funnily enough, it did open and close with games from (technically) one developer. The show started things off with a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3494520/Lost_Rift/">Lost Rift</a>, a supernatural, survival, PvPvE extraction game - that's a lot of things - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/people-can-fly">People Can Fly</a>. In case you were wondering, this is what became of Project Victoria which was shelved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">only three months ago</a>. Weirdly enough, the show then ended with the series that put PCF on the map: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/painkiller">Painkiller</a>. Or, a remake of it anyway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
When I say that these two announcements were technically from one developer, I mostly do mean it in that PCF made the original gory, hellish first-person shooter, whereas this remake is being made by Anshar Studios, a studio mostly known for assisting other developers - it's helped out on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, and even People Can Fly's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a>.

The Painkiller remake looks like it'll still have plenty of enemies to mow down in increasingly brutal ways, you'd expect that of a game with a name like that, but there's some key changes here that make it more than just a fresh lick of paint. For one, there'll be four characters to play as, each with their own passive ability, and more notably, co-op will be a bigger component this time around. Makes sense with the different playable characters, though I'm normally hesitant about remakes at the best of times, so I'm curious how that emphasis will go down. There's also tarot cards that grant buffs, currencies to earn, skins to unlock, all stuff that mostly just sounds like padding, truth be told.
</p>
<p>
Painkiller doesn't have a precise release date just yet, but it's currently slated to come out sometime Fall 2025, and it's already available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Steam</a>. I guess <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> isn't guaranteed to be the biggest medieavally, gothicy boomer shooter this year after all.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</a>, is coming up to three years now, but at the Future Games Show this evening, all these years on, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> announced that the strategy action game will be getting its first bit of DLC, War Sails. If you can't gather from the name, featured image above, and trailer below, the DLC is all about boats; sailing 'em, fighting with 'em, trading with 'em, you name it, these boats can do it (within reason).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
War Sails quite notably is introducing a Viking-inspired faction, where you can do your usual thing of deciding to trade, recruit, or fight them (once you've made your way to the Northern Kingdom anyway). Based on details from a press release, sailing won't be as easy as 1, 2, 3 as you'll have wind and water physics to deal with.

<p>
But one thing that does sound neat, and you can catch a glimpse of in the trailer above, is that you'll be able to ram into and board enemy ships, as well as destroy their oars and tear their sails. Sounds like a slightly more in-depth take on what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has going on, and I'm quite fond of that game.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will have 18 ships to choose from, all of which handle differently and can be upgraded, and you'll be able to unlock more banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armour, that sort of thing. You've not long to wait either, as it's set to be released this coming June 17th.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, more free updates are planned too that'll bring in some new mechanics like a stealth and disguise system, a Parley feature, and general combat improvements. Best keep your eyes peeled for that one.

            <p>Frosthaven - the sequel to Cephalofair's knock-a-horse-out massive board game - is getting a digital version from Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games. You can <a href="http://playfrosthaven.com/">sign up here</a> to its closed beta kicking off March 27th, and it's coming to Steam early access later this year.</p>
<p>Like predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>, Frosthaven is a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you'll resolve story events and encounters between dungeon delving, retiring old characters and unlocking new classes as you progress. New to Frosthaven is a fleshed-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> that has you build up and  protect an outpost, while dealing with harsh seasons and invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I really <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">enjoyed Gloomhaven digital</a>, mostly for not getting in the tabletop game's way to much, but also for not requiring glue to put third party token trays together. Core to the game is tactical card combat where everything from movement to spellcasting is dictated by your hand. You pick two cards a turn from a deck you customise as you progress, and select actions from the top of one card and the bottom of the other. Each card also has an initiative value, so you're constantly assessing threats to see if you can pull off slower moves, or even whether you're better off sacrificing advanced plays altogether and opting for the generic attack or move option each card offers.</p>
<p>You can get old cards back by resting, but this means burning others. It's all crunchier than a Crunchy bar dredged in grit then left out to dry under an alien sun that emanates ultra-crunchy crunch rays, but  also full of character and a bit of roleplaying.</p>
<p>Designer Isaac Childres has consulted on the digital version throughout development, and Snapshot say they've spent a lot of time getting the feel of the world right in motion. In a preview session I attended recently, Director Hristo Petkov gave me the example of the Snowdancer. She's a bestial, graceful hero character whose dance-like fighting style the team had originally animated as similar to Capoeira - before Childres told them he'd imagined it closer to ballet. There's an entire environment named the Metallic Ruins in the digital version that only exists as prose in the board game, and they've worked closely with Childres to bring it to life here.</p>
<p>They're keen to highlight a more robust tutorial this time, too - also designed by Childres - alongside some more granular difficulty selections, including ones that prevent you getting exhausted and failing. The early access version has 35 quests across the first two acts of the game, with the full game planned to have over 130. There's also 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. I'm excited! I never ended up buying Frosthaven, since I'd also need to start sleeping on the box to justify the space investment, so this suits me just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
