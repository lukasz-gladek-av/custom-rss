            <p>
Alright folks, quiz time: what's the single best feature in the GTA series? I'll give you a second. Got your answer done? If you wrote anything but the in-game radio, you'd be dead wrong, obviously it's listening to boppin' tunes as you crash into lamp posts for the umpteenth time, there's nothing else it could be. I love an in-game radio, and as it turns out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> of all games will include one (didn't know they had radio on Arrakis).
</p>

<p>
Best of all though is the fact that the in-game radio will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546731472820633915">actually feature music from the original Dune games</a>, the pair of games released in 1992, Dune and Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis. I'd also like to highlight that the soundtrack for the first one even has its own name, Dune: Spice Opera, which is just lovely. It even received a remaster last year apparently, so you'll have some crispy tunes to enjoy as you travel the desert planet (sadly, co-composer Stéphane Picq passed away just this February).

There's apparently three channels to peruse on the Communinent as it's been dubbed, like Harvester Radio, a station catered to the "commoner workforce." This one will be where you'll be able to listen to music, but also get some tips for survival and even ads, apparently. They're everywhere these days! There's also official Harkonnen and Atreides channels, though maybe stay away if you're susceptible to propaganda.
</p>
<p>
The in-game radio is fun, but including music from the original Dune games is just such a lovely touch. Most people obviously think of the newer films, the OG David Lynch version, and of course the books themselves, so it's a cute way of acknowledging another aspect of the sci-fi series' history. I'm not big on MMOs generally, but this might be enough to get me to give it a go at the very least.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amplitude-announce-endless-legend-2-an-oceanic-4x-with-manor-lords-outfit-hooded-horse-as-publisher">decidedly oceanic</a>, with seas that shift and retreat to reveal new areas over the course of a campaign, so it makes sense that at least one of the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game's new factions should be aquatic-themed. Say hello to the Aspects, and say hello to their coral. You'll be able to say hello to their coral because it is, in fact, a hivemind - a biomechanical reef that provides access to a gestalt intelligence called the Chorus, and which extends across their territory much like the Creep of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>'s Zerg, but in a less obviously menacing way.

"In terms of gameplay, the Aspects are an economic and diplomatic empire focused on cooperation over conquest," explains a press release from developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a> and publishers Hooded Horse. "Their main unique trait is their coral terrain - instead of claiming territories via outposts, the Aspects first place Coral Spores that will slowly spread coral to other tiles. These can be turned into cities, but they also serve as nodes for coral growth across the map." 
</p>
<p>
Yes. Yes. This is very much my cup of picturesque-but-insidious. Coral spores also extract dust, the game's magic resource, from their surroundings, while healing and accelerating your units and letting them cross water tiles. Best of all, they infest the minds of your rivals, making them better-disposed towards you. One way this happens is that other empires can exploit any coral growing on their territory for dust, which in turn lets the Aspect player see what they're seeing, and makes it easier to sway those empires in diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude have written a big <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/965">forum post</a> explaining their inspirations for the faction's visual design (coral aside, their architecture calls on influences from central Asia) and playstyle. "For them, we wanted to move away from the classical trope of diplomatic pacifist faction and make them something more like 'deal with the devil'," the designers write. "They don't want this world to be safer but manipulate people for their own good.
</p>
<p>
"At first, we wanted to make them evil landlords, capturing territories then selling them to other empires," the post continues. "This idea evolved into the Coral growing toward other empires' assets and giving to the Aspect the possibility to sign some specific treaties and get additional resources.
</p>
<p>
"The main difficulty dealing with the development of this faction was the fact that the Coral is a common resource shared by all Aspect empires in the game. This creates drastic changes in how you will play this faction whether there is another Aspect empire in your game or not." Intriguing.
</p>
<p>
As for the Aspect at war, they're big on cooperation with a varied roster of "swarming scouts", "steadfast archers" and "powerful flying behemoths". One key overarching mechanic is that when an Aspect unit defends for a turn, it confers attack boosts on allies. So they are great counterpunchers, in short. If only real-life coral reefs were this resilient.
</p>
<p>
I really like this crafty and unpleasant approach to the idea of a diplomacy faction. It's certainly channelling the spirit of the first game's faction design, which (for example) cast dragons against type by sort of turning them into the UN.
</p>
<p>
But where is my faction of no-nonsense warmongering builder-bastards, I hear you cry? That would probably be <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/964-kin-of-sheredyn-spotlight">the Kin of Sheredyn</a>, a band of cyberpunk Romans who are the remnants of a fallen interstellar empire. They're great at shield walls, hench automatons, and staying under their city cap because they think it's uncouth to expand too much. I haven't dug into the detail yet, but they feel like Endless Legend 2's equivalent for the first game's Vaulters.
</p>
<p>There will be two other factions ready to go for Endless Legend 2's early access launch this year, with two more planned for the 1.0 version. Any hopes for the remaining empires? I always liked the first game's Roving Clans, who found their cities on massive beetles. Perhaps the new game will harbour an equivalent who live inside whales.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Have you ever woken up and thought to yourself "I'd like to be a bear, or perhaps a moose, just for like, a little bit"? Oddly specific thing to think about first thing in the morning, but <strong>Striden</strong> has you covered at least. It's a looter shooter, yes, it's a survival game, sure, it's a team-based game, why not! Except sometimes, for some reason, you can just turn into different animals to fight your opponents, like a radioactive bear, which I think is very silly, but in a wonderful kind of way. And, as developer 5 Fortress announced today, it's getting an open beta this weekend so you can see what it's like for yourself.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a couple of new modes being introduced with the beta, the first being transmit mode. This one is PvP, and sees you duking it out with other players across "three intense maps in a fast-paced objective mode." Presumably this one involves moving something around, given the name. There's also a PvE mode which sees you trying to hold out against "relentless waves of enemies." More bears? No idea! I hope not, I don't like the idea of gunning down a bear.

5 Fortress also shared some of the more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2052970/view/536595840131663106?l=english">specific changes coming with the open beta</a> last month, like how the construction system has had a rework, namely introducing the ability to destroy enemy constructions, and the need to repair your construction tool to fix breached doors and windows. Sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, but the game isn't even in early access yet, there's time to change things.
</p>
<p>
Each class now has three unique construction items they can build too, and a vault/ mantle system is in the works, but that one might not be in the open beta. The open beta itself starts tomorrow, April 4th, at 4:00 PM CEST, and finishes on April 6th at 12:00 AM CEST, and there'll be another test the weekend after from April 11th to 13th. Can't wait to see what other mostly regular animals that you can turn into get added in future updates.
</p>
<p>
