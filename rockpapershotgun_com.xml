            <p>Fresh off of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">releasing the massive mod's first DLC</a> earlier this week, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> have confirmed that they've still got no plans to port it to the next-gen update version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. There is, however, one factor that could lead them to reconsider doing so.</p>
<p>Since Team FOLON's take on a post-apocalytic English capital released last summer, playing it has required downgrading your copy of Fallout 4 to an older iteration released prior to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">April 2024's next-genning of Bethesda's RPG</a>. With the next-gen update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">arriving out of the blue just ahead of Fallout: London's planned initial release</a>, the modders opted to put it out on this older version for stability reasons, following a delay that allowed them to explore their options.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the downgrade requirement being raised again on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1422862310489325580">Fallout: London's Discord server</a> yesterday, project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter weighed in to make clear Team FOLON's current stance on it. "We have the skill to put it on the next-gen [version], we just do not want [to]," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The current next-gen [iteration] has issues Bethesda Game Studios still [hasn't] fixed and would likely be broken by any future update that they may also do on a whim," the modder continued. "Thus, we have no plan to move it to the next-gen. If however, BGS allows console access for mods of this scale, then that is a potential different conversation."</p><p>Given the much tighter restrictions/limitations console mods have long had compared to PC, it'd take a substantial change to make a Fallout: London port possible, at least if you wanted the mod to be anywhere near as large and complex as the current version of it is. So, more of a pipedream at this point, but something it's still cool to see Team FOLON leaving the door open for.</p>
<p>For now, downgrading on PC's still your only option if you fancy checking out the mod's freshly released add-on Rabbit and Pork. It's not a problem if you're playing via a GOG-bought copy of Fallout 4 due to that storefront's built-in downgrader, but for those with Steam copies, you'll need to use the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1">downgrader mod</a> Team FOLON put out. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">Starting a fresh save is also a requirement</a> the first time you fire up after installing the fresh update which delivers the DLC.</p>

            <p>
Am I good at chess? I'll take no for $1500, Alex. But do I love a funky twist on games that are older than time itself? You bet your bottom dollar I do! Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/below-the-crown">Below the Crown</a>, a chess video game that is also a roguelike, ,and is also a turn-based strategy game, and is also a dungeon crawler on top of that. It's a lot! It also works very well, and in a demo that just came out today (alongside an early access release date), there's a suggestion of something a touch more… unsettling… going on under the hood.
</p>
<p>
In Below the Crown, you are a wizard who is working to get The Emperor the gold he knows is down in the dungeon below his castle. This wizard version of you places a single king on a chess board in each run, with a selection of other, occasionally remixed versions of classic pieces at your disposal. You slowly add pieces to the board as you try to strategise your way towards taking down opposing kings, adding abilities to your various pieces as you go room by room. Sometimes you'll be offered the opportunity to buy certain useful cards too, like one that will freeze an enemy piece in place for five turns.
</p>
<p>
It's chess! And it's not chess. The important thing is that the essence of the age-old game is there, that feeling of thinking where you're going to place which piece where, albeit in a refreshingly different way. Though, it definitely is a game that is smarter than me, at least when it comes to chess, because I really would like to stress I'm pants at actual chess. Still fun though! And then there's the creepy bits.
</p>
<p>
In between rounds, you might get asked to do things like placing a marker on a graph that reads loneliness on the Y axis and anxiety on the X axis. Upon beating a run I was asked to rank my pieces based on how I felt about them, and was then questioned on my choices afterwards. Methinks there is a bit more than just retro, roguelike chess going on here, and I'm curious to find out more.
</p><p>
Which I'll be able to do soonish! As developer Misfits Attic (who also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a>) shared that Below the Crown will be launching into early access next month, November 10th. Better keep practicing at regular chess in the meantime so I don't totally suck at this twisted video game version of it.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, whether it ends up being a good game or not, is clearly a confident one. You have to be brave to so blatantly, we'll say, borrow from so many different games. Like many anime-esque games of its ilk, it will live and die by its characters (which, by the way, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/locking-characters-behind-gacha-would-have-clashed-with-anantas-intended-playstyle-and-high-degree-of-freedom-producer-explains/">you won't have to gacha roll for</a>), of which it seems to have in spades judging from that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">first gameplay trailer</a>. These characters will all play differently too, and according to Ananta's producer Ash Qi, the dev team wants you to think of them like Avengers members. Comparing your new thing to an older, widely loved thing is always a safe move!
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/gta-and-spider-man-are-big-shoes-to-fill-but-ananta-producer-decides-to-raise-expectations-even-higher-with-marvel-avengers-comparisons-they-are-the-protagonists-of-their-own-stories/">GamesRadar</a>, Qi said he believes "many of the characters in the game could be protagonists in their own game." Qi went on to explain that they're "trying to create a big storyline that will evolve, giving the characters focus, which will add new characters and new cities to explore. Take Marvel as an example; there are many different heroes and champions in The Avengers. 
</p>
<p>
"However, characters like Captain America and Spider-Man have their own storylines, separate from the larger plot, and they are the protagonists of their own stories, each with their unique missions." Qi goes on to note that this approach, of trying to make each character stand out, is their attempt of keeping them in focus - not to mention a feature they're working on where several characters can all fight other enemies at once.
</p>
<p>
One point I do take slight umbrage with is that Qi also said the studio is trying to "achieve a design that feels unique compared to other RPG games." Sure, there might not be many RPG games like this one, but there are even just some animations that seem uncomfortably similar to other games.
</p>
<p>
I still have my reservations about Ananta, but I'm still curious to find out how it actually shapes up… whenever that is.
