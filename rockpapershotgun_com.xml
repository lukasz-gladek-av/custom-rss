            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed a new major update, which introduces "the largest and harshest" island in the survival game's history, together with new tower bosses and new pals. As for everything else… that's a secret, but you can expect a "large amount of new content", and we've got a few images to speculate over.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Going off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236002110311119?l=english">Steam announcement</a>, Palworld's next major update lands sometime in December. With it comes a new island "six times the size of Sakurajima", which was the area added in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huge-palworld-update-adds-arena-multiplayer-a-new-island-oil-rigs-and-a-new-pal-from-outer-space">last major update</a>. It'll include new species, but not just any new species - "vicious" species. This suggests that the pals will be nasty and horrible, as opposed to pals.</p>
<p>Let's look at the three images (the only images we have) of the new update.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first looks like some form of gold coin heist, with various pals marching out of a cave with overflowing coin sacks in tow. A new way to earn large amounts of money? At what cost, though? (probably death).</li>
<li>The second image features a golden stag beetle fella in an autumnal forest. He's absolutely not going down easily.</li>
<li>The third image features a crystalline pool that lies within a vast cavern. A precious resource?</li>
</ul>
<p>Elsewhere, a collaboration with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> is in the works for 2025. No other details on that, but I'd imagine some assorted monsters from the Terrariaverse will shift over into Palworld.</p>
<p>Pocketpair have got bigger things to worry about even than islands right now: they're being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement. Let me hit you with a quick TLDR (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">here's the more detailed rundown</a>). When Palworld first launched, some Pokémon players thought that Palworld had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">broken Pokémon's copyright</a>. After some time, in December Nintendo were then like, "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">have some legal proceedings</a>", although it wasn't clear which bits of Palworld they were going after.</p><p>Earlier this month, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">revealed three patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are taking them to court about</a>. The Pokémon lads are also seeking an injunction against the game, potentially blocking sales. It's not clear what the outcome will be, but Pocketpair aren't backing down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
