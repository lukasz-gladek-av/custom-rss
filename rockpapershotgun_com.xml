            <p>Update: Slikey has posted a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2011116452321927491">fresh tweet</a> about Hypixel's efforts to tackle Hytale's teething issues. "We are already working on a patch for bugs and crashes," it reads. "That will hit the pre-release patchline once we have a good chunk of fixes. We are working on any auth issues. Please make sure your time is synced and also saw a report about Norwegian OS language causing issues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">went live a short time ago</a> as I write this. While plenty of folks look to have gotten in already, its devs have issued some guidance for the many others who've reported running into error messages or having their downloads stick.</p>
<p>The team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme who've swiftly resurrected the Minecraft-esque sandbox after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights from Riot Games</a> had predicted launch day might see some teething troubles due to a bottleneck of eager Hytalers, and it certainly seems those concerns weren't misplaced.</p>

<p>While some of the errors folks have run into early doors trying to get into Hytale have been at the point of purchase - here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-error-a-basket-with-that-identifier-does-not-exist-fix">handy guide on how to deal with at least one of those</a> - a bunch of reported having things go pear-shaped while trying to download the game via its launcher.</p><p>Cue a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/523059903812599811/551337246364532737">Discord server</a> full of people spamming error messages. So far the Hypixel team are working on fixes, but the main bit of advice at this early stage is simple. "If you are seeing launcher downloads being stuck / error. Please restart the launcher," Hytale tech director Slikey has posted. "Global distribution is still rolling, so you may need to keep trying."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you are seeing really weird stuff, please reply to me.</p>— Slikey (@slikey) <a href="https://twitter.com/slikey/status/2011095876270203181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Meanwhile, folks with "really weird stuff " are being encouraged to reply to his tweet. While Hytale's Discord server doesn't appear to have a dedicated channel for those seeking help solving issues or getting advice on fixing bugs, its general game discussion channel has seen a bunch of posting to that effect in the past hour or so.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you're able, I'd give it an hour or two to settle down before trying to hop in if you're keen not to spend time having tech doors potentially slam in your face. Maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-doom-running-in-hytale-before-its-even-out-thanks-to-modders">watch a modder play Doom in Hytale</a> on repeat if that helps. We also have a guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">installing the latter on the Steam Deck</a> if you need such a thing.</p>
