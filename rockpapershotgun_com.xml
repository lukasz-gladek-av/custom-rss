            <p>
I never played enough of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> to be seriously annoyed by its infamous level scaling system, but I gather from the anguished recollections of colleagues that it was like having a fistfight with a mirror. You'd pour all that blood and sweat into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s obtuse skill-massaging systems, and the simulation would toughen up in response, with hitherto modest bandits showing up garbed in armour and items that matched your capabilities. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's probably a life lesson in this. Something about, you know, not trying. Something about accepting that "progression" is a joke, that all our of feats are dust in Creation's compound eye, that we neither deserve nor are capable of change. Oh wait, hang on, the level scaling was a massive error of judgement! So sayeth original Oblivion designer Bruce Nesmith, speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-levelling-system-mistake-admits-designer-haunts-remaster/">Videogamer</a>, which invites the question: why haven't they gotten rid of it for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>?
</p>
<p>
As Nesmith notes in the interview, the Remastered version's creators have made some significant adjustments to how you gain levels. Instead of improving major skills and then sleeping to boost your attributes, depending on said major skills, the new version of the RPG doles out XP per skill-up and lets you pick which attributes to improve.
</p>
<p>
"They actually went ahead and changed the game design underneath... some of the systems design," Nesmith commented. "That's pretty much unheard of in a remaster because the whole idea is that they want that old experience, so I consider that to be a very brave thing and probably help the Oblivion remaster to be significantly more popular - assuming they have done what they said and bring it to a more modern understanding of things, that's going to make the game more playable for modern sensibilities". 
</p>
<p>
So why is level scaling still in then? Today's kids are going to hate it, Bethesda, because they are, after all, kids. They still harbour the hope that they will someday amount to something, that there will be a measurable distance between what they are and how they began. 
</p>
<p>
Nesmith is as confused and horrified as you are, reader. "I had a very substantial hand and voice in both levelling systems," he told the site. "The nuts and bolts work, the mathematical mechanics, that was my work and I'm intimately familiar with how both of those things work."
</p>
<p>
"I think the world levelling with you was a mistake and that's proven out by the fact it did not happen the same way in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>," he went on. "That we came up with a much, much better way to continue to provide the player challenge without making it feel like 'oh, it doesn't matter that I went up in levels, the dungeon went up in levels with me"."
</p>
<p>
Are you an Oblivion survivor? I'm interested to read your doubtless seasoned thoughts about whether the level scaling system could be salvaged or improved somehow, rather than simply removed. I don't know whether it's been rejigged at all for the remaster - we've got somebody working on a longer assessment - but modders have already stepped in and stripped the fittings. Take this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">Unlevelled Item Rewards mod</a> from trainwiz, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> homage <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/underspace">Underspace</a> and also, the person largely responsible for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-the-scariest-skyrim-mod-ive-ever-seen">Skyrim's plague of Really Useful Engines</a>.

            <p>Nvidia have released the latest in an unusually frequent series of GeForce driver hotfixes, with the vast majority of identified issues affecting the newest RTX 50 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> specifically. <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">GeForce Hotfix Display Driver version 576.26</a> targets various crashing and flickering problems with, among others, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> – though it’s the growing regularity of these patch jobs that’s more disquieting than any particular instance of game breakage.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While driver hotfixes have been rare during previous GeForce generations, a recent flurry has seen them averaging about one every two weeks, from the 572.24 hotfix for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> startup crash on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> to the black screen scourge of 572.75, and now both the 576.15 and bumper-size 576.26 versions being deployed within the same day. Peering through their patch notes reveals that by far the most common thread is the RTX 50 series, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of their software stability.</p>
<p>I should say that I haven’t experienced any such problems myself while reviewing these cards, which performance-wise, range from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">pretty decent</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">enormously disappointing</a>. Still, I am but one hardware editor, and even the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/564309/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57626-released-42/">Nvidia forum post</a> announcing the latest hotfix leads into a raft of community replies reporting various continuing problems. Driver version 576.02, the most recent stable driver, is repeatedly identified as a breaking point, and with two hotfixes having now been sticky-plastered on top of it, the accusation carries some weight.</p>
<p>It's true that 'stable' drivers are faced with potentially meddlesome time restraints, as they’re usually released in support of either key new games or a new piece of hardware (the RTX 5060 Ti, in 576.02’s case). Still, that’s been the case with GeForce drivers for donkeys’ ages, so can’t really shoulder the blame for the sudden uptick in problems and resultant hotfixes. In any case, if you’ve been having hiccups with your own GeForce GPU, <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5652">give version 576.26 a download</a> and hope you won’t need another one for a while. It’ll need to be a manual installation, as hotfixes aren’t released through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-nvidia-app-is-out-now-justly-banishing-geforce-experience-to-history">Nvidia App</a> like stable drivers are.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Classic RPG remasters</a> drop from the shadows, surprise GOTY contenders <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">spring from the cracks</a>, but life goes on in the sleepy oxen-powered villages of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> from Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse. Well, not entirely.</p>
<p>Change is afoot in oxen country, as detailed in a round-up of update plans for the game’s first birthday. What did you get for your first birthday? I think I got: the continued affection and/or tolerance of my parents, after a year of being puked and widdled on. Manor Lords is getting: an upkeep system, various visual or UI rejigs, and a boost for the AI’s capabilities that ranges from non-player town-planning to the navigation of fortresses.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded by Grzegorz "Greg" Styczeń, Slavic Magic have grown since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publisher-reassures-players-struggling-to-buy-at-launch-that-well-run-those-25-discounts-often">the absurd success of the early access release</a>. “Since launch we’ve welcomed Nathan (map design), Tom and Kurtis from Flix Interactive (programming), Niklas (AI), Basia (2D art), Nicolas (3D art), and Darren and James (game design). We’re also still working with QLOC for QA needs — and more folks are helping behind the scenes, such as Daniel,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/573753783490708647?l=english">a merry Steam post</a>, before unleashing a horde of suheadings that “is not a full changelog or final list”, but “should give you a good idea of where development is headed.”  
</p>
<p>
Let’s get stuck in, then. As regards new buildings, they’re working on a quarry for “endless” stone mining on rich deposits, and a lime kiln that will be required for advanced construction. Planned visual changes include revamps for the UI and map resource nodes, and some overhauled castle pieces. But the juiciest bits appear to involve the AI, which can now build and run a small village, making use of concepts such as burgage plots, backyard and living space extensions that didn’t exist in the early access launch version. 
</p>
<p>
“A lot of work was done to make sure the AI could use the plot tool properly,” the devs add. “We're still working on improving its city planning skills and will soon start working on its trading capabilities and farming.” Letting the AI build villages has also obliged a new approach to the game’s marketplace, though the Steam post doesn’t go into detail.
</p>
<p>
The devs are also making changes to the Record View, with a new screen for regional production and consumption. They’ve tweaked the approval system so that recent events have more impact than older events. And they’re working on a contentious-sounding upkeep system, “which means a smithy will need a constant flow of tools, and deep mines need a flow of planks”. It’s terrible to see the concept of “flow” invading the hitherto stolid pasture lands of the Middle Ages, but I do find the thought of planks cascading down a mineshaft sort of poetic.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the theme of flow, there’s a nice bit in the post that breaks down the appetisingly maddening challenge of having units pathfind through castles that have several floors. “The whole world in Manor Lords was always coded in 2D, which made collisions simpler to resolve and made the game more optimized,” Slavic Magic explain. “However, this meant we can't have "proper" gates where people stand on top and walk below at the same time (they'd collide with each other). 
</p>
<p>
“I decided to investigate this and rewrite the pathfinding to support multiple floors," the post goes on. "However, it's still being tested whether the extra computation cost is actually worth it (it's literally only for the gates, which in theory can be cheated by garrisoning in and out from the gatehouse doors).” Read the rest for a not very medieval, but undeniably cool development gif of militant rice grains struggling to escape a spiderweb of waypoints. 
</p>
<p>
Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">liked the original early access version of Manor Lords</a>, to the point that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">interviewed the composers</a> and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">stalked a cow for clicks</a>. Slavic Magic had planned to keep the game in early access for “around a year”, but it sounds like 1.0 is a ways off.

            <p>The Russian government has threatened to seize the assets of studios behind free-to-play tank battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World Of Tanks</a>, according to state media. Russia has accused the game companies' executives of "extremist activities" in relation to the war in Ukraine, although they provide no evidence in the legal action. The seizure casts a grim shadow over both Wargaming (the original developers of the game) and Lesta Games, a Moscow-based studio who were once owned by Wargaming and who took over the free-to-play game in Russian territories. It's Lesta Games who seem to be taking the brunt of the government hostility.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The assets of Lesta Games were subject to a "statement of claim" by Tagansky District Court of Moscow on April 17th, reports <a href="https://ria.ru/20250426/genprokuratura-2013563207.html">Russian media site RIA</a> (translated by Google). The prosecutor general names Lesta's executive Malik Khatazhaev as the target of the seizures, but also the owner of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly. Lesta have filed a complaint in return to challenge the decision.</p>
<p>"The company is working in full compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus," said the developer in a Telegram group, as <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/04/2025/680a30609a794772af778315">reported by RBC</a>. "So we have no grounds for any fears or concealment of information. We have not violated anything and we have nothing to fear."</p>
<p>To clear up any confusion, Wargaming are the original creators of the tank game - a studio that began life in Belarus but later grew to have studios across Europe, eventually heavily relocating their work to Cyprus. They bought the Russia-based studio Lesta Games in 2011. </p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2022. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Wargaming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-tanks-studio-fires-creative-director-who-voiced-support-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">fired a creative director</a> who supported Russia's aggression and later announced they were<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wargaming-are-closing-their-studios-in-belarus-and-russia"> cutting ties with their Russian and Belarussian studios</a> and would no longer do business there. World Of Tanks was still playable in those regions, though, and became managed by Lesta Games, who once again became a legally independent business. </p>
<p>None of that distancing and repositioning seems to convince the Russian government, however. CEO of Wargaming, Viktor Kisly remains named by the prosecutor general as part of an "association carrying out extremist activities" and is therefore a target of asset seizure. The prosecutor's claim attached headlines from the media reporting World Of Tanks events that showed support for Ukraine by raising money for ambulances (you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF43c5rpCE">a trailer for that event here</a>).</p>
<p>"Wargaming made a strategic exit from the Russian and Belarusian markets three years ago," said Wargaming in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/russia-moves-to-seize-world-of-tanks-developer-over-ukraine-support/">a response to VGC</a>. "The company disposed of its business in Russia and Belarus to the local management at zero cost and on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with no consideration to take it back. Wargaming doesn’t have any assets or business interests in Russia and Belarus."  </p>
<p>This isn't the first time Wargaming have been directly targeted by the Russian state for its sympathetic response to Ukraine. The company's chief business development officer was added to the country's terrorist watch list in 2023, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/belarusian-kgb-adds-world-of-tanks-studio-boss-to-terrorist-list/">PC Gamer report</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A few years ago I found an old hardback tome of Solitaire rulesets on a garden wall. It was a bright, unambiguously pleasant day and I remember thinking 'oh, that's the wotsit that inspired those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-genteel-verdict-regency-solitaire">regency thingamajigs</a>'. So I took it home and tried my hand at a few variations, then forgot about the book entirely. After reading about Occlude, I can only wish my discovery had been more ominous, more foreboding. Why couldn't I have found the book in a secret cellar, its hastily painted-over entrance given away by the motion of air through a dream-catcher? Why couldn't it have been thrust upon me by a desperate man with hypnotic tattoos, pushed into my hands with a precautionary mutter to 'Ware The Onyx Triangle?'</p>
<p>This is the ambience cultivated by Occlude, a "single-player cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> card game for the terminally curious", in which Solitaire is the basis for seven rituals involving Tarot cards, which steadily unlock access to an archive of fragmentary lore. Here's a trailer.<!--more--></p>

<p>I did enjoy my initial experiments with Actual Cardboard Solitaire. I've already forgotten the rules I picked up from that book, but I remember the gentle buzz of unhurried meticulousness, the satisfaction of stacks forming before me, and the sense of fathomless arithmetic at play beneath the table surface. It sounds like Occlude will be a touch more... agitating, partly because it could be an inventory of your character's awful past. </p>
<p>"Have you ever done something you regret?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547010/Occlude/">the Steam page</a> asks. "What if I told you there was a way to fix it? Make it so that something never happened at all; or perhaps, just happened differently. What if I told you it was as simple as a game of solitaire?"</p>
<p>The developers are Tributary Games, creators of political sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-the-castle">King Of The Castle</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-can-scheme-against-you-in-political-sim-king-of-the-castle">Kaan rather liked</a>. Occlude is "smaller and tighter than KOTC, but just as ambitious," the developers add in the announcement post. "It's Solitaire, yes, but much, much more. It's got puzzle mechanics, and a mind-bending narrative that's a puzzle in it's own right. It's a game that is one thing but also another."</p>
<p>I mean, I could say the same thing of my breakfast today - a peanut butter and jam sandwich. But I do respect the desire to take Solitaire and futz around with the workings via hearty injections of, in this case, "Lynchian horror".</p>
