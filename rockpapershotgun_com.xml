            <p>Hello reader who is also a player! Once again I have failed in my fervent efforts to meddle with the Earth's rotation so as to suspend time exactly at 11.30am, Saturday morning. I fear that another week is upon us. Fortunately, it contains some new PC games, spanning full releases and early access launches. Some of those new PC games may even be worth a modest portion of your lifespan and personal capital. Here's a list of the ones I find most appealing or notable.

<li>Let's all go come-of-age in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/consume-me">Consume Me</a> (pictured), a life sim about feeling "stupid, fat, lazy, and ugly in high school", with mostly bad endings</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> does not contain any schools or self-loathing, but it <em>is</em> thinking with portals</li>

</ul>
<p>Aside from the above new PC games, this week will contain a non-zero quantity of games so new they aren't even released yet. We'll hear about a few of them at the latest Tokyo Game Show, which runs 25th-28th September. As I write this I am looking at a spreadsheet of embargoed announcements. The temptation to just paste the whole thing below and take the week off is fierce, but I am absurdly professional and will resist. Pretty sure none of you care about <span tabindex="0">made you look!</span> anyway.</p>
