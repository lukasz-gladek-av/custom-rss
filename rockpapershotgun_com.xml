            <p>Riot's spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> with the terrible name, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, is getting a closed beta in a few months and, to entice fans to sign up, the developers have released a new video showing off pink-haired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> bruiser Vi doing some biffing. I know you like biffing, so I'm telling you about this despite being unable to reliably write the title of this free-to-play wrecker without carefully typing it out like my mum composing an email with a single forefinger. </p>

<p>"2XKO’s Closed Beta starts September 9, available globally on PC," said Riot in <a href="https://x.com/Play2XKO/status/1947686336020025842">a press release on social media</a>. "After Closed Beta begins, our goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance. This is a huge step for us. We’ll be deploying our backend systems at a larger scale for the first time, so things might be bumpy at first, but we’ll improve as we go."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/">sign up here</a> if you are eager to batter Vi for all her baffling choices in Arcane's disappointingly disjointed second season. The beta will only happen on PC, so feel free to be a smug wretch to your long-suffering Xbox friends, although Riot do say that any progression made on PC will cross over to console if you decide to play on multiple platforms.</p>

<p>2KXO was-- excuse me, I mean 2OXK was - sorry, 2XOK was... FUCK. The fighting game formerly known as Project L was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-confirm-fighting-game-in-development">revealed during the EVO fighting game championship in 2019</a>, even though rumours and leaks outed the game not too long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rising-thunder-cancelled">Riot bought Rising Thunder developer Radiant Entertainment</a> way back in 2016. The game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">given its untypeable moniker</a> last year, on the logic that it is a tag-team fighter in which you field 2x brawlers, and that those 2x brawlers will presumably KO somebody. 2... X... K... O, see? </p>
<p>I know. I hate it too. But if you're legitimately interested in the game's ins and outs, Riot have <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/whats-new-in-alpha-lab-2/">an admittedly thorough breakdown of a previous alpha</a> which shows various features, including how the tag team assists will work, as well as clues to how battle-passy things will get when it comes to unlocking cosmetics. This is something that will be interesting to witness, because cosmetics in a fighting game need to be interesting without obscuring or distracting from the clarity of the action. Will I be able to dress up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dressing-up-as-santa-in-tekken-7-and-visiting-players">a cleanly defined Santa</a>, for example? Only time will tell.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new report delves into the behind-the-scenes chaos caused at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a> studio ZeniMax by Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month. Staff say the manner in which the corp let go of around 9k staff was "inhumane" and has left those who remain facing an incredibly tough future.</p>
<p>An unannounced MMO in development at ZeniMax, codenamed Project Blackbird, was one of the games cancelled by Microsoft as part of the corporate bloodletting, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">being canned</a>. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">last week</a>, the ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU) union said they're still fighting on behalf of workers at the studio left in limbo by Blackbird's cancellation.</p>

<p>The staff <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a> spoke to for the report paint a horrifying picture of the day that saw Microsoft jettison all of those people and projects. They claim staff were removed from company communications such as Slack and email before human resources had even made contact to inform them whether they'd been let go. "It was so sad seeing people so distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day - or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day," said current ZeniMax worker and ZeniMax Workers United - CWA union member Page Branson.</p>
<p>"It's not okay. It wasn't normal," added ZeniMax senior QA tester and fellow ZeniMax Workers United member Autumn Mitchell. "I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal — it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way - it's not."</p>
<p>"Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting," the QA tester continued.</p>
<p>Both Branson and Mitchell believe the cuts at ZeniMax, which Game Developer report have affected "hundreds" of workers, would have been worse if a significant number of the studio's staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">hadn't unionised</a>. As is, they say the layoffs have seen key developers be let go, leaving those who remain facing a bleak future.</p>
<p>"A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight," Branson said. "Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly."</p>
<p>"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," Mitchell added, later likening the situation to having to keep on working while "looking at a graveyard".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains]]></content:encoded>
