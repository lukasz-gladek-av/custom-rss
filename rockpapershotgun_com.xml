            <p>I hope you like warlocks. Well, if you're someone who regularly delves into Diablo, I hope you at the very least don't detest warlocks with all of your hellish heart. Because yesterday evening's Diablo 30th anniversary shindig was rather heavy on warlocks, with the class coming to not just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s next expansion, but also Diablo 2 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>. Meanwhile, Diablo 2: Resurrected has moseyed on over to Steam.</p>

<p>Blizzard whipped out these reveals over the course of nearly 40 minutes, during which phrases like "abducting people to drink in the anguish of an entire world" were said. Kicking off with the Diablo 4, the Lord of Hatred expansion set to arrive on April 28th will include a new warlock class that the devs are painting as the final stage in an evolution of the magic wielder's abilities across the other entries in the series it's also being added into.</p>
<p>"In Diablo 2: Resurrected, they hone their earliest arcane powers," explained associate game director Zaven Haroutunian. "Then, in Diablo Immortal, their journey takes a rebellious turn, embracing darker forces and forging their own path. Now, in Diablo 4, the Warlock stands at the height of their strength, fully unleashed and ready to shape the fate of Sanctuary.</p><p>"This class is all about turning the wrath of Hell against itself, with metal chains, flames, and utter destruction," he continued. "The Diablo 4 warlock is like a heavy metal album cover come to life, fighting fire with fire." Blizzard also indicated the contrast between these Metallica-loving mages and the expansion's new Paladin class are key to its story, which is all about Mephisto doing shadow-elongating stuff.</p>
<p>The addition of warlocks to Diablo 2 comes as part of a second expansion for it that's arriving after a 25 year wait. Dubbed Reign of the Warlock, the DLC boasts "an overhauled endgame, fresh mechanics, and modern quality-of-life updates" in addition to the titular new class. It's also packaged by default with the infernal edition of Diablo 2: Resurrected Blizzard have just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536520/Diablo_II_Resurrected__Infernal_Edition/">ported to Steam</a>, with it previously having lived on Battle.net since release in 2021.</p>
<p>That said, a Battle.net account and the Battle.net desktop app remain requirements to play the Steam version of Resurrected, because life can't all be sunshine and publisher-specific launcher free rainbows.</p>
<p>If you've not Diablled in a while, here are some of Alice B's (RPS in peace) thoughts on both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-review">Diabbler 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-new-thing-in-diablo-ii-resurrected-is-making-it-look-like-old-diablo-ii">Diabbler 2: Resurrectiabbled</a> around the times they first emerged from the underworld.</p>
