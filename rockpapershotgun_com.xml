            <p>There are a number of official Jumanji video games, but they don't seem very Jumanjish to me. You've got a bunch of nineties-to-noughties minigame compilations, a pachinko adaptation, and a few reportedly dismal games based on the recent Dwayne Johnson movies, also feat. Steve off Infiniminer and Amy Pond from Dr Avenger: Endgame.</p>
<p>Ludogram's just-announced streamerbait co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invokyr">Invokyr</a> seems to be cleaving a lot closer to the 1995 movie, which is itself based on Chris Van Allsburg's book from 1981. The game sees you and up to three others playing a cursed boardgame that transforms the house it's played in.</p><!--more-->
<p>The one immediate complaint I have is that Invokyr's boardgame looks mega simple. Going by the screens, it has you rolling dice to move one piece to the end of a path. Not exactly Twilight Imperium then. Still, there's talk of "special dice", and the cursed boardgame itself is voiced by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> dungeon master Amelia Tyler. It's going to have a certain stage presence, if nothing else. Hopefully it'll do some crafty things with the movie's literal "we have colonialism at home" theme. There's a Van Pelt-adjacent "great white hunter" in the trailer, below.</p>

<p>The transforming house around the room containing the boardgame is a creature of Blue Principled abandon. It's big and mazey enough that you might get lost, claim the developers, and is capable of various generated biomes - "jungle, ice mountain, oversized toy chest". You'll have to worry about traps and also, creatures such as carnivorous plants and puppets in cages, each with a different mode of stalking. Sort of looks like they hunt the same way in the video, admittedly: sneaky-sneak, peekaboo, chomp!</p>
<p>I'd like this to have the variety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s menagerie, in which some anomalies can only be thwarted by failing to notice them. A Lethal Company Jumanji mod would be fabulous, actually. I'd also like it if the board game in Invokyr were a smaller, real-time version of the house, with a very small model of the player looking down at very small boardgame that contains another, even smaller model of the player, etcetera.</p>
<p>At the very least, there needs to be a trap that maroons one player in another world until they have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enH1LsxIJI4">a beard bushy enough to sleep in</a>. It's out... in the future. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3883570/Invokyr/">Steam</a>. Favourite cursed boardgames, anybody?
