            <p>Is that you, RPS readership? It's me, Edwin. I'm back from last week's unscheduled spell of Maw mastication, and regrettably, I still have possession of all my typing fingers. James was kind enough to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">do the round-up post in my absence</a>, but the experience has clearly taken a toll, as he is now in India. James, if I fled to another country everytime the Maw ate a colleague I'd have run out of other countries to flee to. But hey, knock yourself out. It's not like there are any big brands getting fresh instalments this week. It's not like... oh good gravy.

<h2>Monday 20th October
</h2>
<p>All maw-wranglers to battlestations! Here comes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1560160/ILA_A_Frosty_Glide/">ILA: A Frosty Glide</a>, a teeny open world affair featuring a young witch-in-training. Don't be fooled by Ila's apple-cheeked smile and carefree broom-surfing. She's just trying to distract you from the horrors descending from behind.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 21st October
</h2>
<p>Eek, get your katana out of my neck, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>! Can't you see I'm trying to free my ankle from the jaws of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>? Go play Rock Shuriken Shotgun with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Painkiller</a> remake while I check out this neat and relatively non-corpo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2053910/Isopod_A_Webbed_Spinoff/">isopod platformer</a> recommended by Mark. Who's that rattling the doorknob? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>? A likely story. There's no such thing as Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. There are only Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 delay announcements.
</p>
<h2>Wednesday 22nd October</h2>
<p>The onslaught thins! Let's take a minute to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, the Telltale-style superhero workplace comedy, and possibly break the crust on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3882020/Avernum_4_Greed_and_Glory/">Avernum 4: Greed and Glory</a>, the latest CRPG from the genre stalwarts at Spiderweb. There's also internet horror phantasm <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349570/onewayexe_Module_10/">oneway.exe</a>, which was supposed to come out a couple of weeks ago, and bunny-hopping psycho-platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457940/FUNKYHEART/">Funkyheart</a>.
</p>
<h2>Thursday 23rd October
</h2>
<p>I open the window and am promptly blasted across my flat by a jet of water. It must be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2-1">Powerwash Simulator 2</a>. The water covers the lawn outside, which disgorges a wrathful bouquet of rapid-firing daffodils. It must be Popcap remake <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3654560/Plants_vs_Zombies_Replanted/">Plant vs Zombies: Replanted</a>. I flee the building in panic, and am clotheslined at the corner by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012220/Double_Dragon_Revive/">Double Dragon Revive</a>. When I wake, I've been isekaied to the menacing France of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919900/Dreamed_Away/">Dreamed Away</a>, where I sample exactly one minigame before getting flattened by an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880620/Once_Upon_A_KATAMARI/">enormous katamari</a>.
</p>
<h2>Friday 24th October
</h2>
<p>We made it to Friday. Finally, there is time. Time to sit on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bench">The Bench</a> and feed the pigeons. Time to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3905630/Tower_Lords/">build towers</a>, idly. I won't end the week by running off to India like that lily-livered James, but I might pay a quick recuperative visit to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566840/Bleak_Haven/">Bleak Haven</a>. They wouldn't have called it a "haven" if it weren't wholesome. I refuse to look up "bleak" in the dictionary.
</p><p>Do you have your eye on any particular games out this week? If I have embarrassingly neglected to mention a major release, please respect my chronic shortage of self-esteem and give me no sign. With James away, it's just me and Mark cranking the handles of non-guides editorial till Friday, plus evening freelance news from Oisin, so there might be the odd break in postage. Hope things are good at your end.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> might have bagged more headlines, but it's far from the only ambitious modding project being worked on for a Bethesda game with the goal of putting a fresh spin on a classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>: Project Arroyo arguably has an even tougher task, with its team aiming to reimagine the turn-based and isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-2">Fallout 2</a> through Fallout 4's 3D action lens.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDvULKQCbmQ">AVV Gaming</a> that also sheds light on how the team are hoping to incorporate aspects of an original Fallout remake mod that was mothballed last year, Project Arroyo lead Damion Daponte has discussed how they've approached the difficult task of deciding how much to tweak as they reinterpret the 90s RPG.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I would say the hardest part is walking the thin line of not making a completely different game than Fallout 2, but also not keeping it exactly [how it is]," Daponte said in response to being asked about the project's biggest challenges. "Because we could easily just keep it exactly the same, but I will say, especially in this engine, it will be a worse game if we do keep it exactly the same. Even if people don't realise that. I'm sure some people will get angry that we've changed anything. There's really no winning when it comes out. I think most of the changes will be for the better."</p>
<p>As you might expect given the nature of the two games, Daponte outlined that most of the changes the Project Arroyo team are making are related to how Fallout 2's tales and locations are best packaged in a Fallout 4-style game. For example, rather than putting together one big open world space to house everything, as was originally the plan, the modders have opted to break things up into hub worlds that are better at translating Fallout 2's broader geography. So, you won't be able to see San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge from everywhere, but the aim's to have enough custom locations and encounters in and around each hub to give folks their exploration fix.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJlcesILvY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>As for adapting individual missions or levels, Daponte outlined the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>We will block out the area very similarly to how Fallout 2 blocked out the level. However, there will be some minor changes [that] I'll know immediately [to make] with certain areas. For example, the church at the den area in Fallout 2. I wanted more options to enter. If you have a stealth build, I wanted the player to be able to lockpick the door in the back and come in through the back. And then on the inside there's crates and stuff. So, we laid out the crates in a way that the player could sneak in and hide behind the crates and loot them while there's people inside.</blockquote>
<p>In line with that, a lot of the changes stem from accounting for how the player's movement differs, and also elements like adding verticality to Fallout 2's fairly flat isometric sprawls. Presumably, they'll be taking a few cues from how Bethesda themselves reinvented Fallout as a 3D first-person action-RPG with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p><p>It's a challenge that another Fallout 4 modding project, original Fallout remake project Fallout: Vault 13, also faced prior to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-fallout-1-remake-mod-fallout-vault-13-development-suspended">its development being suspended after releasing a demo</a> last year. Those modders were working closely with Project Arroyo's devs, and as such, the latter's team are hoping to incorporate an updated version of the NCR-heavy region around Shady Sands designed for Vault 13 into their creation. Daponte said its inclusion is contingent on how it affects performance, but if it's doable, it'll help speed up work towards an eventual release.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm keen to see what Daponte and co's project looks like whenever it comes out. As the modder acknowledged in this chat, there are plenty of folks who're aware of Fallout 2's contributions to the series' worldbuilding, but that don't get on well with how it plays mechanically. Even for those who do, it'd be another excuse to delve back in and see how Frank Horrigan's doing.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, Clash Royale and various other games and gaming services have been struck down by an "operational issue" with Amazon's web services today, though Amazon themselves promise that they're already seeing "significant signs of recovery". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the provider's <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">bug report dashboard</a>, 62 Amazon services have been "impacted", with some experiencing "increased error rates and latencies". Amazon's down detector says they first started noticing issues in "the US-EAST-1 Region", earlier this morning UK time, but the problem has spread - Amazon provide cloud computing support to a vast number of clients worldwide.</p>
<p>Fortnite players report that they're unable to sign in, with the Epic Games Store refusing to load. Our guides writer Callum has been having trouble getting Roblox to run. The busted cloud functionality has even <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1980194271082000862">taken out the legs</a> from under <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, forcing players to go out and play football using actual feet atrophied by years of computer thralldom.</p>
<p>Amazon's outage has trashed a wider range of non-gaming thingywatsits, including AI tool Perplexity, Snapchat, Airtable, Canva, and even various mechanisms for the ordering of unhealthy takeaway food. *Extremely Emperor Palpatine voice* I'm afraid the McDonalds app will be quite non-operational when your friends arrive. I've also noticed that Slack is running rather stiffly this morning. More's the pity, I will be unable to burden other RPS writers with my requests for edits.</p>
<p>On Reddit, people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obdalz/anybody_else_having_their_alexa_say_sorry_the/">reporting difficulties with the company's Alexa chatbot</a>. Apparently, Amazon-powered doorbells have stopped working in some places. Somebody go rewatch Terminator and remind me whether this is how Skynet got started.</p>
<p>I'll update you as and when the mists clear. In the meantime, maybe stick to playing games offline.</p>

            <p>My understanding of 19th century medicine is roughly equivalent to my ability to describe the smell of the clouds on Jupiter. It's essentially 21st century medicine but minus painkillers and handsoap, right? All the surgeons looked like Clive Owen and were addicted to bath salts. Still, I do recall reading that there was a lot of competition for access to corpses. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>Every Monday, Clive Owen would need to carry out some awful anatomical experiment, like grafting nostrils onto elbows, so he'd hire a ne'er do well, probably played by Andy Serkis, to go rob a grave or three. And if Andy Serkis happened to return with the corpse of a rival grave-robber instead, well, let's not split Burke-and-Hares. 
</p>
<p>New indie game Frankenstein's Monster leverages this sordid energy, while also doing unspeakable things to the legacy of Mary Shelley. It casts you as one of four mad labcoats who are trying to build the best monster out of chunks of cadaver.

<p>There are bodies aplenty out in the surrounding hand-drawn 2D world, which looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> but gloomier, and you can also pinch limbs and organs from the operating tables of your rivals. You start with an already-created monster, approximately drawn from the lexicon of literary monsterage, which you can send to do errands like beating another egghead's face in.
</p><p>One catch is that, you must leave a piece of body for every piece of body, as per that much-quoted line from the Hippocratic Oath, <em>primum non nocere</em> - in English, "a chesticle for a chesticle, a schnozz for a schnozz". So you can't just grab all the giblets. You'll need to be, well, surgical. At the end of each round, a prestigious scientific society will rate your clothing-horse composite of human leftovers. The labcoat who scores highest will gain reputation and unlock abilities for subsequent rounds.
</p>
<p>It sounds fun, and it's out in 2026. Shame it's not out sooner, given that there's a new Guillermo del Toro-led Frankenstein movie in the offing. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4099970/Frankensteins_Monster/">Steam</a>. The developers are Tea Dunk Games, a three-person outfit from London.</p>
