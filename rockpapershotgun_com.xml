            <p>Wizards of the Coast knows the people thirst for more more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>-ish CRPGs, and the company's president has made it clear they still plan on making those kinds of things, even if the D&amp;D action game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-ip-overlord-wizards-of-the-coast-reveal-a-new-dungeons-dragons-single-player-action-adventure">recently announced</a> will be a different kettle of magic frogs</p>
<p>"Don’t get me wrong," said President John Hight when speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/605631/dnd-video-game-giant-skull-wizards-interview">Polygon</a> about the different possibilities making a D&amp;D game offers being a factor in going that route with this latest game, "we are going to do CRPGs that are going to be as serious as BG3."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The WOTC chief was speaking at Summer Game Fest, which mainly focused on the upcoming Dungeons and Dragons action game being developed by Giant Skull, and led by ex-Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. With this action game, says Hight, the focus is more on giving some new folks a chance to see what else they can do with the universe.</p>
<p>Hight and Asmussen are currently keeping their cards close to their chests as to what that'll look like, with the former musing that "sometimes people immediately latch on to, oh, here’s the story we have to do and here are all the features that we want in the game. They start building out broadly without discovering: what’s the underlying thing that’s fun?"</p>
<p>It sounds like that's the stage Asmussen and co are at right now, with the director having concluded that while D&amp;D does come with some of the same canony headaches as Star Wars, there's room within it to do plenty of interesting stuff. Meanwhile, Hight cited Asmussen's work adapting all sorts of mythological beings into God of War 3 as something that should translate to integrating D&amp;D monsters "that form the dreams and the nightmares of people, from gelatinous cubes to owl bears".</p>
<p>Uh oh, how does he know about my dreams of gelatinous cubes gelationously cubing around? Are you  infiltrating minds like a nether brain, mr exec man?</p>
<p>Anyway, as for the actual bones of the game, Asmussen was clear that he's leaning on the single-player action lessons he learned making Star Wars Jedi for this D&amp;D game. There's a lot of chatter about a movement system that doesn't feel janky and Asmussen mentions Hight liking his studio being "experts at melee combat".</p>
<p>It's early days yet, but even if it isn't BG3-ish, here's hoping Giant Skull's game ends up being interesting enough not to just feel like a Star Wars Jedi game wearing a snazzy D&amp;D poncho.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Video game voice actor union <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> say they've reached a "tentative agreement" with a group of games companies that could bring an end to the latest voice actor strike, providing it gets approved by the union's National Board and members.</p>
<p>This tentative deal "puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains," say SAG-AFTRA. That's been the key issue at the heart of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">this strike</a>, with the union citing a desire to push for protections against VAs being replaced or imitated by AI, though it has previously faced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">some criticism</a> for how it's handled striking deals with companies that use AI.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The agreement the union have <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">just announced</a> is with a group of companies which includes Activision Productions, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices Inc, Electronic Arts Productions, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>"Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries," said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, "Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal."</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the union say they expect this tentative deal to bring an end to the voice actor strike that's rumbled on since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">July last year</a>, that work stoppage'll remain in place until it's formally accepted and set in stone. SAG’s National Board and membership will now review the deal. If they give it a thumbs up and a strike suspension agreement is successfully negotiated with the game companies, then things would be set up for the strike to properly conclude.</p>

</span></p><p>GenAI's use in video game voice acting was also at the heart of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">some recent legal action</a> SAG-AFTRA launched against the sweary (at least-pre-patch) Darth Vader chatbot Epic Games, one of the signatories of this deal, added to Fortnite. The Vader bot was made with the blessing of actor James Earl Jones' family, but the union took issue with Llama Productions allegedly having chosen "to replace the work of human performers with AI technology" without notifying SAG-AFTRA or bargaining with it. Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-if-sweary-darth-vader-wasnt-enough-fortnite-developer-epic-will-soon-be-letting-players-create-their-own-ai-powered-npcs">since revealed</a> that they plan to give players tools to create their own AI-powered NPCs.</p>
<p>We'll see how all of this plays out, but in an ideal world, hard-working voice actors will hopefully be able to get back to plying their trade without having to worry about being replaced by AI out of the blue because companies want to save some cash.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
