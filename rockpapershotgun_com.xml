            <p>
It's coming up to a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> received its 1.0 release, and ahead of that anniversary developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/stunlock-studios">Stunlock Studios</a> shared a trailer earlier this week for the game's first big update, Invaders of Oakveil. The update itself will be free (nice!), and introduces a whole new area to explore, the titular Oakveil Woodlands, a woodsy area where "corruption" is spreading (not nice).
</p>

<p>
The big baddie of this update is Megara the Serpent Queen, presumably the source of said corruption. She's got some minions called The Venomblades, which sounds like a great name for a goth rollerblading group. In terms of gameplay additions, there's a new arena-building feature to be found in your castle, alongside one-on-one duels that can be found out in the wild that are consequence free. Oh, there's three new weapon types to mess around with, claws, twinblades, and throwing daggers, as well as seven new spells to boot.

<p>
Combat is also getting a big refresh, with stats seeing a rework, gear receiving some balance changes, and the addition of "new customization tools." Blood types have been reworked too, passive spells are apparently "more impactful", and unlocking spell points gives you some passive bonuses too. Lots of changes!
</p>
<p>
Crafting will be a bit easier too now as you can take ingredients from your vault without having to actually go to your vault to get them. Horse girls will delight in the fact that there'll be stables to store your horses in as well, alongside the ability to fill your prisons with creatures to take blood from (that one's not so much for the horse girls).
</p>
<p>
Alongside a few other changes that you can read about on the game's <a href="https://playvrising.com/oakveil">official website</a>, there's also the fact that V Rising will also be officially supported on Steam Deck. All of this is coming April 28th, so you've only got a couple of weeks to wait.
