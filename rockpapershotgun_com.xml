            <p>
The time is upon us! The time to once again become radical, as from the ashes of developers Radical Entertainment and Hothead Games a sort of but not really new studio has been born: New Radical Games. It does seem like Hothead drew the short straw here name wise. But given that Radical were known for the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prototype">Prototype</a> games, and Hothead made, uh, The Baconing, the choice feels apt.
</p>
<p>
This, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/simpsons-hit-run-and-prototype-studio-radical-entertainment-is-back-as-new-radical-games/">VGC</a>, was revealed not so much with a bang, but more of a snazzy, seemingly new <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">website</a> that is adorned with imagery of the old Radical's games like the aforementioned beloved Simpsons game, alongside references to Prototype and a couple of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> games they made too.
</p>
<p>
Heading up this somewhat new venture as CEO is Ian Wilkinson, one of the original Radical's co-founders, and also the former president of Hothead Games before they shut down in December 2024. Over on Wilkinson's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-wilkinson-28658912/">LinkedIn</a>, it says he's been CEO and president of New Radical Games since the same time period, but with the website seemingly being quite new, it's unclear how long they've actually been around for (a <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/post/welcome-to-new-radical-website">blog post</a> on the site is dated from April 11, 2025, so, it's at least that old). Joining him around the top as COO is Tim Bennison, previously Capcom Vancouver's studio director, but since 2020 also worked at Hothead, also as COO.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what they'll actually be making, well, New Radical Games' website says they can do things like work for hire full game development, co-dev, porting, and remastering. This certainly doesn't sound like they've got anything original in the pipeline, and I truly wouldn't place any bets on anything Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run right now given how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">complicated it sounds like it would be to wrangle even a remake</a>. At least this might explain that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prototype-remaster-speculation-kicks-into-super-gear-after-a-surprise-steam-update-adds-to-its-credits">odd Prototype update from last year</a>?

            <p>
Remember how literally only two weeks ago, PlayStation held one of their "Look at the State of the Place, You've Made Such a Mess!" presentations? There were plenty of announcements that landed with suitable aplomb, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-belmonts-curse-sees-dead-cells-devs-bring-back-vampire-whippage-and-konami-say-its-just-the-start-of-a-revival">new Castlevania</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-first-person-walk-around-a-foggy-scottish-town-in-the-90s-silent-hill-townfall-is-certainly-serious-about-instilling-dread">proper look at Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, and a reveal of remakes of the OG three God of War Games. So it strikes me as perhaps a bit odd, and funny, that today Insomniac Games have, with quite little fanfare, confirmed the release date of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> joint.
</p>
<p>
I'm serious, the studio has literally just released a six second video across its socials which literally just shows the date for four of those. Oh, it's September 15th, this year, sorry, forgot that's the important bits, though for us in PC land this means next to nothing as the game will be a PS5 exclusive at launch. But given that all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games eventually made their way to PC, we probably safely assume Wolverine will do much the same.

<p>
In terms of when that might be, well, I can make a guess. The first Spider-Man game came out before Sony started their PC porting strategy, but for the second smaller entry, Miles Morales, it took two years to make the jump, and for the full-on sequel the wait was about a year and a half.
</p><p>
It is worth considering the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is getting a PC release next month, less than a year after its PS5 launch, but Kojima Productions aren't owned by Sony like Insomniac are, so that might make a difference. All of this is to say, we should expect to wait at least roughly a year, if not a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Since its announcement, we honestly haven't seen all that much of the action game in, well, action, apart from a short gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-wolverine-at-long-last-gets-a-borderline-uncomfortably-bloody-gameplay-trailer-and-a-ps5-release-window">shown last year</a>. I expect it'll be a good few months before we see anything lengthier, perhaps in a summer showcase, but hey ho, marketing has to do its thing! And I'm sure it'll continue to do its thing when it's our turn to play.
