            <p>Video game voice-actor union <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> are launching a legal case against the presence of generated AI voice-acting for Darth Vader in Epic's battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. They're accusing the company's subsidiary Llama Productions of using AI to "replace the work of human performers" - or at least, of replacing human performers without first haggling out terms with the union.</p><!--more-->
<p>The AI-voiced Vader character was added to Fortnite last week, in collaboration with the family of James Earl Jones, the original voice of Darth. Track down and recruit him and you'll be able to take turns generatively bantering with Fauxnakin. Needless to say, the addition has proven a hit among the furiously masticating hamsters of social media. Also needless to say, players have swiftly worked out how to bait DAIrth VAIder into <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">dropping F-bombs 
and slurs</a>, though at the time of publication, Epic appear to have addressed this in a patch.</p>
<p>Now, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have filed <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">an unfair labour practice charge</a> against SkAIwalker Senior with the US National Labor Relations Board.</p>
<p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles," the union wrote in a statement. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.</p>
<p>"Fortnite's signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with A.I. technology," it continues. "Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms. As such, we have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB against Llama Productions."</p>
<p>The court document itself claims that Llama Productions have "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite".</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA - who represent a spectrum of workers across the media and entertainment sphere - have often gone to bat with the video games industry over the usage of human voice-acting to "train" bots, and the potential replacing of voice-acting in games with genAI. Following a lengthy negotiation over AI protections with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher Take-Two and Call Of Duty household Activision, they called a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">strike last July</a> in the name of "fair compensation and the right of informed consent". The strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">continues</a>. Some video game voice and performance artists have, however, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">criticised</a> SAG-AFTRA for striking deals with individual genAI companies.</p>
<p>All this forms part of the wider, on-going debate about the ethics and legalities of generative AI - our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares</a> essay series remains a good primer. While voice actors contest the loss of work, other organisations are picking fights with the genAI biz over copyright infringement.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite?lang=en-US">an Epic Games blog post</a>, the Darth Vader chatbot in Fortnite makes use of two AI models - Google's Gemini and ElevenLabs' Flash. Gemini was recently hit by a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/business/google-hit-with-271m-fine-over-gemini-ai-tool-copyright-breach/">$271 million fine over copyright breach</a>, with France's competition watchdog accusing the search engine company of "training" the bot with material from publishers and news agencies without notifying them. Google have pledged not to contest these facts as part of settlement proceedings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After many months of dogged campaigning in the face of zealotry, atrocity and propaganda about fake WMDs, the heroic avatars of the Illuminate have finally invaded Super-Earth. In just a few short days, the humans and their fanatical and clownish "Helldiver" enforcers may be wiped from the face of the galaxy, ushering in a brave new era in which the surviving bots, bugs and squids link clamps, mandibles and tentacles and dance around singing. You ever hear an Illuminate sing? Literally mind-blowing.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Heart Of Democracy update is upon us, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-enemy-squids-are-headed-to-super-earth-so-now-you-can-tinker-with-your-guns-more">teasers earlier this month</a>. It lets the game's sordid playerbase of perfidious human stormtroopers blow the shit out of some ace nano-tech molluscs on the streets of planet Earth. The new Earth maps are also full of NPC human soldiers who can be left to fight for themselves or enlisted as cannon fodder. There are crowds of panicking civilians, too. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/20/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-live-brings-the-fight-to-the-streets-of-super-earth/">PlayStation blog post</a> announcing the update's release suggests that you'll be "punished" for accidentally shooting them, but that's not the impression given by the below orgiastic trailer.

"Last week, we released a powerful primary weapon customization system and expanded surplus options to fight against the Illuminate as they emerged from the singularity," adds the PlayStation blog. "Now that you have learned the tactics of these new squid troops - like the Crescent Overseer and the hulking Fleshmob - you must master these tools to continue the fight on Super Earth. Use every available resource, divers, and decimate their forces!"
</p>
<p>
Those newly customisable primary weapons aren't the beefiest bullet-throwers you'll find on Super Earth's streets. There are planetary defence cannons that must be woken from their slumber and turned against the majestic Illuminate fleets, lest they succeed in bringing about a future in which the brutality and idiocy of the human race is just a bedtime story for wide-eyed space plankton.</p>
<p>Let the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> enjoy turning their own cities into battlezones, I say. Let the strutting caped vermin relish the spectacle of their own ruination. As for us squid sympathisers in the shadows, let's all cross our tentacles and pray that the flag-fellating bipeds are unambiguously vanquished. Framing jokes aside, it would free Arrowhead up to work on their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-are-great-says-arrowheads-ceo-but-whatever-the-helldivers-2-devs-are-making-next-its-fully-self-funded">unannounced new game</a>.

            <p>"What if Resident Evil and Frogger had a boomer shooter baby?," teases the trailer blurb for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frog-legs">Frog Legs</a>. Stop, stop. You had me at Frog. Then you had me again when I saw the frog using a super shotgun, and then once again when they used a BFG. Then, inconceivably, you had me twice more reading the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1734110/Frog_Legs/">Steam page</a>.

<p>"I think they could have done more with the ribbit and tear pun," said Edwin, preventing me from using any other puns - the game had already been won. Then he told me that it wasn't his pun, it was in the press release. Too late, Edwin. I'd already assumed you were trying to pass it off as your own, and I will now never not imagine your RPS Slack posts being typed atop a throne of lies, into a keyboard made of deception, with biomechanical fingers forged from the melted slag of robotronic autobastards. Features ahoy:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Can be completed in a single sitting (30-40min)</li>
<li>Story-driven experience with a little horror, some action, and plenty of humor!</li>
<li>2D Arcade gameplay reminiscent of the classics</li>
<li>3D First-Person puzzles</li>
<li>Retro Boomer Shooter FPS action with a shotgun and BFG (Big Froggin' Gun)!</li>
<li>(Note: This is not a full boomer shooter / FPS game. That is only part of the game.)</li>
<li>An ensemble of characters you'll never frog-get!</li>
<li>Auto-save on each new level for convenience</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Why are frogs so good? Like orcs, they emanate green idiocy. Unlike orcs, it's a benign green idiocy. You could have a cuppa with a frog. You could play squash. You could sing a fireside ballad. I'm not sure if Frog Legs contains these things. But, again: shotgun. It's by Elliot Dahle, whose other works you can find on <a href="https://elliottdahle.itch.io/">Itch here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>About 30 minutes into the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-harvest-shadows">We Harvest Shadows</a> a picture appeared on my wall, just by the farmhouse main entrance. The picture is of a long hallway of nested door frames, with a sealed door at the end. Any mystery it offers is, in theory, cancelled by the tutorials, which briskly informed me that the picture is, essentially, an alarm system. It will change in subtle and less subtle ways when danger is nearby. Still, this blunt advertisement of mechanical purpose does nothing to dispel the artefact's menace. It's right opposite the stairs, so that I can't avoid seeing it every morning unless I walk down the stairs backwards, and if I do that, I'm leaving myself vulnerable to anything else that might be waiting in the front hall or the kitchen to the right. </p><!--more-->

<p>I observe several picture changes during my time with the demo. By day, the tunnel of doors appears inverted, perhaps symbolising the subterranean retreat or Tarot-style reversal of whatever supernatural element it registers. Sometimes the door at the end of the tunnel is slightly ajar. And sometimes, the tunnel of doors is replaced by a glaring Rorschach rictus that is all the worse for the silence of its scream. The first time I saw the face in the picture, I had two thoughts: 1) gosh, it's getting late and I have work tomorrow, better wrap this up, and 2) the tutorial doesn't quite specify whether the picture itself might be the source of danger.</p>
<p>We Harvest Shadows, then: quite good fun. In this first-person blend of survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> and Stardewlike, you play Garrett - name very probably a reference to the psychic resonance of attics - a city worker who has randomly bought an abandoned farm in the boondocks and sealed himself off from society forever. Garrett has a lot of baggage, evidently, which is perhaps why he keeps seeing things in the woods. Still, he's a cheery soul, the kind of affable space cadet who says things like "mad skills, Garrett!" when he assembles a chicken coop.</p>
<p>The game follows a day-night cycle. By day, you complete tasks like picking tomatoes according to a to-do list on right controller bumper. You can sell miscellaneous junk and produce by dropping it on the trailer by the kitchen: the process by which said junk and produce is converted into dollars is left cheerfully unexplained, as is the sorcerous summoning of tools and construction recipes from the brochure on the table by the wall. The inexplicability of these things suggests both a shortage of development resources and a developer who is confident that their creation's atmosphere and themes can overpower a few bare fittings. Or possibly, make use of them. I reckon the confidence is justified, so far.</p>
<p>Everything on the to-do list needs to be completed before Garrett can go to bed, saving the game and ending the day. This promises to be a source of tension later on, because the sun rolls swiftly through the sky, and Garrett really doesn't want to be outside watering vegetables after dark. The game's paranormal entities run a gamut from scuttling mutants to giant, staring faces that remind me a little of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>. There are firearms, but this doesn't feel remotely like a shooter. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559720/We_Harvest_Shadows/">The Steam page</a> cites A24 films, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains Of Edith Finch</a> as influences.</p>
<p>We Harvest Shadows is the work of David Wehle, crafter of charming fox 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/555150/The_First_Tree/">The First Tree</a>. There's no release date yet. If you find the Steam demo tantalising, you might want to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1559720/view/503946642097963130?l=english">check out this blog about "the advanced dynamic horror system"</a>. If you're more enthused by the Appalachian farming elements, you may be reassured to hear that there's an "endless mode" in the works that sandboxes the story and dials back the spooks. I will conclude by saying that I found this sufficiently chilling that I'm glad I don't currently have any pictures hanging up in my flat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There'll also be discounts on a bunch of Warhammer licensed electronic entertainment products. There likely will not be any news on the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC, because Creative Assembly like to keep to their own inscrutable schedule. And, if certain conspiratorial corners of the internet and also <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dawn-of-war-4-linkedin-post/">The Gamer</a> are to be believed, we might also see something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Dawn Of War</a> shaped.</p>
<p>These rumours have bubbled up from LinkedIn; fetid swamplands where drowning souls beg the local alligators for a swift crunchdeath but are instead tortured with bullet pointed posts by self-styled analysts using 500 of their businessiest words to say "game sold well because fun, also no woke, share if agree" (I really need to get off LinkedIn). Specifically, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8">a post by</a> one Dominik Dolenec, whose UK based investment firm Emona Capital includes both Relic and Blackbird Interactive in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Dolenec shared a picture of himself at Nottingham's Warhammer World, thanking Owen Rees - Games Workshop's head of licensing and project lead on multiple Dawn Of War titles. "Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come,” wrote Dolenec. From The Gamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is this post suggesting Dawn of War 4, rather than a Baneblade deconstructing game from Hardspace: Shipbreaker devs Blackbird Interactive? That all comes down to Dolenec’s t-shirt, which appears in the corner of one of his photos. It appears to bear the logo of Relic Entertainment, suggesting that he’s in Nottingham on its behalf. He also confirms that we’re not seeing things in the comments and he is, in fact, emblazoned with Relic’s crest.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there's your grist, rumour millers. Do with it what you will. Me? I don't especially need another Warhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> in my life that doesn't have Skaven in it, and I'm not entirely sure I trust modern Relic to deliver a decent one even if I did. I would play it though of course, yeah. Who do you think I am, someone who hasn't bought every Killteam big box this season despite not having assembled the Vespids from the starter yet?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
