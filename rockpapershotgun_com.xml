            <p>
A new trailer for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> update, The Last of the Druids, was shared earlier this week, showing off all the cool things you can do in it! Which are mostly relegated to turning into animals, but in my eyes that is eternally a cool thing to be able to do, in a game or not. And with that trailer also came a release date for the update.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a week out now, due to be released on December 12th, just in time for the next weekend. As part of the new druid class that comes with the new update, when in human form you can wield "magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world," including summoning volcanoes, getting trees to use their roots to trap enemies, you know, druid stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Then, there's the three forms you can take, that of a wolf, a bear, or a fire-breathing wyvern. Looks pretty neat honestly! Druid also comes with a couple of ascendancy classes, one being the Shaman, who "channels nature’s fury, harnessing rage to empower his spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down meteors, lightning, and ice," and the Oracle, who has "perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines!"
</p><p>
Here's the rub, however: Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release date most likely won't be March 2026 like it was previously planned for. "I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," game director Jonathon Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">Eurogamer</a> in a recent interview, continuing, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."
</p>
<p>
While there was no specific updated timeline shared, Rogers said he "certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027." I'm sure this won't be welcome news to some, but hey ho, this is just how early access is sometimes. Have patience, friend, the 1.0 will come.

            <p>
Imagine a second, alternate version of our world. Everything is the same, on the surface. The sky is blue, the economy is in shambles; it's the unnatural order of things. And yet, you cannot help but feel something is different. Like there's something missing, or perhaps replaced. Ah, there it is - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</a> is not a game that even remotely exists. As it turns out, this world, our world, where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 does, or rather will, exist, is only the world we exist in thanks to the flip of a coin.
</p>
<p>
This, I would like to be clear, is not a joke. "We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'" explained Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/we-ended-up-flipping-a-coin-slay-the-spire-devs-left-it-up-to-pure-chance-whether-theyd-make-a-sequel-or-something-else/">PC Gamer</a> in a recent interview. Apparently this was during Covid, and both Giovannetti and Casey Yano were looking for their next proper project.
</p>
<p>
According to Giovannetti, a Slay the Spire sequel wasn't the only idea they had. "We had different paths we could work on," he explained. "One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on it, and the rest is history."
</p>
<p>
The coin flip itself isn't something Giovannetti witnessed first hand, it was Yano that did it over a Discord call, which the former notes was "maybe questionable," but he still believes he was told "true result. I think Casey would've massively preferred the coin went the other way, because I was always the card game person, and he was the action game person."
</p><p>
There is nothing more joyful, to me, than seeing the creator of a thing engage in an exercise that is so directly tied to the kind of thing that they make. In this case, it is Mega Crit playing with that fickle game called chance, in the hopes that it will work out, that they will, if they're lucky enough, slay the spire. But maybe don't do this if you aren't literally the folks who made Slay the Spire, this isn't a point in history to be taking unnecessary risks.
</p>
<p>
Slay the Spire 2 is currently slated for release on a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-a-secret-thursday-in-march-2026-alternate-acts-teased">secret Thursday</a>" in March 2026, where you'll be able to play it in early access. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">here</a>.

            <p>
I can see it now… in the near future, the review embargo for Suda51's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, and as far as the eye can see the digital realm is scorched with 7/10s. Its maximalist shenanigans, techno-blasting soundtrack, and ridiculous premise puts it in a position where it couldn't possibly be for everyone, even if such a score is actually ideal for such a game, but when has that ever been the case for a Suda51 game? However, as I said, this vision I have is in the near future, because the hyper-violent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
This release date comes as part of an as always over-the-top new trailer, locking it for launching February 11, 2026 (as locked in as any game can be these days). There's a line in said trailer that I think perfectly encapsulates my feelings of everything I've seen of Romeo is a Dead Man so far, from the titular character himself: "Am I supposed to understand what you're talking about?" I pose this question in return to Grasshopper Manufacture, though to be honest I don't particularly need a response.

<p>
There's enough in the trailer that intrigues me enough to pull me towards that February release date; stylish as hell combat with so many particle effects you'll probably start to feel dizzy, bombastic special attacks that transport you to another dimension, a blank, empty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>-as-hell room, a zombie woman for some reason, an unexplained fusion between a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> and a Gundam, it has it all and more.
</p><p>
It's entirely possible that this all ends up being style over substance, the substance in question being the combat more than the story, I don't need the story in a game like this to sing the highest of emotional peaks. I need it to commit to its outlandishness, and deliver on its crunchy melee swings and punchy gunshots. I'll find out if it manages to do that in a couple of months!
