            <p>
Keep your hands at 10 and 2, drivers, as Ironwood Studios has just offered up a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive's</a> first big expansion, Whispers in the Woods. Where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game has a sort of Stalker-but-you're-in-a-car kind of feel, this DLC looks like it's fully leaning into some horror vibes. The first half of the trailer has some real '70s era, found footage horror vibes, which feels laser targeted at my artistic proclivities.
</p>
<p>
It's sounding like a pretty meaty expansion too. According to the DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam page</a>, the full thing runs between 8-12 hours long, with the whole thing fully voiced, complete with new characters and "additional side narrative to discover." I'm quite fond of this ominous line describing the expansion's plot: "They have come to the Zone and left their mark. Travel into the whispering woods of the OEZ - a disturbing vision of the once familiar forests."

<p>
There's new maps and junction types to be found, some fresh parts and cosmetics to kit your car out with designed by this mysterious group, and of course more anomalies and anomaly behaviours. The big addition that's coming with Whispers in the Woods is a new gameplay system called Artifacts. These are mysterious objects that change and affect both you and the world itself, adding a bit of challenge while also being something you'll need to use to not be sent to the scrap heap in the sky.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's more garage stations, route modifiers, garage cosmetics, and a new lot of music from composer Wilbert Roget II - great name by the way.
</p>
<p>
No release date on the expansion, but it is slated to arrive before the end of the year. And the base game is 50% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">Steam</a>, so now seems like a great time to head out for a test drive.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.

            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>
