            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> supported 128 player matches at launch in 2021. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will support 64 player matches, when it launches on 10th October this year. Some mistake here, surely? Battlefield 6 is a sequel to Battlefield 2042, and sequels are supposed to have More. If I have just given voice to your innermost thoughts, then I fear it is time to bamboozle and horrify you with the nightmare-physics of the arcane game design proverb, "sometimes, <em>less</em> is more". 
</p>
<p>
"But how can this be?" you shriek, as the ground crumbles and the walls peel away. Matter cannot increase and decrease simultaneously! A "+1" cannot be a "-1"! You reach for the whiskey bottle in a frenzy, but it is too late to unlearn this awful knowledge. Anyway, stop screaming so I can treat you to another morsel of insight from Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil. I promise this one won't hurt quite as much.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We thought larger player numbers would work - it just didn't catch on," Uchil said to Edge Magazine in recent reflections about Battlefield 2042's higher headcount, as passed along by the magazine's jovial e-buddies at <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-goes-back-to-64-players-per-match-because-2042s-128-person-matches-just-didnt-catch-on-design-director-admits-look-we-try-stuff-sometimes-it-works-sometimes-it-doesnt/">Gamesradar</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's like when a band tries a new sound," Uchil continued. "Because we like it, but then players don't - and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want." I feel "subservient" is perhaps a bit much, Mr Uchil. Please do not encourage your players to think that they're pharaohs. How many pyramids did the pharaohs build, all by themselves? Exactly. 
</p><p>
As digested by GR, Uchil added that "Battlefield players are very vocal" and will "tell you what they want" as regards the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. Definite deer-in-headlight vibes. The devs "all read the Reddit," Uchil added, because it's "the number-one source, and all of us are on there." All of which continues the well-established EA marketing theme of trying to get 2042 haters on-board with Battlefield 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">designed to evoke the better moments of Battlefield 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like thinking about how many players is too much in first-person shooters. The question of player count is obviously part of a larger set of questions about map design and size, mode design, weapon balancing, and so forth. Generally speaking, when I'm pinned down by a bombardment in a Battlefield game, it absolutely feels like there are 127 other players out there, because those artillery impacts are so very loud. 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, I remember playing Resistance 2 on PlayStation 3, which boasted then-mindblowing 60 player headcounts, and finding that the flagship multiplayer mode's objective structure had the effect of making it feel like a bunch of asynchronous deathmatches. We'd pass queues of enemy players hurrying in the other direction and just sort of wave acknowledgement, like passing bus drivers.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) had similar thoughts about Battlefield 2042. He found that it rarely felt like a 128-player game at all. "Iâ€™m not sure I notice the bump in bodies," Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">wrote in his review</a>. "Sure, things are chaotic, but the maps are so vast to make up for it that the pockets of violence remain similar to previous, smaller entries in the series." 
</p><p>
The obvious tentpole game to invoke here is Planetside 2, proudest of the surviving MMO shooters. I had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-after-fortnite-theres-still-something-essential-about-the-mmofps">unravelling PlanetSide 2's accomplishment</a> in January 2024. Amongst other things, I argued that the vast periphery of each emergent battle makes for a surprisingly good walking simulator. But enough of my wittering. How many players do you consider too many players, inasmuch as such things can be interpreted out of context?
