            <p>
All these massive, multi-billion dollar acquisitions are getting a bit scary, aren't they? The one on everyone's minds at the moment is of course Netflix's proposed takeover of movie studio giant Warner Bros, offering up a cool $82.7 billion in exchange. This, of course, has an indescribably massive potential to ruin mainstream cinema, but we won't get into that right this second, because there's another concern: how much the streamer does not seem to care about the games side of Warner Bros.
</p>
<p>
When asked about Warner Bros' games arm in a recent Netflix <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">investors call</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>), and whether the Warner Bros "assets enhance or accelerate the success in the gaming side," co-CEO Gregory Peters said that it does, with a caveat. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," Peters explained.
</p>
<p>
"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros haven't exactly been doing great broadly speaking with games in recent times. Earlier this year they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">outright closed Monolith</a>, developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and Shadow of Mordor, cancelling the studio's Wonder Woman game in the process. Plus there were the flops that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">Suicide Squad</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">MultiVersus</a>.
</p><p>
Netflix haven't exactly smashed it on the games side either, having recently sold Spirit Crossing studio Spry Fox <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">back to its owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laying staff off at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio earlier this year</a>. And there's been no obvious breakout hits that aren't based on previously existing series.
</p>
<p>
This leaves a lot of room for concern over how Netflix may handle all of these new properties. Will it be the games companies Warner Bros own that get hit with the inevitable layoffs that come from massive acquisitions? Will these developers be forced into making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> and Squid Game adaptations, and whatever show trends next, ad infinitum?
</p>
<p>
These questions won't be answered for years yet, let's not forget how long Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard took, not to mention the anti-trust process it went through. Perhaps we should cross our fingers for the individual developers involved, come what may.

            <p>Rockstar Games' firing of more than 30 workers just over a month ago has once again been brought up by UK politicians, with prime minister Keir Starmer calling it a "deeply concerning case" which will be looked into by government ministers. Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The dismissals <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">reportedly followed a discussion</a> on a union-focused Discord server in which staff cited emails from Rockstar about changes to the company's internal Slack policies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to a session in the House of Commons today, December 10th. Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray raised the issue of the firings, saying: "Having met Rockstar [about the firings], they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting." He then asked Starmer if the big cheese agrees that every company has to follow employment law and that workers have the right to unionise.</p>
<p>"It's a deeply concerning case," replied the prime minister. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>

Keir Starmer was just asked about the Rockstar firings in Parliament today where he described the situation as "deeply concerning" and promised it would be looked into by government ministers.

</span></p><p>We'll have to see if anything comes of that looking into things, but it is noteworthy that Murray said he'd come out of meeting with the publisher with reservations as to whether Rockstar's firings were justified. Murray has shared more detail about his meeting with Rockstar in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate">IGN</a>. "The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed," he said.</p><p>"The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," the MP continued. "I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p>
<p>While the IWGB have accused them of union busting, Rockstar have stuck to their line that the staff were let go for "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine has also previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in the House of Commons</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister.</p>
