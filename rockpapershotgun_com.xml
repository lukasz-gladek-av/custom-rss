            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta cheaters were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/water-is-wet-the-sky-is-blue-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-has-cheaters">inevitable and expected</a>, with Activision hinting that they were intentionally prepping their big anti-cheat guns prior to early access kicking off. Now the beta's first weekend's passed, the publishers' anti-cheat enforcers Team Ricochet have posted an update addressing the cheating situation, claiming that their efforts thus far have seen a lot of success.</p>
<p>Seriously, they go as far as openly declaring that cheat sellers are "feeling the heat", which is a massive missed opportunity to use the phrase '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">quaking in their unsecured boots</a>', but we can't have everything.</p>

<p>"You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta," Activision's post read. "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We’re watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt."</p>
<p>Cue the whipping out of some stats which the developers say apply to the beta's opening two days. "97% of cheaters were stopped within 30 minutes of their first sign-in," and "fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes." "And this is just the beginning," Activision wrote. "When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat’s defenses will only grow stronger."</p><div>

<p>They're impressive stats to tout, but they do leave some question marks. Without the full numbers in terms of cheating instances detected and dealt with, it's tough to say how much success this symbolises. There's also the matter of any numbers only taking account instances of cheating Team Ricochet managed to detect, leaving the potential for attempts that may have gone totally undetected to have slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>Activision also went beyond just saying their beta anti-cheat efforts have been successful thus far. "Major cheat providers are now labeling their tools 'unusable' or 'detected'," they wrote further on in the post. "Resellers are acknowledging they have no reliable products to offer for Black Ops 7. We’re not only disabling their cheats, but also their illegal businesses as well. We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> launched. Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement."</p>
<p>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge and we’re committed to leading the charge," they concluded. "We continue to bring new systems online during Beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights." It's fighting talk and we'll have to see whether Black Ops 7's full release brings more hoops for regular players to jump through as has happened with mandatory secure boot.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's beta runs until October 8th, so odds are Activision will be back to share more stats about their anti-cheat efforts across the full duration of early access then.</p>
