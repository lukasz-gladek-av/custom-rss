            <p>
Have you, like me, been unable to get <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joemamagod/video/7541963643601112334?_r=1&amp;_t=ZN-9059pfG1vGw">that one TikTok sound</a> out of your head that mixes Anri's iconic anthem I Can't Stop The Loneliness with the screams of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight's</a> very own Hornet ever since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> came out? It's a surprisingly good combo, but it also serves as an unintended reminder for something: these particular screams of Hornet's are nowhere to be found in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>. You know, the classics, like "SHAW," and "Adino!" not to mention the unforgettable "Hegale!" So of course there's a mod for that.
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, Team Cherry decided to opt for Hornet taking a quieter approach to her attacks and special abilities compared to the boss version of her you fight against in the original Hollow Knight. I can only assume that's because spending upwards of 20 hours getting to just the default ending of the game would surely result in "SHAW" getting a bit grating for some people. That doesn't mean folks haven't been missing these sounds though, and coming in to save the day is modder Nai, who made a mod simply titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/158?tab=description">HK Hornet Voice Restored</a>."
</p>
<p>
As you can probably guess, this mod replaces the sounds she makes using her silks skills with the sounds she emits in Hollow Knight as a boss (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/essential-silksong-mod-rights-team-cherrys-greatest-wrong-by-giving-hornet-her-iconic-hollow-knight-voice-lines-including-and-especially-shaw/">GamesRadar</a>). It's obviously quite a simple mod, though I am quite charmed by it. Sometimes sequels receive such tiny, most inconsequential changes that actually mean a lot or stick out to the people that played the original, so it's always fun to see how people adapt to them.
</p>
<p>
And then sometimes people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">just want to be horny about the bug girl</a>. Go figure!

            <p>
It's been no secret that Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> landed like a piece of haddock at the fishmongers. This shouldn't necessarily be a complete surprise, after all this is their first attempt at a live service game that's all them (they also helped to make CrossfireX, and that didn't go very well either). Still, to Remedy's credit they've also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-still-backing-fbc-firebreak-despite-a-slow-steam-launch-confirming-its-next-major-update-for-september">committed to bring changes to the game</a>, and those changes are coming in the form of a big update titled Breakpoint next week.
</p>
<p>
Moving swiftly along from the fact that this update's name feels like a make or break point for FBC: Firebreak, Breakpoint is set to arrive next week on September 29th. There is some new stuff that's coming with this update, but the main point of it is multiple system overhauls and quality-of-life improvements. I mean, Remedy literally said one of its goals with this update is to "Improve everything about the FBC: Firebreak experience." That's a tall order!
</p>
<p>
One of the big issues with the game is that onboarding just… didn't really work. Many found it a bit difficult to parse, with systems not getting enough explanations. Now, right at the start of the game there's an "Orientation" tutorial level that comes with a voiceover and tips to get you acquainted with the basics. You'll find some new job overview videos to better understand the game's different Crises too.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the Crises, these work a bit differently now too. There's now a Crisis Board, replacing the game's job selection screen, which refreshes every 30 minutes, and you can choose specific Crises to play too. Remedy explains that each Crisis is "currently a curated version of one of the existing five (six with the update) Jobs with randomized rewards, objectives, and length." There's also a new Crisis to play through, based around that mold you might remember from Control. Nasty stuff, but more to do is always good.
</p><p>
The game's economy and progression has been changed too, namely that you keep any gear, guns, or perks you've unlocked. On top of that there are three currencies to be found, and any currency you currently have will be split evenly between these three.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's next, Remedy says the next major update is coming in late November, which they're currently calling "Rogue Protocol." That one will have cross-platform voice chat, as well as a new game mode. After that, the next big update won't be until March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Who knows whether this update will breathe enough life back into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> or not, but at least Remedy is giving it a good go. You can read about all of the changes and additions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">here</a>.

            <p>
Heart Machine have had a busy year. It was only in January that they launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> into early access, a surprise follow-up to their beloved indie action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. That launch didn't go amazingly due to a myriad of reasons, and even now the game hasn't completely managed to find its footing yet. And then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a>, their search action (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">Metroidvania</a>) game that at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
That date is quite soon, too: November 11th, less than two months away. This date came with a new little gameplay overview trailer, showing off some of the tools the game's protagonist will be able to use on her journey. I'm quite into the concept behind them, they're all just things you're likely to find left behind in a ruined city; a computer mouse, an electric guitar, a pair of sunglasses, all usable in combat that's apparently partially inspired by games like Smash Bros.
</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>
The overall concept is a tantalising one too. You play as Luca, a teenage girl caught up in the mess of a quarantined city whose body becomes so damaged she's forced to let a demon named Rhem in to fix it. This city is in ruins because of some experiments conducted by an evil corporation (the evil being a bit moot there because when isn't a corporation evil), with other demons having possessed everyday household objects.
</p><p>
Possessor(s) marks a bit of a departure for Heart Machine having transitioned to a 2D, sidescrolling plane. There's certainly the hallmarks of the studio with its fresh concept and killer art direction, I'm just hoping they've managed to pull off a hit given how Hyper Light Breaker has been put through the ringer. We'll find out in a couple of months!
