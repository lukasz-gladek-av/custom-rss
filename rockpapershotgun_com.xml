Despite many others disagreeing with this stance, I am of the opinion that it's completely fine that we'll likely never get a "classic" 3D Zelda game again. By that I mean, the whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> format is definitely the direction Nintendo will continue to go in, they've just been too popular. However, I understand the desire for such an experience all the same, and I think Demi and the Fractured Dream might be able to scratch that itch.
</p>
<p>
Announced during today's Annapurna Direct, Demi has you playing as, uh, Demi! A "voidsent" born into a world with a cursed fate he's trying to avoid. It's the debut title from Yarn Owl, and honestly, it really does kind of look like they went "hey wanna make a '90s era Zelda game?" That's not a knock against it to be clear, as it's also a nicely stylish and swish looking game.

I often find that games inspired by the 3D Zeldas can look and feel a bit too flat, or uninspired. Demi the game has a real strong vibe going for it, with Demi the character appealing to my own sensibilities quite a lot. I very much vibe with his deer boy vibe, his sword with a handle made from what looks like a tree branch is cool as heck, and yeah, I even like that he literally just has Link's pointy, droopy hat but in blue. Combat looks nice and smooth too, though that's something I'd have to try out for myself at some point to comment on it properly.
</p>
<p>
As of right now it doesn't have a release date, but you can probably already guess that it's coming to PC given that I covered it here.
