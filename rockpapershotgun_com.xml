            <p>The yearly speedrunning superstream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> is starting this weekend, and it's set to be a musical one. The events will include a player who will beat a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear "all romances" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ah, I totally forgot there are <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout:_New_Vegas_sleeping_partners">eight named characters</a> in Bethesda's radioactive wasteland with which you can do the horizontal hip hooray. Including one robot called "Fisto". Well, you can look forward to that on Thursday. The festival of nippy nonsense starts on Sunday 5th and runs until Sunday 12th. A whole week of saxy shennanigans. You can see the full schedule <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">on the Games Done Quick website</a>.</p>
<p>The appearance of Crazy Taxi during the speedrunning fest might be inspired by news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-crazy-taxi-reboot-will-apparently-be-a-triple-a-game">an upcoming reboot</a>. And the musical accompaniment may include some old favourites from the original soundtrack. Long-toothed taxi drivers will remember the Dreamcast and arcade versions had a punk rock OST with lots of Offspring and Bad Religion, but those songs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbla-psn-crazy-taxi-drops-soundtrack">got removed in later editions</a> of the game due to licensing rights. </p>
<p>However! You can see how the band scheduled for Awesome Games Done Quick performs the Offspring track "Way Down The Line" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">this submission video</a>, which they performed alongside a playthrough from a player's previous speedrun. They even change some of the lyrics to jokily reference speedrunning. And I enjoy the way they cut off abruptly every time the game timer runs out and the menu pops up. </p><p>As for the jazzy side of things, you might have already seen the saxophonist "Dr Doot" completing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAhTPRQkHdE">a no-hits run of Elden Ring</a> on his own time. This time he'll face a "controlled" set of bosses. It is very satisfying to hear the brassy doots and swoots as he calmly rolls away from danger.</p>
<p>Some newer games are also on the roster. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake will all see speedruns of various kinds. Some ambitious folks are also planning to nip through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, with the organisers allocating 50 minutes to the retro collection. Does that mean they'll spend one minute on each game? Or maybe they're planning to complete as many games in the compilation as possible? I don't know. But it could be an interesting one. </p>
<p>The Games Done Quick organisers regularly raise <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gdq-founder-steps-down-after-13-years-and-more-than-41-million-raised">millions of dollars for charity</a> in their bi-annual events. This year they're once again supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Last year's Summer Games Done Quick (the beshorted beachy brother of the classic January event) saw a Sekiro player interrupted during a speedrun by that most baffling of Windows interruptions - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-sticky-keys-cant-stop-sekiro-master-and-other-speedrunners-from-raising-25-million-for-summer-games-done-quick">sticky keys</a>. But it didn't stop the shinobi slashing from tipping the event over the $2.5 million mark.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? "Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suffering">The Suffering</a> 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite </a>enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.</p>
<p>Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Season 2 released yesterday alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/515196931452962768">patch 1.2</a>, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.</p>

<p>The new unit is the Raiden, a giant flyer that fires three bolts of lightning at once at different targets. It’s good at fighting medium units. There are also reworks for the Sabertooth (new model, a new tech) and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overlord">Overlord</a>, which is now “larger, stronger, and more expensive”. Death Knell is a new, scarier version of my beloved large laser boy Melting Point, but is only available in the Brawl and Survival modes, which I don’t play. An actual, tangible tactical thought I often have in Mechabellum when considering my formation is "it needs more pew!", so I might have to branch out.</p>

<p>But the star of the show is surely the new specialist, mostly because of how utterly haunted he looks from his years of service in the mechanised forever wars. The Intensive Training Expert gets an extra 50 supplies in the first round, plus a free intensive training upgrade. That’s the one that levels up a unit. In part, Mechabellum is a game of deciding how much time to dedicate catching up and responding to your opponent’s specific chain of cascading power spikes, so I’m interested to see how much this deeply troubled war bastard will affect things.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">my review</a> of Mechabellum, which I slapped a Bestest Best on. Here’s the paragraph I feel sums the game up best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Its truest joys lie in wanton destruction; so unbelievably tactile for a game in which not a single shell casing is spent without minutes between the locked-in trigger pull and muzzle flare’s crescendo. Watching for weak spots, applying the thriftiest dash of pressure without overextending, and watching entire flanks crumble as several rounds of planning pay off - planning that might just have looked like panicked flailing to your opponent. Having the merest snack-sized premonition of a hunch vindicated as you scry the patterns in your foe’s placement, and having already answered their plan with a hearty “not today, fucko” before they’ve even got close to pulling it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fun robots big. Big robots fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
