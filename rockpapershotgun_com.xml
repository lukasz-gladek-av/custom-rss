            <p>Two Ubisoft studios have announced plans to cut back staff, though one of them is trying to encourage people to lay themselves off in the form of "a voluntary career transition program". The studios in question are Ubisoft Massive - creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and Ubisoft Redlynx, creators of the multiplayer gadabout Trials biking games.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Yesterday, a Massive representative posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386779718370422784/">LinkedIn</a> that "[as] part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games.
</p>
<p>"To support this transition responsibly," the post goes on, "we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."
</p>
<p>It's good that people are getting some apparently decent severance in return for realigning themselves into the rubbish bin, but that may not be much consolation for developers weighing the odds of future, involuntary layoffs on less favourable terms. Massive haven't specified how many roles they hope to cut, and at what point they will deem themselves to have been sufficiently "realigned". Quit now for a juicier leaving package, or stick around because you enjoy your job and thereby, increase the odds of being sacked down the road? 
</p><p>Massive haven't had a brilliant couple of years. Last year's Star Wars: Outlaws was much-hyped, as you might expect given that it's an open world game bearing the stamp of Lucas, but it proved to be merely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">"perfectly OK bit of Star War"</a> and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a "softer than expected" launch</a>. Its commercial struggles were a big factor in Ubisoft's decision to delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until they could be sure of doing the right numbers. Massive's current projects include Tom Clancy's The Division 3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced in 2023</a>. We've heard little about it since. The Division 2 was said to be performing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-restructure-as-creative-houses-as-q1-25-26-financials-come-in-lower-than-expected">"strongly"</a> in the company's most recent earnings report, but that's following Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">closure</a> of one of the game's support studios in January.
</p>
<p>All the above doom-mongering notwithstanding, the Massive people potentially affected are definitely in a happier situation than their colleagues at RedLynx. Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">just announced</a> a "restructuring proposal" for the studio, to be thrashed out in collective negotiations with staff. Said negotiations primarily "concern the production and administration teams", and are all in the name of transforming Redlynx "from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens". 
</p>
<p>The post adds that Redlynx have "two unannounced mobile projects" in the offing, in addition to a technology team who work on Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. The proposal aims to trim the books by a maximum of 60 members of staff, and the negotiations are scheduled to run from October 30th till end of November.
</p>
<p>While the chief worry here is how many people will lose their livelihoods, I'm also saddened to hear that Ubisoft want Redlynx to shift away from PC and console, inasmuch as it means RPS will have less opportunity to write about Trials, a wonderfully daft party game.</p><p>It's of course noteworthy that neither Redlynx nor Massive appear to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a>, now called Vantage Studios, which is dedicated to Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six - regarded by Tencent as the juiciest parts of the Ubisoft pineapple. Anything that falls outside that core money-spinning operation appears to be more in danger of "realignment". In July, Ubisoft announced that they would reorganise the rest of their operation into "creative houses", with a view to being more "agile" and "focussed". Best of luck to all the rank-and-file devs mixed up in all this.</p>

            <p>Big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. Seriously, it's massive. Dubbed the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, this behemoth boasts of having attempted to murder more than 200 bugs, alongside delivering some performance optimisation and gun balancing tweaks.</p>
<p>A healthy suite of changes indeed, and one that looks worth the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-need-just-a-smidge-more-time-for-that-next-helldivers-2-patch-promises-a-healthy-suite-of-optimisations">bit of extra wait</a>, assuming it does what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Arrowhead design director Niklas Malmborg and gameplay designer Lennart Holmgren dissect the Unjust: 4.1.0 update over the course of about a half hour in the video above, but we'll delve into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/538868565209514366?l=english">full notes</a>.</p>
<p>"This update focuses on what matters most right now: making Helldivers 2 feel better to play," they read. "We’ve overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us. That means more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most. Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. While new features are coming, this patch marks a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it. More refinements are already underway."</p><p>Outside of the fixes, it's worth reading through the mountain of gun balancing adjustments. Primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems should generally feel more effective, while SMGs and pistols have been specifically targeted with changes aimed at making them great in close-quarters fights, but less viable at long range.</p>
<p>How weapons with differing rates of penetration perform has also been looked into, with light penetration guns having been tweaked to "generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies" in an effort to set them apart from their medium penetration brethren. A bunch of enemies have undergone tweaks aiming to ensure you can effectively splatter them with both those levels of penetration. As part of that, the fearsome Terminid dragon roach has had its spawn rate decreased and can now be taken out by solely targeting its wings, which have been made more vulnerable to explosions and given their own health pool.</p>
<p>That's a quick rundown, but as I say, it's worth reading through the full thing if you're planning on dropping in soon. Here's hoping this effort Arrowhead are now putting into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">stabilising everything before ploughing ahead with more additions</a> pays dividends.</p>

            <p>Paradox have outlined some workarounds for a number of "high priority" issues which have been draining folks' ability to get sucked into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> now the gates to Seattle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cannot-possibly-be-on-sale-now">are open</a>. Proper fixes for these and other known issues are also in the works, as is planning for post-release additions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-thank-you-and-upcoming-plans">blog post</a> which kicks off with a nice thank you, the studio quickly got down to brass tacks. "From your comments, we also know there are some players who are facing issues," they wrote. "While we continue working on the post-release plans for Bloodlines 2, we’d like to address some of those immediately and provide possible workarounds so that as many of you as possible can return to enjoying the game. As part of this process, we want to thank everybody who’s taken the time to fill out the bug report form. It helps us immensely to get an overview of what issues people are facing!"</p>
<p>They proceeded to outline some of the workarounds they've devised for "high priority" issues. Folks who're struggling to get the Bloodlines 2 to launch or are getting stuck on its starting screen are advised to try running it as an admin. Those unable to use their AZERTY keyboard or bind keys as they should might find "adding the QWERTY keyboard layout in Windows" to be a solution. Finally, if your version of Seattle isn't "populating correctly with NPCs" during certain quests, reloading your last save from the main menu's worth a shot.</p>
<p>"We are also working on some platform-specific performance issues, such as crashes on PS5," Paradox added. Regarding known bugs like the Lasombra and Toreador being locked at the clan selection screen on some platforms, we recommend updating and reinstalling the game."</p><p>Finally, they're aware players have indicated they're not happy with things like the the lack of an FOV slider, not being able to turn off bits of the HUD, and underwhelming beard/moustache options. Rounding out that list of gripes is not being able to turn off motion blur, with the studio recommending you "try turning post-processing to low" in that case.</p>
<p>"Your passion, feedback, and patience mean the world to us, and we’re committed to continuing to improve Bloodlines 2," the post concluded. "The story of Seattle’s Kindred is only just beginning."</p>
<p>While the work they're putting in might not revamp things to the extent it's worth substantially re-evaluating whether Bloodlines 2 lives up to its moniker as a sequel to a beloved classic, here's hoping it can poke things from the merely ok territory Dominic Tarason spoke of in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a> towards the unquestionably good realm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">Mods</a> will also likely help achieve that goal.</p>
