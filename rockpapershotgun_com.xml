            <p>Last night, at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a>, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a>, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delivered by snakeskin-jacketed CEO Jensen Huang – interesting optics there – the CES keynote also detailed DLSS 4, an upgraded version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a> and its anti-aliasing/frame generation combo, as well as the input lag-quelling Nvidia Reflex 2. Let’s stick with the new GPUs for a moment, though, not least because I worry that I actually quite fancy the sound of the RTX 5070 and am convinced I’m being mindgamed into it.</p>

<p>Here’s the key specs and the pricing, which with the exception of the RTX 5090, actually stoops lower than each model’s RTX 40 series equivalent. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review">RTX 4080</a>, for instance, launched at £1269 / $1199, while the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review">RTX 4070</a> started from £589 / $599. Only the RTX 5090 and RTX 5070 Ti get VRAM capacity upgrades, though all four are switching to the newer, faster GDDR7.</p>

<p>Given that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">RTX 4090</a> currently struggles with precisely nothing, even the enforced ray tracing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> at 4K, it’s hard to see the RTX 5090 as anything other than a two-grand solution to a problem that never existed. The rest, though? Could be worse, could be worse. It took the RTX 40 series half a generation to fix its affordability mistakes with a new batch of RTX Supers, and these new GPUs are either cheaper or no more expensive. They're all a damn sight less than the RTX 5090, at any rate. Ah, there, see, they did it again.</p><p>Much like how the RTX 40 series got you exclusive usage of DLSS 3, the RTX 50 series also enables DLSS 4, which adds a 'Multi-Frame Generation' feature that can essentially create up to three AI frames for every rendered one. As opposed to DLSS 3, which can just generate up to one extra frame per regular frame. It’s already set for support in 75 games, a decent majority of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">those that currently work with DLSS 3</a>, and its proposed benefits come down to simple maths: more generated frames equals higher framerates, and in turn, better visual smoothness.</p>

<p>This could be a nice touch, though DLSS 4 comes with its own causes for concern. For one, it kind of throws most of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/">Nvidia’s own benchmark results</a> out of whack, with most graphs putting a thumb on the scales by comparing the fully revved-up, DLSS 4 versions of games against older DLSS versions. For what it’s worth, they do include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> results that don’t use any upscaling at all, and the RTX 50 GPUs look to average about 20-25% than their predecessors there. With DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation, it’s more like 100%, including in the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-mode-your-gpu-probably-cant-run">path tracing</a>.</p>
<p>Input lag is another worry, as while DLSS 4 does pour more frames down your eyes, it’ll also mean waiting for those additional AI-generated frames to get out the way before you’ll see another, rendered frame that actually reflects your inputs. Nvidia say this will be addressed, however, by Reflex 2. On top of using the same latency reduction techniques as previous Reflex versions (mainly by having your CPU and GPU work in closer synchronisation), Reflex 2 adds a tool called Frame Warp.</p><p>It works like this: while your graphics card is rendering a frame, the CPU analyses your mouse input to work out where the camera position is going to move to. Reflex 2 then takes the data from the rendered frame and 'warps' the image to use this new, more rapidly calculated camera position, using predictive rendering the fill up any gaps that the additional movement might create. The result should be that what you see on your monitor will better reflect your most recent inputs, potentially cutting input lag by another 50% over standard Reflex.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/reflex-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>Reflex 2 will launch alongside the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 when they release on January 30th, though future updates will add support for older RTX graphics cards. Hopefully more games as well, as only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> and Valorant currently have Reflex 2 'coming soon.'.</p>
<p>I might be the victim of some big dual-fanned psyop, vis a vis the new GPUs, but on balance Reflex 2 is probably my favourite thing to come out of Nvidia’s reveal-athon. It just seems like a good example of using creative rendering techniques and predictive tech to make games feel and function better; I quite like frame generation as a concept and DLSS 4 probably be good for making numbers go up, but a game will still feel like wading through warm tar if only 20 of those hundred-odd frames per second are really being rendered by your PC.</p>
<p>Still, there are worse things to do with generative AI. Like, uh, PUBG Ally, the creepily subservient "Co-Playable Character" built with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia ACE</a> NPC toolkit that lets you bring the Dead Internet theory directly into your battle royales.</p>

            <p>Countless are the pretenders to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>'s skull-buttressed throne, but I sense a certain fearful promise in The Deadly Path, a building management and roguelike strategy game from Owlskip Enterprises. The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The main thing I dislike about the trailer is the tone, which is on the quippy side. This is more a question of taste, mind. I prefer my cosmic horror devoid of whimsy, please and thank you. Yog-Sothoth isn't some kind of menacing party clown for you to throw punchlines at. Mortals are supposed to recoil from such entities weeping and wailing as their minds empty of sanity like punctured fire extinguishers, not cock an eyebrow at the camera and say something like "you don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps!!!!"</p>
<p>A touch of gallows humour can be useful, here and there, but it has to be properly deathly. That man in the trailer sounds like he's having <em>fun</em> being the servant of incomprehensible dark forces. It's atrocious!</p>
<p>Beyond that, I like the cut of these gibbering undead stooges. As you can see from the footage, much hinges on adroit navigation of multiple, competing timers. The end goal in each game appears to be fashioning an idol of some kind, so that your chosen Dread Deity may Ascend.</p><p>The card art is nicely dense with detail, and the lore text is as overripe as you'd expect from a work of Lovecraftage. Consider The Vein of Jealousy, one of the game's festering divinities - "a gargantuan five-headed mass of thrombosed veins that spouts liquid envy as it sees fit, spreading a trail of infectious resentment and bitterness in its wake". Aside from building up a network of minion production and housing facilities, you can advance between ages to "uncover new gods, loot, portals and possibilities."</p>
<p>You might know Owlskip - founded by Tim Sheinman - as the developer behind political satire <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/conspiracy">Conspiracy!</a> and investigative music history game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/family-is-like-a-free-version-of-obra-dinn-but-for-fake-80s-music">Family</a>, which Alice B (RPS in peace) described as "a lovely little gem to spend an afternoon with." Shienman is a dab hand for games in which you sift through and join up documents and memorabilia to various effect. I can see how his skillset would translate naturally to an eldritch strategy experience of this nature.</p>

            <p>The development of 2020 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </a>cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a> (paywalled) in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a> creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.</p><!--more-->
<p>These are 2015’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">Black Ops 3</a> (“over $450 million”), 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Modern Warfare</a> (“over $640 million”), and the aforementioned Cold War. The filing also contained sales figures: Black Ops 3 has sold 43 million copies, Modern Warfare 41 million, and Cold War 30 million. These are specified by Kelly to be "development costs", so presumably don't include marketing, though there's no full breakdown.</p>
<p>There have been higher external estimates for ongoing development of a video game, notably <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/its-taken-4-years-and-roughly-dollar900-million-but-genshin-impact-is-a-better-open-world-rpg-than-ever-after-update-50/">Genshin Impact</a>, but this is by far the highest figure from an internal source. For comparison, Totilo points to court documents from 2023 which revealed $212 and $220 million budgets for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon: Forbidden West</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last Of Us Part 2</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The information, says Game File, is based on a declaration from Kelly filed to a court in California on 23rd December, and is part of Activision’s response to a lawsuit filed against the company last May regarding a 2022 school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The lawsuit against Activision also blames Facebook owner Meta, alleging that the two companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8449dxw23do">“knowingly exposed”</a> the shooter to the weapon he used.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ps5-xbox-series-switch-slump?open=false#%C2%A7item-uvalde-families-sue-activision-saying-call-of-duty-inspired-killer">reported by</a> Game File, Activision last year denied any connection between games and gun violence, while also expressing sympathy for the victims. In October of 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-gun-giant-remington-used-call-of-duty-to-promote-weapons-to-younger-players">previously undisclosed product placement</a> deal between Call Of Duty and rifle manufacturer Remington.</p>
<p>To return to the figures themselves: they’re absurd, yes. It's a shame we don't have a proper breakdown of the costs by development discipline. Is most of the money going toward tuning up the art and graphics? If so, it's worth noting that players nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-66-titles-saw-80-percent-of-all-playtime-in-2023-most-older-games-like-fortnite-or-gta-5">increasingly seem to favour reliable older titles with outdated visuals</a> over expensive spectacle. In any case, budgets this big have worrying implications for individual developers within the Microsoft/Activision empire, who are more likely to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">face layoffs</a> when costs increase and fail to be recouped.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
