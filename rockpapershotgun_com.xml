            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> developers Don't Nod have revealed that they're working on a new narrative game based around a "major IP" in partnership with Netflix. The game'll be developed at Don't Nod's Montreal studio, with the chilling-based streaming service set to publish it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This deal was announced via Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">latest financial results</a>, which detail how they've done in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. CEO Oskar Guilbert characterised the first six months of this year as having seen "solid revenue growth", though the company's total operating revenue of â‚¬13.9 million was down by 5% compared to the first half of 2024. A "performance plan" they've enacted after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs">a rough period</a> - which saw staff laid off, games put on pause, and Guilbert himself accused of "catastrophic management" by the French union STJV - is expected to start paying larger dividends soon.</p>
<p>This deal with Netflix is cited as a "key milestone" in that effort to turn things around. "The project finances the Montreal studio and aligns with the Group's strategy to secure its resources and strengthen its ability to evolve in an increasingly competitive and selective market," Don't Nod say in addition to blowing their own storytelling trumpet.</p>
<p>There's no indication of which Netflix show might be getting the game treatment, but the socials have very much begun to fill with 'Life is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>' jokes. Personally, I think it'll be an adaptation of Victoria Beckham's fashion documentary which also rewinds back Lost Records-style to her and David's heyday in the 90s and early 2000s. Either that or something about a serial killer. Or maybe Wednesday Addams is going to make a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543830/The_Addams_Family_Mansion_Mayhem/">less party-centric</a> return to the gamisphere.</p>
<p>Until we find out, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-bloom-review%3EGraham's%20review">Graham's review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>'s first tape a re-read. It made him ask important questions:</p>
<blockquote>Is it possible that this video game of Young Adult tropes and teenage girl protagonists just isn't meant for me? I have a few rebuttals to that idea. For one, hey, this game also contains the tired 40-something version of those characters, which I obviously find deeply relatable. I was also a kid in the '90s and feel a growing nostalgia for Hey Arnold! and my Nintendo 64. I bet I'd love Yellowjackets, and I own a Rainbow Rowell novel and one day I might even read it, but really I just think that good writing can transcend demographics.</blockquote>
