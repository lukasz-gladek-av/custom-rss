            <p>
There are not enough games in the world where it feels like the initial concept was born from the thought, "wouldn't it be funny if…" I'm no fool, I know this is because developing a video game is akin to getting hit by a car, miraculously coming away from it unscathed, only to be hit by six more cars as you continue your journey. In any case, this is still how I would like to imagine Trust Me, I Nailed It was born, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game where you have to make cool video edits of some warrior to make him seem like a monster slaying legend.
</p>
<p>
This is, through and through, a ridiculous concept, one that aesthetically maybe doesn't mesh entirely well, but I am still clowning with all the same. This is one of those fake OS kind of games a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, with the main bit of faux software you use being World Movie Weaver (i.e., Windows Movie Maker).

<p>
On your timeline, rather than finding the usual video section and audio section, there is an enemy attack pattern section, pre-filled, showing you exactly where an enemy will strike on the grid-based battlefield, and the warrior's attack pattern section, which you are dictating in the edit. You can drag different clips to make the warrior move, perform different types of or block attacks, there's "post-processing" modifiers that let him teleport, or even just take no damage at all. It's movie magic, baby.
</p><p>
Little bits of story are then relayed through emails and posts on MSN (Mana Scroll Network (nice once)), where you can see whether people believe this actually quite cowardly hero is as cool as you've edited him to be or not.
</p>
<p>
The lack of aesthetic meshing I mention is because the hero scenes are all sort of generic fantasy, and the fake OS honestly just looks straight up like Windows 98. I wish there was a stronger sense of identity, what would an operating system look like in a fantasy world? How would technology impact the world, and magic, in kind? This is just a small gripe, though, the concept is fun enough that I won't lose sleep over it. Plus it'll be free! Can't complain about free.
</p>
<p>
It's also due out really soon, as it's currently slated for release next week on February 6th, so in the meantime, you can wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/">here</a>.

            <p>
You know, I'm surprised that EA has never made a Sims reality show where contestants have to act out odd, Simish challenges on a Truman Show-esque production lot, given how much the games themselves feel like simulators for the trashiest (said lovingly) TV show genre. In the meantime, while it isn't at all themed reality shows, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy, seems like a perfect fit for a fictitious one of your own making.
</p>
<p>
A new gameplay trailer showed off how the packs dynasty system works, which is very much about family values. Starting your own dynasty begins with things like choosing your family crest, those aforementioned values, and the family members (or otherwise) you want included. There's also a prestige and unity meter, which can be affected in different ways, like, say, stabbing a mannequin, or getting a promotion because you're a nepo baby.
</p>

<p>
Your Sims also have personal ranks, and lowering the prestige and unity meter may also lower their rank, and another member could challenge your leadership. And then you can just start a new one, so who gives a hoot! There's even some conspiracy nonsense, affairs, scandals to take advantage of, can you see why I think this is ripe for a reality TV show scenario? That'll be up to you to figure out though.
</p><p>
Alongside all of that, there's three new neighborhoods to shape to your will, each of which is already ruled by a pre-established dynasty. Sims can now perform powershifts, which "add fantasy, storybook twists to your royal tale," according to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">blog post</a> about the expansion pack, where they might pull the sword in the stone, or flirt with a fancy frog. Said blog post goes into a lot more detail about what you can expect, so head there for more.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the new expansion pack, as it's currently slated for release on February 12th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <guid>1421821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> just held its 2026 summit this week, and with it came a bevy of details about future updates and plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. Oh what joy for you scaper or runes! The main thing that got a look-in was the game's next big update, Dowdun Reach: Madness of Zamorak, which certainly has an air of someone looking at any section of a given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and thinking "yeah, I want a fortress like that."
</p>
<p>
This update comes following some feedback the devs received over a desire to see more locales with interiors and buildings to fight through and explore, hence the castle keepy nature of this update. There's a bunch of big scary knights to fend off, and in March more details will be shared regarding the kind of loot you'll be able to pick up ahead of its release at the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
What's perhaps a touch funny about this update is that the level cap for all skills will be raised to 99, "even though the skills aren't finished yet." Perhaps an odd choice, but one that's again based on some feedback of folks "wanting to grind out levels and not waste XP." So, if you're someone that likes the grind, technically for now you'll be wasting your time, but any level-locked bits will be automatically available to you as they get added in.
</p>
<p>
After this big update, the next big one is Umbral Sands: Fire of Fuzan, planned for release this summer, which brings you to a deserty area where during the day the sun will be your biggest enemy, requiring you to find shade or build shelter to avoid its rays. There's also a big ole dragon called Fuzan you have to be cautious of, because, well, this game is called Dragonwilds after all.
</p><p>
And lastly, there's Scorned Wilderness: Rage of Kuldra, which is currently planned for launch this autumn. Details are slim on this one, but a <a href="https://dragonwilds.runescape.com/">blog post</a> does have this to say: "What we can tell you is this: Kuldra must die. Face off against the God-Eater and bring down their tyrannical reign as you muster your allies, drive into the wilderness to acquire Rune Armour and delve into the heart of the Anima storm." Why does it always have to be the God-Eater? Can't it be something nicer, less fire-breathy for once?

            <p>
I'm sure there's been many a Dweet and forum post about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is already a dead game or some such silly thing to say about a game that's not even a week old, but it does at least seem like developer Wildlight is paying attention to some of the more constructive bits of criticism about the game. Namely, that many aren't fond of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> 3v3 Raids simply because it feels like there aren't enough people for such large maps. So in turn, there's already an update adding in an experimental new raid mode.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply, as opposed to 3v3 the headcount is upped to 5v5. "We heard the feedback!" reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/538877446766724427">Steam blog post</a>. "For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!" A couple of tweaks have also been made to account for the added numbers, the first being that raids are now 10 lives instead of six, and respawns take a bit longer during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused."
</p>
<p>
With this update also comes a new base called the Soul Well, a "dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak." You should notice some small improvements here and there, for things like animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and "other gameplay systems." On top of all that, you can also turn motion blur on or off now.
</p>
<p>
None of this sounds particularly massive on the offset, but for a game like 5v5 does sound like it should liven things up a bit. We'll just have to wait and see what the results are after this weekend!
