            <p>
Right, has everyone got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> out of their system? I'm sure there's plenty of you that have scoured enough of its map to feel satisfied and ready for another hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>! A game that fits that bill precisely, albeit with its own, quite literally painterly flair, one which is out today.
</p>
<p>
Constance, as you may have gathered from looking at it, is the game's titular hero, one who wields a big ole paintbrush. To say this game is one that takes some cues from Celeste would probably also be apt, as Constance's main foe is, dun-dun-dun, herself. Or, well, her unconscious inner demons, that have imprisoned her within her own mind. These demons appear to manifest in a myriad of ways, such as evil robots, or sentient candles, or straight up bits of paper.
</p>
<p>
Those mental-health focused Celeste inspirations appear to translate to the game's movement puzzles a touch as well, as you do a lot of dashing around avoiding dangerous obstacles and the like. Of course platforming is a big element of many 2D metroidvanias, there's just an element of precise timing here that looks reminiscent of how Celeste functions.
</p>
<p>
I quite like the sound of the narrative framework around upgrades. This is a game about creativity, so you can find "inspirations" along the way to sketch in your journal, which then can improve Constance's abilities. There's just something quite nice, conceptually anyway, about the idea of going out into the world and taking in what it offers you to better yourself in some shape or form.
</p>
<p>
It's cheap as chips too with a 10% launch discount, so as I said, if you're ready for a new metroidvania in your life, Constance is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">ready and waiting for you on Steam</a>.

            <p>Arkane Lyon level designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a> modder Romain Barrilliot is back with another fan creation - a Thief 2 castle heist Barrilliot calls "by far my most ambitious work in the Dark Engine to date", presumably including his previous group project The Black Parade, despite being "purely based on vibes". Called Reflections In Red, it's a sequel to Barrilliot's <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152800">Winds Of Misfortune</a>, though it works well as a standalone release. It's also based on a real-life castle so preposterous I have no choice but to immediately steal the deeds from what I assume is a heavily fortified bank vault inside a creepy mountain somewhere.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Reflections In Red has no bank vaults, nor creepy mountains, just majestic amphibious architecture. It sees light-fingered snarkyman Garrett heading to a manor built over a lake on the outskirts of Wychwood. He's here to pinch a recipe for some posh wine, by any means necessary. "Swim, sneak, or climb, the choice is mine," explains the intro, below. "Front gate's a death trap. Guards in plate, a captain and two sergeants keeping watch. The lord hates electricity, sticks to torches and gaslight. Perfect for someone like me. A few water arrows should do the trick."

<p>Long story short, it's a mansion raid with many points of entry and superb production values, inside and outside. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skacky.bsky.social/post/3m5yxqa73ds24">Posting on Bluesky</a>, Barrilliot concedes that it followed "a very unusual development cycle" and "wasn't even supposed to be a real mission at first, just a testbed for my own textures and a doodle based on <a href="https://www.nicolasdelort.com/illustration?pgid=ki3luwp3-ad5b13cd-8b7c-48aa-a53f-7e5277bd326d">this etching by artist Nicolas Delort</a>." (For clarity, I've added the link to speed the chain of reference here. Can't have you running off to Google them like a sap.)
</p><p>Barrilliot says he "had no document for this mission whatsoever. I just built it and it eventually coalesced into the final result." The castle takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.chenonceau.com/en/">Chenonceau Castle in France</a>, "which has some of the stupidest vanity architecture you'll ever find", in Barrilliot's estimation. I feel like quite a lot of videogame level design can be filed under "vanity architecture", though it's not a comparison I've thought about before.
</p>
<p>Up for it? You will first need Thief 2 version 1.28, which may mean you have to upgrade using T2Fix 1.28, as detailed alongside the download link on <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=153139">TTLG</a>. While Reflections In Red appears to have been Barrilliot's pet project, the mod features contributions from a few other Thief fan community members, including voice actors, writers, scripters and tool developers - find a full list in the Thanks section in the TTLG post.</p>
<p>Ah, Thief. I've kind of forgotten everything about the first two games, bizarrely, though I can quote certain bits of Hammerite scripture in my sleep. The third remains vivid in my mind thanks to the efforts of Kieron Gillen, co-founder of this parish, who once dedicated a whole PCGamer feature to its Shalebridge Cradle level. I remember Eidos Montreal's fourth Thief mostly for that time I choked out a guard and he carried on humming, though I thought it was solid enough as stealth games go.</p>
<p>If you call yourself a Thief enthusiast and you've yet to play Barrilliot's previous The Black Parade, you should get that wiped off your ledger pronto. Here's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-black-parade-is-a-thief-mod-from-a-team-including-a-dev-at-arkane-and-an-original-thief-designer">interview of our own with Barrilliot about its creation</a>, in which writer Lee Seymour confesses that "the thing is so jammed with fun surprises that anything more than a sketched overview feels like a spoiler."</p>

Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>

<p>This new report from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3m6eynx2ycc2f">People Make Games</a> cites an anonymous Rockstar insider as having passed on messages from the private Discord server Rockstar developers and IWGB staff were using to organise, with the insider claiming they believe these messages contributed to the firings. The alleged messages in question discuss and include snippets of text from internal Rockstar emails concerning a change in internal Slack policy, which the company reportedly announced to staff in the second week of October this year.</p>
<p>According to People Make Games, the policy changes included the removal of miscellaneous Slack channels which staff used for non-work related discussions, with Rockstar allegedly claiming these had become distracting and occasionally sources of poor conduct. The report claims that at least one of the two emails from Rockstar about the changes was sent out after 5PM UK time, with Rockstar staff reportedly only able to access their work emails while at the company office during work hours. Some members of the Discord who were still in office then allegedly shared information or quotes from the emails in the server, so staff who'd gone home could see and discuss them.</p>
<p>People Make Games claim Rockstar management then became aware of these messages when at least one non-union member of the Discord server reached out to them to express concern.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Asked about the Discord discussion of the Slack policy changes by People Make Games, IWGB union president Alex Marshall said the following:</p>
<blockquote>I think it is absolutely normal for people to be discussing their material conditions, whether that's bonuses, whether that's policies, whether that's anything like that. That's completely normal for staff to be doing that and for an employer to respond in a way that comes down so hard on that shows not only that they are governing by this lack of transparency, but they're also trying to govern by fear. They feel completely threatened by the idea of workers talking to each other and that's why they've taken this act to try and destroy the union, decimate any form of kind of solidarity being built between workers.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in UK Parliament</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister in the hopes of discussing what support may be offered to affected staff.</p>
