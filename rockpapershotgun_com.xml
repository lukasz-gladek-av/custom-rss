            <p>I have a narcissistic recurring daydream that consists of teleporting historical celebrities into the present so that I can show them bits of 21st century technology and absolutely blow their tiny, primordial minds.</p>
<p>"This deceptively pocket-sized contraption is a trillion times more powerful than your silly adding machines," I would tell Charles Babbage, brandishing my smashed Google Pixel phone. "Did the Wright Flyer have wifi?" I would ask Wilbur and Orville, pushing their faces against the window of a 747. "Put this in your pipe and smoke it," I would tell Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, menacing him with the trailer for Silver Palace, a new open world action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Chinese developers Silver Studio and publishers Elementa, which is notionally set in a Victorian metropolis.</p><!--more-->
<p>Silver Palace's Victorian metropolis has red phoneboxes, elegantly appointed trams, top hats, clocktowers, detectives and ballgowns. I imagine Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could just about keep pace with all that, though he might object to the plunging necklines and the overall loudness of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>But then I would show him the angel-winged anime girls, the power-drifting panther steeds, the neck-snapping finishers, the real-time character-swapping, the demons pretending to people who must be exposed using magic profiling functionality. "Why don't your Sherlock Holmes stories have glide mechanics?" I would sternly enquire of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he curled up sobbing into his hands.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one psychic defence would be to point out that his Sherlock Holmes stories don't contain any gacha mechanics, this being a curse peculiar to our so-called modern age. Fine, Doyle, I'll let you have that one. It's not clear what Silver Palace's gacha elements involve, but here's 11 minutes of gameplay overview to give you a sense of the whole.</p>

<p>Some press release blurb to finish: Silver Palace is the tale of Silvernia, a city powered by the "revolutionary element" of Silverium. You are a Detective who must delve into a shady world of corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, and hidden monsters. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be free-to-play.  There's no release date as yet.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the overclocked character designs but I do like the looks of that urban backdrop. Hopefully the open world element is pronounced enough to allow for a Crackdown-style collectathon. Also please may I have some kind of Watson, Silver Studio? Is that catgirl maid the equivalent of Watson in Silver Palace, and if so, can you please make her as creepy as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-2007">Creepy Watson</a> in Frogwares' games?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> owners will be familiar with the practice of peering into a new game’s Steam store page and hoping, begging, praying to whatever god is yet to abandon this cruel joke of a reality that it has a little green tick mark on it. This is, of course, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a>, wherein Valve gives good behaviour stickers to games that function fully on their handheld PC.</p>
<p>Soon, this system – so often a source of relief and disappointment – will be expanded, with a view to rating games for compatibility with SteamOS as a whole. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">announcement post</a> explains, that’s because the first non-Steam Deck SteamOS handheld, a new version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, is launching soon, with the possibility of more in the future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve’s compatibility testing staff presumably can’t try out every game on every possible SteamOS device, no matter how many wheeled desks they can roll into the office, as it's an open-source operating system that could feasibly run on any desktop or laptop. But they can, and apparently will, use data gleaned from their existing Steam Deck Verified testing to determine whether a game has or avoids problems with the OS in particular, subsequently rating it as either SteamOS Compatible or SteamOS Unsupported. With a nice blue tick for the former, aww. As with the current system’s Verified/Playable/Unsupported ratings, these will appear on store game pages and in the Steam libraries of anyone playing on a non-Steam Deck SteamOS PC.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lenovo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"We expect over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS Compatible out of the gate," sayeth the post. While these specific new categories don’t take framerate performance or control input functionality into account, as the Steam Deck ratings do, they should at least let you know if certain games are literal non-starters. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> seems due a SteamOS Unsupported tag, for instance, after it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">binned Linux support last year</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried the Legion Go S yet, and our adoptive cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">Ian Games Network</a> weren’t especially impressed with the Windows edition. But the current state of play among portable PCs definitely has SteamOS above Windows 11 as the more usable, comfortable, lightweight, and stable OS. One that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">surprisingly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">capable</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">running</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">non-Steam</a> games, too. As such, I’ll happily get on board with anything that both makes SteamOS patronship slightly easier and might encourage future handheld manufacturers to switch over. Valve expect as much, writing that "the only other officially supported device running SteamOS is Lenovo Legion Go S, but we see this expanding to more devices in the future."</p>
<p>Exciting times, then, if the concept of the Steam Deck has caught your eye but you’d rather wait and see what other hardware makers can do with a baggable form factor <em>and</em> Valve’s own OS. All that being said, one new, lower-spec handheld does not a sea change make, and the recently leaked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-some-leaked-images-of-an-xbox-branded-handheld-and-the-asus-rog-ally-2">Asus ROG Ally 2</a> looks to remain so tied up in Microsoft’s ecosystem that there’s a separate Xbox-branded version of it. Bet it doesn’t have tiny colourful ticks, mind.</p>

<p>Originally made in Unreal Engine 4, the remaster has been built in UE5, with a few quality-of-life features bundled in. Read them why don't you:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Game fully relit in Unreal Engine 5</li>
<li>Enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects</li>
<li>4K textures and improved reflections</li>
<li>Photo Mode</li>
<li>Support for DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling</li>
<li>Various gameplay adjustments, certain accessibility features and more</li>

<p>Originally released in 2019, Frogwares gained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-regain-control-of-the-sinking-city-but-all-old-saves-will-break-soon">full publishing rights to The Sinking City</a> last year following a legal battle with Nacon over royalties and funding, including allegations that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-devs-claim-publisher-pirated-the-game-to-release-it-on-steam">Nacon had pirated the game</a>. Frogwares are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-reveal-wet-survival-horror-sequel-the-sinking-city-2-taking-the-dev-in-a-newer-direction-in-2025">now working on a sequel</a>, which is slated for release sometime this year.</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) wasn't convinced by The Sinking City's take on Lovecraft or clumsy racism allegories <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">in her review</a>, but thought the game worked well enough otherwise, calling it "a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> - the apparently very good third-person action extravaganza with a heroine who definitely only dresses like that because she's comfortable with her sexuality and besides, bunny girl outfits are lightweight and tactically efficient - will launch on 11th June, according to a new trailer. PlayStation appear to have posted the trailer early in a classic case of marketing butterfingers. They've now removed the video, but somebody from Reddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">preserved and uploaded it</a> as an everlasting monument to Sony's shame.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The video walks us through a few of the PC version's new bells, whistles and features, including AI frame generation, higher resolutions, a bunch of bonus outfits, Japanese and Chinese voiceovers, a new boss fight, and ultrawide display support for players who are secretly owls with the ability to rotate their head almost 360 degrees. It all seems very swish. I like the spangly blocking effects.</p>
<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade was confirmed in February, at which time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jiggle-powered-apparently-decent-action-game-stellar-blade-confirmed-for-pc-release-in-june">I wrote a little about the console version's popularity/infamy among internet sexists</a>. To recap: this is very much an experience for people who like looking at shiny bottoms and wobbling chests. It also sounds like an accomplished graduate of Combo, Parry And Fishing Minigame University that deserves a lot of the praise it has received. Ah, history abhors a paradox.</p>
<p>I don't, personally, object to anybody wanting to look at a shiny bottom, providing their enthusiasm for shiny bottoms doesn't metastasise into e.g. the argument that Western civilisation is doomed thanks to a chronic dearth of bikini armour in Assassin's Creed. Anyway, we'll possibly have something less slapdash to say on the subject in June.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Not a shield in sight. Just old time, good time, down home rocket communists riding flying machines made of revolver parts, cannibalism, and a "hookshot-hat". Bafflingly, the trailer does not show the hookshot-hat, but I respect the restraint.</p>
<p>The west has been torn apart by the great War For Booze, and your once-idyllic family life has been shattered. So, you hop on your horse and set off to do some gun violence at communists over a series of open sandbox levels. Here are some features:</p>
<p>(Also, here's a grammar question for you, the discerning nitpicker. I always want write to "here's some features" but that's technically not correct because there's multiple features, but "here are some features" just feels so unnecessarily drawn out I want to expire and crumble into dust before I reach the end of the sentence. It's a bloody conundrum, it is! Little insight into the tortuous struggle I experience in the daily process of sausage making, there.)</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Story driven adventure set in open sandbox-like levels.</li>
<li>Dynamic slapstick combat.</li>
<li>Equipment system with upgradeable weapons and clothing.</li>
<li>Trading and cooking systems.</li>
<li>First person rolling, bullet catching, kicking, hookshot-hat, cannibalism, drinking booze and puking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The description of "dynamic slapstick combat" puts me in mind of Blendo Games' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. I read something the other day about how one of the purposes of narrative design is to make the things you do in games seem less weird and stupid, but I'm a supporter of leaning into the opposite. I'm also reading Blood Meridian for the first time at the moment, and feel this would make an incredibly incongruent but just similar enough companion piece to make both experiences much stupider.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tackling the game's story mode, HunterIV4 took the approach of bumping up their party's health as much as possible. It sounds like they had a fairly easy time through the game's first act, although they had to focus more heavily on effective builds for the latter portion. Personally, I enjoyed the buildcraft in Clair Obscur so much it's been a little disheartening to see it overshadowed by the Sekiro comparisons and what not. I do think this is partially a quirk of the design, since you can technically make the character building meaningless by just getting very good at button pressing. Still: good to hear that it does have the capacity to play like a more traditional turn-base 'em up.</p>
<p>HunterIV4 ended the second of their two posts with screenshots of both final bosses beaten with zero parries or  dodges. "Don't let concerns about a 'hardcore' experience prevent you from playing this awesome game and experiencing the story first-hand," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kfc7mz/no_dodgeparry_an_experiment_and_what_to_do_if_you/">they wrote</a>. "Despite the hype, this is not <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>."</p>
<p>Granted, this doesn't sound like the best way to experience the game - Act I took them much longer that they'd have like, apparently. But, hopefully it's tempted a few more of you to join the cult of Esquie's magnificent ass. The time of the airship is over, now is the age of the dump truck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
