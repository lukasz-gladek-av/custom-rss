            <p>Ok, before you get angry, all I know is that the Home Alone guy's playing someone either in Caesar's Legion or who dresses as a member of Caesar's Legion, not that he's nailed on to be wolf hat bloke. I just liked the headline. Now that disclaimer's out of the way, Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> has gotten another trailer ahead of its December 17th debut.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-radiates-new-vegas-with-a-trailer-heavy-on-stupid-sexy-house-and-a-december-debut-date">previous trailers</a> have outlined, this chain of episodes is set in NEW VEGAS. That's NEW VEGAS, the setting of obscure 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: NEW VEGAS</a>. There are characters, factions and things from NEW VEGAS, which the established cast will be interacting with because they're heading to NEW VEGAS. Capische?</p>

<p>As you can see the new trailer above, Amazon wished to show off many things this time around. Ghoulified Kings, a radroach exploding into goo atop a man, a man with an extra mouth on his chest. There's moralising about how you can't be a very nice person if you've had to grow up outside of a vault, those underground places which famously never have bad things happen in them.</p><p>Lucy, Ella Purnell's vault dweller, is searching for her dad following the events of the first series. Walton Goggins' ghoul, who's teased to have a past with the NCR here, is searching for his family. Brotherhood of Steel soldierman Maximus is preparing for what looks like some version of New Vegas' NCR vs Legion vs House war, but this time with the Brotherhood in all their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> airshipy glory, rather being them being in the more intriguing scenario of having lost a war to a much bigger army that had the numbers to trump their hoarded tech.</p>
<p>I assume he'll keep building bonds with fellow Brotherhooders which result in them feeling like family to him, then a bad thing will happen to one of said people, so he isn't left out of the family hunting. I'm being flippant, though. No other show would be cool enough to have legion-armoured Macaulay Culkin watch a guy spit out some blood. Bad things in general seem to be happening to the legion here, as a tent in their camp blows up.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch what I said earlier, Maximus looks to be wearing some sort of power armour version of the iconic NCR ranger getup later on. Has he bought the <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/fallout4/details/7fc565f2-eaf5-458b-9ec6-55490432970d/Tale_of_the_Beast_Hunter">extra expensive anniversary edition</a> of series two? Or is he using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9034">mods</a>? Maybe he's hunting for some relation to ask for load order advice.</p>
<p>We'll find out on December 17th, in NEW VEGAS. Well, on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

            <p>"Season...6..." I gasp through a parched throat and unwashed beard. "Need...season 6...of popular subterranean co-op shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, developed by Ghost Ship Games..."</p>
<p>Mr. Ghost Ship himself stands over my skeletal body, knees and elbows shredded to the sinew from nearly a year and a half of crawling through the update desert. "How about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/impressive-dwarf-vs-alien-autoshooter-deep-rock-galactic-survivor-burrows-out-of-early-access">1.0 release</a>, or our upcoming, if sadly delayed, roguelike spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a>?"</p>
<p>"I mean...they’re alright," I croak. "But season...siiiiiiiiiix..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," he concedes. "It’s called Relics of Hoxxes and it’s out in Q1 2026, which in English is between January and March."</p>
<p>"Ah...nice."</p>

<p>Nice indeed. OG Deep Rock’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-deep-rock-galactic-season-5-drills-back-down-to-basics">season 5</a> left the sci-fi dwarf delver in good shape before its developers shifted focus to getting Rogue Core ready for an early access release. But, an unexpectedly lengthy investment in the latter has in turn pushed back a return to DRG Prime’s seasonal schedule. Ghost Ship have now announced that while Rogue Core is being delayed further to Q2 (April to June) 2026, season 6 – which was originally going to release <em>after</em> the spinoff – is instead coming first, having been put together under supervision by fellow Danish studio and Neighbours: Suburban Warfare devs Invisible Walls.</p><p>Outsourcing is a risky business, but I’m liking how meaty Relics of Hoxxes looks. Set after your mineral-hungry employers tunnelled into the unexplored pits of bugworld Hoxxes IV, it adds the first new biome in years: Ossuary Depths, an eery, decaying cave realm where the bones of the dead litter the ground like McDonald’s wrappers on Woolwich high street. Yours might join them, if your mining team falls foul of the new breed of Ossiran enemies. In contrast to the spider-like Glyphids, the Ossiran come bearing bitey, stag beetle-ish pincers; confirmed variants include the pesky flying Scrab and the Pit Jaw, who lies in wait underground before chomping on intruders like a hungry landmine. We’ve been kindly provided with these behind-the-scenes images showing how, precisely, they’ll fuck up a Driller.</p>
<p>Step 1: Don’t do this.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Step 2: No, idiot, you did this.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Coffee Stain Publishing</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There’s also the Bone Collector, a cowardly sort who’ll flee into Ossiran-dug side-tunnels when spotted. You can track them back to their nests and loot their hoard of valuable minerals, provided you can survive any counter-ambush by the bugs whose home you’ve just ransacked.</p><p>A new mission type is part of the season 6 package, too. Heavy Extraction excursions see your crew locating and digging out a vast chunk of amber somewhere on the map, before strapping it with rocket boosters to send it soaring back up to the Space Rig. It doesn’t sound as intricate or as dramatic as, say, season 5’s Deep Scan missions, which crescendoed with a silly-fun ride on a massive drilling platform, but look, it’s been seventeen months. A dwarf’s gotta eat. Heavy Extractions will immediately start appearing in the weekly Deep Dives too, once the new season lands.</p>



<p>"We’ve worked closely with our friends at Invisible Walls to help shape season 6 into the best possible experience for our community," Ghost Ship game director Mikkel Martin Pedersen said in a statement. "After six months of working together and exploring different concepts for DRG expansions, we’re confident in the team’s vision for the upcoming season, while we work hard on the future of the Deep Rock Galactic franchise and Rogue Core."</p><p>On the topic of Rogue Core, a delay to mid-2026 means it’s missing its original 2025 window. I think that’s for the best – I’ve played some of the current closed alpha and it’s promising, particularly in a "Hey, this actually <em>does</em> feel different to regular Deep Rock" kind of way, which I didn’t expect upon its reveal in 2023. But it’s also, quite clearly, still working itself out. The synergy between classes isn’t as enjoyably tight as in DRG, and while I see the basic appeal of a more dangerous, action-heavy approach, the builds I’ve played have thus far felt slightly <em>too</em> sweaty for me to see myself putting another...Christ, 553 hours into Rogue Core like I have with the original game.</p>
<p>In fairness, an alpha is but an alpha, and it’s still getting substantial updates. Just last week, Alpha Update 04 added a brand new dwarf class: Retcon, a time-rewinding trickster who can revert to an earlier state to gain back health and ammo, or even salvage a run if the whole team gets downed at once. I’m obviously more desperate for the nourishment of season 6, but I’ll be checking in Rogue Core’s continued progress.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, the reveal of Sloclap’s Rematch sent me into spirals of introspection about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creators-of-sifu-and-absolver-are-making-a-football-game-set-many-decades-from-now">the classist origins of my apathy for football</a>. Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is sending me into spirals of introspection about the fact that maybe football was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> all along. Hypersonic penalty kicks that wreathe the ball in purple fire? Nobody told me football was this rad. So many years wasted, playing effing grass hockey.
</p>
<p>
Created by Level5 Inc – the studio behind such classics as Dragon Quest 8, the Professor Layton series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered">Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</a>, together with the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, it’s a blend of open-ended school yarn and fantasy soccer with 5,400 characters to recruit.</p>
<p>There have been a few of these Inazuma Eleven games, it turns out, but this is the first mainline entry in 12 years, and the first time they’ve released one for PC. It seems smashing. Smashing! I don’t care that I sound like somebody out of the Beano. I don't care that the centre-forwards all sprint like they're battling to restrain the aftermath of a hastily eaten curry. I watched the trailer below and the score brought wholly non-curry-related tears to my eyes.

SMASHING. Let’s proceed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=4777282">the Steam page</a> without further ado. Dear lord, it’s a tawdry logjam of special edition bonuses and bolt-on preorder tat. I read <a href="https://indiegamejoe.com/steam-store-page-optimization-above-the-fold-best-practices/">a blog post about how to structure a Steam page</a> earlier and this pretty much breaks every rule on it. Keep scrolling, however, and you’ll eventually discover the game's premise.

“This new story takes place 25 years after the first Inazuma Eleven,” the developers explain. “In search of a world without football, protagonist Destin Billows enrolls at South Cirrus Junior High. Meanwhile, within the prestigious Raimon Junior High - renowned as the top team in the nationals - rises a Football Monster named Harper Evans. When these two cross paths, a tale begins to unfold…” The story sequences include animations supplied by MAPPA, producers of such anime films and adaptations as Dorohedoro, Chainsaw Man and Zombie Land Saga.

I can’t bring you any hands-on Victory Road impressions, sadly, as we’ve only just been offered code, and I’m worried the code offering person is a phisher. But there is much enthusiasm in the Steam forums, with the caveat that a lot of it is from advanced access buyers who are perhaps dabbling in a little sunk cost fallacy.

            <p>Over 200 staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar North have signed a letter to management calling for the "immediate reinstatement" of 31 workers fired recently by the company. Rockstar claimed they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired these staffers for "gross misconduct"</a>, subsequently accusing them of sharing confidential info publicly. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The union have also held protests outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two's UK offices</a>.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/rockstar-open-letter-13-11-25/">according to the IWGB</a>, a letter signed by 220 staff at Edinburgh-based Rockstar North has been delivered to the studio's management. The letter calls for the "immediate reinstatement" of the fired workers, and condemns the decision to boot them out of their jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>"It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Meanwhile, IWGB organiser Fred Carter called the firings an "Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry". More union protests against Rockstar are planned in the very near future, with an 8AM rally outside Take Two’s London office and a 4PM CET protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters - the latter staged by the French STJV (Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo) union - set to take place on November 14th. There's also a protest set to take place at 6PM on November 18th outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, timed to coincide with a cross-party parliamentary group meeting about the Scottish games industry.</p>
<p>GTA 6 remains a spectre now lurking on November 19th, 2026, following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">most recent delay</a> around the time news of the firings broke.</p>
