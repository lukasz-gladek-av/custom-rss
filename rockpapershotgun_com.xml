Saber and Focus Entertainment Publishing have announced Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3, another bloody serving of Adeptus Astarting with a fresh single player campaign and multiplayer component, plus unspecified "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games". Saber will work on the new action game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which they assure us will continue to receive updates for "years".

<p>
The press release in question is crammed to the visor with talk of "new heights" and suchlike, but does not, alas, contain any real details about Space Marin3, or any images beyond some key art depicting Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first two games. Still, it seems safe to say that he'll be taking his chainsword to a different bunch of marauding aliens and heretics in the threequel. The first Space Marine was all about Orks and Chaos, the second one was Tyranids and Chaos. Maybe the Drukhari and Chaos next time? Possibly the T'au Empire? I've heard they're actually quite nice.
</p>
<p>
The line about "redefining the standards of third-person action" is from John Bert, Focus Entertainment Publishing's deputy CEO. There's also some chinwaggery in the release from Saber SEO Matthew Karch, who notes that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">well-wrought</a> and best-selling Space Marine 2 has been "transformative" for Saber, a company that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">until recently languished in the claws of cheery job-loss merchants Embracer</a>. "While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment," Karch writes. 
</p>
<p>
The release concludes with the note that parent company Pullup Entertainment (previously Focus Entertainment - I guess they've decided they need to hit the gym more often) have a revenue announcement on April 17th 2025. Perhaps we'll hear more about Space Marine 3 then.

<p>Any hopes to share at this point? I would like a more knowing take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">the Imperium's fascism</a>. I would also like Titus to get himself all chopped up and converted into a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreadnought">Dreadnought</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
