            <p>How long do you tend to spend creating a character in a video game? The correct answer is three hours. Four hours if it's a Bethesda game, because creating a character in a Bethesda game is like rewinding the Raiders Of The Lost Ark face-melting scene while shooting at your TV with Homer Simpson's Make-Up Gun. It takes patience to extract beauty or even just plain inoffensiveness from the Creation Engine's sticky coils.</p>
<p>Hang on, why am I being mean to Bethesda? I should be directing my snide remarks at Capcom. It turns out the scalliwags want you to pay a small fee to edit your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> character's voice, face and body structure more than once - so if you're buying today, you might want to spend a few more hours perfecting that Hunter physique at start-up.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes care of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/">VGC</a>, who've spotted a Monster Hunter Wilds - Character Edit Voucher: Three-Voucher Pack <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648">on Steam</a>, currently priced at £5.49, €6.99 or $6.99. Each voucher lets you "redo your character creation and debut a new look". The base game includes access to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/?curator_clanid=4777282">one of these vouchers for free</a>. There's a similar DLC voucher pack for your Palico, a catlike helper that accompanies you through the wastes.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of nickel-and-diming I wouldn't call this abysmal, because I seldom feel the need to fundamentally redesign my character more than once. My current Monster Hunter Wilds character looks like an ailing prog rock musician, and I'm confident that's a vibe that'll carry me to the credits. Besides which, you can still give your Hunter a <em>cosmetic</em> makeover without handing over your lunch money to Capcom: the base game lets you "edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher".</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit cheeky. A reminder that somewhere above the artwork you're enjoying sit a bunch of salivating men in bow ties and tophats, holding comically oversized knives and forks.</p>
<p>Capcom have form for this kind of thing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/critically-acclaimed-dragons-dogma-2-hits-mostly-negative-on-steam-after-players-raze-it-for-microtransactions">garlanded</a> with 21 pieces of DLC at launch, offering optional paid access to items used for fast travel, self-revival and hiring allies. It's more thematically appropriate to Monster Hunter, perhaps, in that Monster Hunter is a game about carving things up into sellable commodities and raw materials. Wilds has been on sale for a few hours and already has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/">40 items of DLC</a> - I'd say they're flogging every part of the pig except the squeal, but there's probably a Squeal Voucher in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
