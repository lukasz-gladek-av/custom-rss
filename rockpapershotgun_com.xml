            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>' director Ryosuke Horii has addressed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-fans-are-demanding-sega-recast-a-kiwami-3-actor-and-dark-ties-may-make-the-situation-worse">controversial casting of actor Teruyuki Kagawa in the remake</a>, which has resulted in fan backlash due to a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022">2022 report from Shukan Shincho</a> detailing sexual assault allegations against the actor. Kagawa apologised at the time, but didn't specify what he was apologising for or confirm the events reported in Shukan Shincho's article.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking about Kagawa's casting as Kiwami 3 secondary antagonist Goh Hamazaki in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2077376.html">GAME Watch</a>, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">IGN</a> have subsequently translated, Horii said the following:</p>
<blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote>
<p>The RGG Studio developer also added that not recasting characters like Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro - the latter a key ally of Kiwami 3 protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, played in the new version of the game by Show Kasamatsu - would have "certainly be safer" in terms of avoiding "online criticism". However, Horii said, RGG "felt there was no use being afraid".</p><p>As of writing, Horii's comments are the only response RGG Studio have made to the backlash against Kagawa's casting in the remake. Publishers Sega declined to provide a statement on the matter when approached for comment by RPS last month. I've reached out to Sega for comment again in light of Horii's comments.</p>
<p>As of writing, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3">fan petition</a> calling for Kagawa to be removed from his role as Goh Hamazaki in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 has amassed just under 10,000 signatures. The remake is set to release later this week.</p>
