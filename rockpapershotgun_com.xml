            <p>
The end of a very short era is here! I guess, if you care about the life cycles of tech products made by multi-billion dollar companies. It appears that the days of the original LCD model of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> is coming to an end, as a quiet notice from Valve suggests their focus will be with the slightly newer, shinier OLED line of handheld gaming devices.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/valve-discontinuing-the-last-steam-deck-lcd-model/">GamingOnLinux</a>, heading to the store page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a> sees you being greeted with the usual spiel about how good it is, the games you can play on it, which models you can buy, and now, this note: "We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available." That kind of says it all really, but essentially, if you were putting off buying one, don't like buying tech second hand, and aren't particularly fussed about screen quality, there's your warning.
</p>
<p>
The original Steam Deck, this LCD model, launched back in February, 2022, so we're coming up to its fourth anniversary. Our own James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-review">liked it quite a lot back then</a>, and then a little under two years after it launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-the-steam-deck-oled-with-an-upgraded-screen-and-longer-battery-life">Valve announced the OLED model</a>. No real surprise there considering those Nintendo guys did the same thing, the difference there being they're still shifting original Switches alongside the OLED upgrade. I can only assume that Valve just aren't selling enough of the LCD version to justify its continued production.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next big thing for Valve right now is their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">new attempt at a Steam Machine</a>. A new Steam Deck will surely come at some point, though according to the House of Gabe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-have-to-keep-waiting-for-a-steam-deck-2-because-valve-says-the-tech-isnt-there-for-it-just-yet">you'll be waiting a while longer for it</a>. Perhaps an LCD model is all any of us really need right now.

            <p>
I've always found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Big Brand Collabs slightly odd, if a touch humorous. They don't always make much sense to me, like the SpongeBob one, though I will admit that the Shrek one does feel like a good fit, even if I am loath to look at intellectual property. And now here we are with its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, with its first bit of DLC freshly announced, sending prospective powerwashers off to a distant land called Ooo from the seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to a brief Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/542251341653737956?l=english">blog post</a>, this particular bit of DLC will feature a total of five locations from the animated series, due out in spring, 2026. Not much was actually shown off of the pack itself, but the math fans out there will not be particularly surprised to see Finn and Jake's permanent residence the tree house, as well as the castle belonging to the Ice "wow this guy was a bit too creepy early on in the series, sure glad they toned that done" King.

<p>
A roadmap was outlined for upcoming DLC and updates coming to PowerWash Simulator 2, with two more paid packs coming in Q2 and Q3, alongside three rounds of Caldera Chronicles jobs that'll be available completely for free. Other free updates promised in the roadmap include very vague things like new features, bug fixes and quality of life improvements, furniture and skins, and community events - all which is caveated with a note that says "content could change based on community feedback or development in the future."
</p><p>
I'm sure some of that will be even more collabs, such is the way of the world, but I'm sure there will be at least a few of you out there who will be happy to clean up bits of the world of Adventure Time. A very specific thing to be happy about! Happy nonetheless.

            <p>
I mean, all you can do is laugh, right? You've probably already guessed at what based on the headline, but we'll dig a little deeper into this all the same. Yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> has been delayed, the same Ark 2 that was revealed almost exactly five years ago, that was at one point in time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-is-out-in-2023-and-its-all-about-dads-dinos-and-vin-diesel">promised to release in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-has-been-delayed-so-theyre-switching-off-survival-evolved-and-charging-50-for-a-remaster">2024</a>, and then sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">half-heartedly slated for 2027</a>, before landing where we are now, with the news that the game is currently planned for release in 2028. Uhuh!
</p>
<p>
This comes from an interview with Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz over on the Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">blog</a> (stop stealing our thing, Mr. Sweeney. "One of the things about doing ARK 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases," Stieglitz said of the delay. "Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called ARK 2."
</p>
<p>
The studio founder spoke of how an expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> due for release in 2027, Legacy of Santiago, will introduce a number of combat mechanics that are planned for Ark 2, like its Soulsian third-person combat, but "it's not going to have all this like crazy narrative world build out content that we want to do with Ark 2."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of that narrative, it frankly, sounds like a mess. Stieglitz shared that they have a "much more ambitious narrative built out for Ark 2," but noted that, bafflingly, "it’s really going to be highly dependent on just how involved Vin Diesel is actually going to be, which is still an open question." 
</p><p>
He goes on to note that they currently do not know how many days, or even hours, they're going to get with the Fast &amp; Furious actor. "The scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do."
</p>
<p>
This, perhaps, is a lesson in not announcing your game with a pre-rendered trailer featuring a very famous and wildly mediocre actor who's too busy feuding with another mediocre actor. I await hearing about the game's next delay in 2029 with little glee, but much anticipation.
