            <p>
Let's start this one with a definition: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is "one of those kinda games." By that I mean it's a four player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> title that doesn't really adhere to a particular genre, predominantly prioritising mechanics that allow you and some friends to get up to some shenanigans. Like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, or REPO, you know, one of those kinda games! Now we've got that out of the way, let me introduce you to Roadside Research, one of those kinda games, except this time you are an incredibly poorly disguised alien running a gas station in order to research humans. See what I mean?
</p>

<p>
It's a delectably silly concept, right down to said disguises literally just being bits of paper taped to the grey (and not grey) aliens' faces. In terms of the moment to moment gameplay, you'll be doing things a perfectly regular human working at a gas station would do: restock shelves, refuel customers' cars, "exchange goods for cash."

<p>
You'll need to cook and clean too, I'm assuming that second one is those hot dogs that roll on those spinning poles you're 100% sure have never been cleaned. Once you've finished a day's work, you can upgrade your gas station - again, a typical human thing to do - to help bring in more people the following day.
</p>
<p>
There's Men in Black-looking government officials to avoid too, for a bit of a threat. Overall it just looks like a silly good time, I'm not massively into online co-op games generally, but this recent trend of comedy online co-op games where there's often not really any violence is certainly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
Roadside Research doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3643170/Roadside_Research/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.

How do you follow up a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/umurangi-generation">Umurangi Generation</a>? Maybe move from photography to videography, or go full shooter (which developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/origame-digital">Origame Digital</a> do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/umurangi-generation-dev-teases-new-horror-game-inspired-by-metal-gear-and-silent-hill">appear to be making too</a>, that one's just not had a full reveal yet). Perhaps instead of either of those things, you'll make a game about penguins, which, yeah, no more beating around the bush, that's exactly what they've done. Introducing: Penguin Colony, a narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game based on H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a> explains that this is a "radically different perspective" from the original piece of literature, in part because you play as a penguin who hears the "echoes of our narrator describing his plight." It's looking like it's somewhat level-based too, letting you waddle, slide, and swim around, discovering what happened "at your own pace." A pretty chill sounding time for a game with such heavy source material!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the narrator isn't having a great time, his brain experiencing time out of order after being called by "the old ones," leaving you, a simple penguin, the only one that can help him. Good stuff.
</p>
<p>
There even seems to be a suitable amount of gaminess to it too, as you can unlock different penguins for replays. They all have different abilities and challenges too, one of them being a baby penguin so you can fit in smaller gaps, but you can't swim.
</p>
<p>
Look, Umurangi Generation is up there as one of my games of the decade, so I'll be here day one whenever it does drop. Over on the Umurangi Generation Discord server, lead developer Veselok said that a trailer and demo will be turning up in the coming months, so my advice is to wishlist the game on Steam if you're interested in checking it out.
