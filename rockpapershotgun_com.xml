<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, the troubled sequel to dino husbandry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, will "hopefully" launch into early access by 2027, according to Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz. The key question appears to be when to shift the focus away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the original Ark's Unreal Engine 5 revamp, which launched in early access in 2023. Also, designing a Soulslike combat system is hard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">PCGamesN</a>, Stieglitz explained that Studio Wildcard had a vertical slice (loosely defined, a demo that shows off all aspects of the final game) for Ark 2 prior to Survival Ascended's launch. But the devs "felt that as a team, it would be very difficult to follow that all the way through to a complete game with both our experience level and [our scope] as a company". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz says the developers needed to get their heads around Unreal Engine 5 before taking a swing at Ark 2, and in particular, its new Soulslicorice combat system. "It's very difficult to do soulslike combat in a multiplayer PvP context," Stieglitz went on. "You could probably count the number of games on one hand that have even attempted that in an actual PvP context."
</p>
<p>(FromSofties may be in uproar over this last claim - in his defence, Stieglitz is presumably referring to games like Ark that allow dozens of players per public session. Still, by all means count up the alternatives and prove him wrong. I'd do it but I need both these hands to type with.)</p>
<p>
Right now, "a small portion" of Studio Wildcard are working to "refine" the mechanics of that old Ark 2 vertical slice. Stieglitz reckons it'll take "18 months of hardcore team focus to [turn] that vertical slice into an early access game, when we get to put the vast majority of our team back on it." He thinks Ark 2 will launch into early access "hopefully within the next two years", but it all depends on when Studio Wildcard decide to shift their efforts away from Survival Ascended.
</p>
<p>
Aside from dancing the Soulslike Fantastic with the new brontosaurus-punching mechanics, Studio Wildcard intend to feature proper NPC antagonists in Ark 2, "because that's been implied by the trailer and has been part of our design for quite some time as an opposing force, so to speak". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz wants to "add a lot more threat level to the environment and the feeling of being able to enjoy a PvP-like experience, even without [fighting against other players]." He's also gunning for a user-generated content system that works more "seamlessly under the hood while you're playing the game", rather than being presented as a menu.
</p>
<p>
Survival Evolved players may not be too tickled to hear of the present commitment to Survival Ascended. The Unreal Engine revamp launched in October 2023 with some new creatures and structures, but without much of Survival Evolved's expansion content. In the process, Giant Squid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-evolveds-official-servers-switch-off-in-just-a-few-hours-paving-the-way-for-remake">took the original game's servers offline</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As the developers have hitherto made plain, Ascended exists in large part to fund Ark 2's development, not just help them cut their teeth on a new engine or git gud at parrying. Initially, they were planning to launch it in a bundle with a $50 Ark 2 pre-order, but players swarmed the comms like testy oviraptors, and the developers ultimately released Ascended by itself for $45, before launch discounts. It now has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">a DLC roadmap that runs till end of 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad blood continues to swirl. Steam user reviews for Ascended remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/#app_reviews_hash">mixed</a>, and the original Ark <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">has more players on Steam right now</a>, despite the loss of official server support. Still, I'm sure Studio Wildcard will keep plugging on with it, because after all, confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as...

            <p>Ok, so you remember how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> arrived on PC and immediately there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">more smutty mods</a> than you could shake a fleshy stick at?</p>
<p>Well, the new Zone Kit modding tools <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> got as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">yesterday's big patch</a> have done something similar, but with memey jank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd expect given the Zone Kit takes up a very small 700GB of your hard drive and only came out the other day, there aren't too many mods out there that make use of it. However, taking a glance at how its <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2?date_live=Last+year">Mod.IO</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1643320/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> pages are building up at this early stage, there are still a number of works that'll, er, transform your zoning experience.</p>
<p>Homing in on Mod.IO specifically, 19 of the 61 mods currently up on there are by the same author, Sanekum, whom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-artist-kickstarts-the-zone-kit-modding-scene-with-a-flood-of-glorious-nonsense-mods-featuring-shrek-cj-and-you-guessed-it-thomas-the-tank-engine/">PC Gamer</a> note looks like they could be GSC 3D Artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sanekum">Aleksandr Silantev</a>.</p>
<p>That 31.15% (I have double checked the maths) of the total Stalker mods on the platform include the likes of <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/swampboss2#description">Shrek</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/cj-bloodsucker#description">CJ</a> from San Andreas cameos, but as a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-i-saw-her">serious</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">journalist</a> I'm interested in keeping things <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>. To that end, Sanekum offers the chance to pick up an <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/rpg-melee-combat#description">RPG grenade</a>, or an even deadlier <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/melee-nettle-branch#description">nettle branch</a>, and attempt to beat to death some <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sherman-boar#description">Sherman tanks</a> that've been drafted in to replace boars.</p>
<p>What do you mean that's not <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>? Clearly the Sherman tanks are being operated by the boars, who've just been magicked inside of them and given the sort of army training required to operate an armoured fighting vehicle with their little hooves. In the same way that <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sidorovich-handgun#description">this mod</a> which turns a mini-Sidorovich into a handgun makes perfect anatomical sense.
</p>
<p>Aside from those, a fair few of these early Mod.IO works for Stalker look to be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1312">existing</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/634">things</a> from places like Nexus Mods being <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/weapon-reposition-project-tacticool#description">ported</a> <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/main-menu-animated-ferris-wheel-4k60fps#description">across</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be cool to see what Stalker's notoriously enthusiastic modding community can get up to once they've had time to buy an entire new PC just to ensure they've got the space needed to install the Zone Kit and a chance to play around with it properly. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-some-nettles-defeat-wild-pigs-in-sherman-tanks-thanks-to-stalker-2s-new-modding-tools-you-can-find-out]]></content:encoded>
