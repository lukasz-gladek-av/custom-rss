            <p>Yep, that sound you can hear is the pounding footsteps of a certain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> minutefellow. He's coming to tell you that another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> settlement may soon need your help, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">modder</a>'s figured out how to let folks build stuff using the likes of rocks and beams as they play.</p>
<p>It's not quite got all the bells and whistles of a full settlement building system yet, but its creator is hoping to find someone to collab with on putting together exactly that.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right now, MadAborModding's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4648?tab=description">settlement building proof of concept</a> lets you spawn in world objects, adjust where they're placed on the fly, and then save them in place to make permanent additions to the world. It's a bit rudimentary at current, but there are "over 12,000 spawnable objects" at your fingertips, plus the ability to put 'em wherever you like and have them be there whenever you load up the game.</p>
<p>To build, you start by either using your left and right arrow keys to scroll through the spawnable objects in a random order or save time by adding the exact ones you want to one of the mod's LUA files. From there you look at and use the up arrow on the stone wall, beam or rock you're adding in to pick it up. You'll need to put it down once to enable its collision physics, then pick it up again to place it where you want.</p>
<p>V and B move it up and down, while Z, X, and C rotate it. Once you're done, you press backspace to save your placed stuff, with the mod recording these as ini files it'll then load up next time you start the game. These ini files are also able to be copied out of the game files if you want to share a creation with other people and let them load it into their game.</p>
<p>"I hope someone expands this into an actual settlement system," the modder wrote, "My goal with uploading this is hopefully to bait someone into doing that." They added that they're open to working with other interested parties to make that happen, with categorising objects and making menus being the aspects they'd need the most help pulling off.</p>
<p>What makes his so cool is that Oblivion Remastered still lacks official modding tools, with modders left to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-potential-pinnacle-of-elder-scrolls-modding-reckons-pioneer-modder">push boundaries and experiment</a> with the tools they do have. That often means there's more to install on the player's end to account for the processes at play behind-the-scenes being <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">less straightforward</a>, which makes it impressive that all MadAborModding's creation looks to require is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS for OblivionRemastered</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Six or so years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypixels-riot-backed-hytale-announced">an announcement trailer</a> that made it clear people had an appetite for their game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y building and survival shenanigans (it's got 61 million views to date), Hypixel Studios have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled. On top of that, the studio themselves are gearing up for closure.</p>
<p>Hytale's development kicked off all the way back in 2015, with its devs being the folks behind the huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-biggest-servers">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> publisher Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-have-bought-hytale-developers-hypixel-studios">bought the studio</a> in 2020, not long after we learned that Hytale would have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-have-undead-chickens">undead chickens</a>, and not long before the game's target release year started being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," Hypixel co-founder Noxy wrote in <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">an update post</a> on the studio's website, "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p>
<p>He went on to paint a picture of feature creep lining the road to the game's demise, explaining:</p>
<blockquote>Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game. We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Noxy added that the studio did try to seek out "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward" once Riot had made the call to pull its backing, but this looks to have come to nought. With Hypixel Studios now "winding down", the co-founder thanked the publisher for providing "generous severance and resources" to staff who're being laid off.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Hypixel's Minecraft server will continue to run as normal despite the cancellation and impending closure.</p>
<p>It's a really unfortunate end for Hytale, assuming the game isn't able to be resurrected in some way further down the line, especially given the decade Hypixel put into developing it. "We’re proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next," Noxy wrote to close out his post.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developers The Chinese Room have laid off a number of staff, seemingly as part of parent company Sumo Digital's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">wider strategic decision in February 2025</a> to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, several Chinese Room devs took to LinkedIn last week to post about leaving the studio.</p>
<p>VFX artist Jamie Berry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341430185805680640/">writes</a> that "the scourge of redundancy has struck". Technical producer Pascal Siddons <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascal-siddons-9aa255133_we-are-none-of-us-safe-from-the-headsmans-activity-7341109140871639040-X1eh/">adds</a> that "we are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around". 3D animator Bradly Adams and senior environment artist Adam Sharp <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341127507061956608/">both</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341437875885903873/">observe</a> less colourfully that "my current role and many others have been affected by recent events".</p>
<p>The Chinese Room have yet to give a comment on the situation, but Game Developer have confirmed with Sumo Group that several members of the company's Content &amp; Communications team have been affected by the company's recently announced change of direction. Sumo haven't shared a timeframe or any other details about these departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PCGamer</a>, meanwhile, have picked up a statement from Bloodlines 2 publishers Paradox Interactive, who insist that all this redundancy rigmarole will not affect the game's planned October release. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," a Paradox representative told the site. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed so often it may well be subject to some kind of ancient curse. Once in the hands of Hardsuit Labs, it was transferred to The Chinese Room in 2021, becoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more "spiritual successor" than sequel</a> in the process. Still, this week's revelations are more about Sumo than vampires and their masquerades.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2003 and acquired by Tencent in 2021, Sumo have a long history of work-for-hire projects, including many spells as lead dev on games like the fairly smashing Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. They had recently been experimenting with original games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a> via their own publishing label, Secret Mode, but the last couple of years have been rocky. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-warhammer-40000-boltgun-and-deathsprint-66-makers-to-lay-off-hundreds-off-staff">cut hundreds of staff</a> in June 2024 while closing Canadian studio Timbre Games (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/timbre-games-is-going-indie-after-being-shuttered-by-sumo-group">who have since resurfaced as an indie</a>).</p>
<p>In February this year, the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">announced</a> that "we must balance our creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business", acknowledging that "unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people." Best of luck to all the everyday humans impacted by these rebalancings.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Carcinisation comes for us all, in time. Today, it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s turn. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455990749">crustacean nation mod</a> adds four legendary lords, heroes, 27 crabulous units, new spells, plus custom tech and building trees for a complete crab-paign experience. It would have been shellfish of me not to share, if not downright altruistic to avoid any and all crab puns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I played a few turns as King Crab, who appears have to appropriated Greasus Goldtooth's crown and sceptre, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't suit him. You start on the eastern coast of the Empire, at war with a Marienburger lord named "Simon Crab-Hunter' and some Norscans. Your unique campaign mechanic here is a resource named Gleaming Shells, which you'll spend on commands similar to Karl Franz's - refresh army movement range ("scuttle onward"), make yourself immune to trespassing penalties, and so on. You also start with two units of crab knights, which are crabs riding bigger crabs.</p>
<p>The mod is by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023503085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710">Pegaz</a>, who's made several others for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, such as some unique <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412700662">Ogre Maneaters</a>. As with most custom faction mods, you'll need <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859968660">Mixu's unlocker</a> to use it.</p>

<p>We're still awaiting the reveal of the final official faction set to join Norsca and Slaanesh for the next DLC, Tides Of Torment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">The current favourite is the high elves</a>, specifically naval commander Sea Lord Aislinn. Preferably with massive <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/high-elf-realms-merwyrm-2025">Merwyrms</a> in tow, mainly so I can shout "That's not your wyrm, it's Merwrym!" at my stunned and jealous enemies. The reveal should be coming next month.</p>
<p>There's also a good chance we'll be hearing some news about the fabled Total Warty Thousand by the end of the year, say I. Although even if that doesn't end up happening, Creative Assembly have announced the announcement, announcedly, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">new Total War games this December</a> as part of an anniversary showcase. I crab not wait. Pincer me, I'm dreaming. It's Lobster get excited about. I shell go sit in the corner and think about what I've done now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-entire-crab-army-comes-to-total-war-warhammer-3-in-the-crustacean-nation-mod]]></content:encoded>
