            <p>
TimeSplitters is one of those weird series that I look back on quite fondly despite never having owned a single one of the games as a wistful youth. I think I've got one kicking around somewhere these days, but back then the only way I would play it was at a friend's house, us messing about, not doing a very good job at co-op in the main story, me failing to beat my friend in multiplayer because I was crap at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> games. And now, here we are, with a fanmade rework that's been 13 years in the making finally released, offering unto me a chance to relish in some nostalgia, but New.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a> before, it's a fan project that's sort of a remake, sort of a best of compilation of the various games' maps, modes, challenges, and story bits. As the website puts it, it's "not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title."

<p>
Admittedly I do think the project has that look about it that many remakes do, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> remakes for example, where in an effort to look modern, they lose a bit of atmosphere. At the same time, I like how crunchy the gameplay looks. Punchy shooting, punchy punches, a lot of goofiness about it that you'd expect from such a series. Plus it does deserve some commendation for actually existing as a thing you can just have for free. And the team did apologise for the wait too on the game's website; "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever."
</p><p>
It should be noted that this is just an early access release, so don't expect it to be feature complete just yet. There's a bunch of maps and arcade modes, a whole load of weapons and challenges, and you can play the entirety of the first game in co-op as it stands. It looks real neat honestly! And if you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">head to its website</a> to download the early access release.
