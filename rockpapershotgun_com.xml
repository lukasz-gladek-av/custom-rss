            <p>
Let's get something real clear here right off the bat: I couldn't possibly tell you if Team Cherry are planning to make any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> games. That isn't to say there isn't more Hollow Knight on the way, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be getting… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">something</a>, at some point, in the future. However! Studio heads William Pellen and Ari Gibson have at least floated a hypothetical idea around how the world of Hollow Knight might get bigger.
</p>
<p>
Remember when ACMI (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) put on a little exhibition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">where there was a playable demo for Silksong</a> earlier this year? Well, as shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar</a>, that same exhibition came with a <a href="https://shop.acmi.net.au/collections/frontpage/products/acmi-guide-hollow-knight-silk-song-softcover">little guidebook</a> filled with concept art, maps, as well as an interview with Team Cherry.
</p>
<p>
Pellen and Gibson were asked by co-curator of the exhibition Jini Maxwell how they might define success for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, both noting that "releasing it with no major bugs" would be a good start. "The 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," Pellen explained. "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."
</p>
<p>
Gibson added on to that saying that said goal was to make Silksong a "game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight," one that "kind of branches off in a nice way; I think they really complement each other." Here's where the interesting bit comes in from Gibson: "I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong. And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern - that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."
</p><p>
Ahah! There it is! The quote that will convince the masses that more Hollow Knight games are in the works. Of course, again, there's no way of knowing this. Still, this comment reassures me. I'm glad that Silksong is mostly a self-contained experience separate from the original Hollow Knight, and if this world has to be explored again, it should once more do its own thing. Wouldn't mind it if Sherma showed up elsewhere, though.

            <p>
I think miHoYo might just have a bit too much money. Somehow, they have yet another game on the way called Varsapura, yet another anime-looking, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> action game, this time by way of psychic mishappenings. As many have pointed out, there's a vague Control-like quality to it, at least in its newly shown off, lengthy gameplay demo.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere and vibes are admittedly quite strong, miHoYo has always been fairly good at that. Within the gameplay demo, a fancy, government-esque building twists and reshapes itself into something surreal and abstract, enemies that look like office workers turned into shadowy monsters.

<p>
Narratively, this is all explained thusly: the titular Varsapura is a strange space that can be entered, with the protagonist's appearance shifting "to match each viewer’s preferences. The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown." There's an organisation called SEAL, or Shadow Emergency Alliance, with the player character showing up at their main office (the aforementioned government building), in a particularly Control-like intro.
</p><p>
Then there's the combat, which honestly, once you've played one miHoYo game you've played them all. It's all flashily animated combos that let you switch between different characters with what appears to be not much substance. Don't get me wrong, fun to look at, there's just a similar aura to those videos of singing bits of fruit and vegetables that are rotting babies' brains. Also I wish they'd let the psychic cop women wear pants, it doesn't seem like the kind of work they're doing really calls for a miniskirt.
</p>
<p>
Overall there's still not much known about Varsapura, outside of the fact it's releasing on PC. You'll just have to keep an eye out on a release date in the meantime.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a bit of a rough go of it, given how it's been in the works for a decade, still isn't finished, and was unceremoniously cancelled. Not to worry though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">as it's back</a>! And it's in the hands of its developer's original co-founders. With the announcement that Hytale will live on, it was also noted that the game's pricing would be revealed soon, and soon it was as it's already been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
As shared on Hytale's own Sitter account, the game will be a simple $20, with the option to pay a bit more if you fancy helping out the devs that little bit extra. There's two higher tiers, the first being Supporter at $35, and the Cursebreaker Founders Pack at $70, both of which will include cosmetics like "capes, hats, and more." Now, admittedly you might be thinking that $20 sounds quite low, something Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme agrees with.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you wish to support the team and Hytale’s development, we will be offering a Supporter and Founders pack that offers cosmetics like capes, hats, and more. <a href="https://t.co/K5q909tixp">pic.twitter.com/K5q909tixp</a></p>— Hytale (@Hytale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hytale/status/1991884608770855233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
"I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781">wrote on his own Witter account</a>. "I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note that because the game is currently unfinished and is running on a build that's four years old, pricing it any higher wouldn't have felt right. He even went as far as saying that he doesn't "think the game is good yet." In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992193367417971115">follow-up post</a> he doubled down on this saying he "genuinely" means it.
</p><p>
He explained that he's "confident it's going to be 'ok' for release," but a mixture of bug issues, a lack of progression mechanics configured, and generally missing features means it won't be as good as it could be. But he did end on a positive note, at least: "I will do my best to empower my team to make a great game, however long it takes."
</p>
<p>
If you fancy taking a look at how the game is shaping up pretty much right this very second, you can check out some gameplay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">right here</a>.

It's been 10 years since Fatshark's Warhammer Tide years kicked off, starting with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide">Warhammer: End times - Vermintide</a>, and to celebrate that anniversary the developer has been offering up various in-game events and updates in both Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Earlier this week <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> received a free new level, a point we'll come back to, but the big thing you should know first is that you can pick up the co-op dark fantasy game for free on Steam right now, and keep it forever.
</p>
<p>
Literally all you need to do is head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/">Steam page</a>, and add it to your library. Easy as pie, cheap as chips! Or cheaper than chips, I suppose. As a word of warning, don't dilly dally on picking it up if you are interested in checking out the game. The offer is only running until November 24th, in a couple of days time, according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/600795607306601669?l=english">Steam blog post</a>, so best get on it right away.

Anyway, that new level! It's called Return to the Reik, and it's already available to pick up, again completely for free. This one should be familiar to those that have played the first Vermintide, as it originally featured in that game. In the Vermintide 2, River Reik now apparently has "expanded, boat‑focused gameplay." As you can see in the above trailer, that does involve some boat on boat shenanigans, complete with the game's usual combat. Looks pretty neat!

There were a few fixes, tweaks, and features added in with this new level too, which you can read about in this other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546748595947175982">Steam blog post</a>. Happy vermintiding!
