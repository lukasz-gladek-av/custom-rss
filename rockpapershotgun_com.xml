            <p>For months, I’ve been keeping an eye out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack!</a>, an enticingly loud stunt-action game that’s somewhere between an autorunner and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, if Tony Hawk was an electric locomotive and not a man of mortal flesh. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">played it last year</a> and was instantly smitten with its speedy, tricksy rail riding, and now that there’s a newly released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">Steam demo</a>, perhaps you will be too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve had a go, and while the playable story bits – in which your unsatisfied ramen delivery girl embarks on a career of competitive train flipping – are still enjoyably breakneck, there’s also a purely stunt-focused score attack mode that’s given me a fresh appreciation for the depth of Denshattack!!’s tricks system.</p>
<p>In contrast to these opening campaign stages, where you learn the basics of jumping and twisting your carriage on linear A-to-B runs, this mode is a looping maze of grindrails, halfpipes, and rideable walls. Both a proving ground and training facility, which is useful, because most of the aerial tricks in Denshattack!!! demand such complex yet precise flicks of the gamepad’s right stick that I’m not certain all of them are possible without undergoing some manner of cybernetic thumb joint surgery.</p>



<p>It’s good fun, though, thrashing a fat, blocky engine around like with such pace and aplomb that it almost starts to look graceful. It still feels like the campaign is the place to go for big, silly set pieces and an even greater sense of barely-holding-together speed, where tricks are mostly grabbed in the brief windows where you’re not dodging track hazards, or barrelling along atop a commandeered Ferris wheel. But there’s something more quintessentially Hawkian about the score attack mode, and it’s not just the animal brain desire to make a bigger number on the next run than the last one.</p><p>There’s a real mastery to be pursued here, I reckon. One measured less in combo multipliers and more in the physical spectacle of perfectly timed 720s, or grinds so clean they wouldn’t nudge the bubble on a spirit level. Pure athleticism, if you don’t count the traction motor.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Denshattack!!!! demo is out now. There’s still no word of a release date beyond "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-pacific-drive-dlc-boltgun-2-trailer-denshattack-release-window-and-solasta-ii-early-access-update">Spring 2026</a>," as far as I can tell, so hopefully it doesn’t get the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">Steam Machine treatment</a>. In the meantime, you can also read Malindy Hetfeld’s chat with David Jaumandreu, studio director at developers Undercoders, about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-game-developers-worldwide-are-reliving-y2k-japan-from-jet-set-radio-to-dance-dance-revolution">influences from rhythm games and Japanese rail transit</a>.</p>

            <p>The next big update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Shadow and Order, has been delayed as it undergoes a substantial round of tweakage and expansion. Such a substantial round of tweakage and expansion, in fact, that it'll no longer be called Shadow and Order when it returns.</p>

<p>"This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed," Bungie wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/destinythegame.bungie.net/post/3mf63bvtcms2g">their post</a> announcing the delay.

            <p>

Former staff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games have revealed to RPS that they’re owed months of unpaid salary, following layoffs at the company last year. They've shared an inside look at a troubled independent studio dealing with payment delays, multiple changes of direction, and general confusion that stretches back to spring 2025.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded in September 2019, Jyamma are one of Italy’s better-known indies. Based in Milan, they worked on several mobile games before breaking into PC and console development with Enotria, released in September 2024. We liked Enotria, a sunny and theatrical action-RPG with a distinct vocabulary of elements and status effects, set in a world of gorgeously distorted Italian folklore. RPS reviewer Caelyn Ellis <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review">deemed it</a> “a delightful Soulslike palette cleanser to chase down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> with”. 
</p>
<p>
According to former workers who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, Jyamma were working on a sequel to The Last Song when the salary payment delays began over March and April 2025. At the time, staff were told the situation would be resolved quickly. 
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Jyamma Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In April, however, CEO Giacomo Greco put the Enotria sequel on hold. Instead, he announced plans for a trading card game adaptation of Dante Alighieri’s epic poem La Divina Comedia, aka The Divine Comedy - an exciting prospect, following Enotria’s explorations of Italian art and culture. Then, in May, Greco revealed to the rest of the studio in an email that Jyamma was experiencing financial difficulties, and would not be able to proceed with scheduled payments.
</p><p>
In a copy of the email to staff, shared with RPS, Greco attributed Jyamma’s cashflow problems to delayed collection of revenue from sales of Enotria on PlayStation across February, March and April. The company had already faced challenges bringing the game to Xbox Series X and S versions, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/souslike-enotria-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-because-microsoft-decided-to-ignore-devs">promising</a> to "improve our processes" after Greco criticised them on Jyamma’s Discord.
</p>
<p>
The May email to staff stresses that "these issues are specifically related to the last couple of months," and mentions a forthcoming injection of cash from a government tax credit "within a couple of months." There is also talk of "several initiatives to attract private investments through a dedicated platform, which will allow us to diversify our funding sources and ensure greater long-term stability."
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
According to a copy of another email shared with us, this time written by administrative manager Anastasia Tsybakova on June 13th, outstanding payments for April had been "fully paid." But sources tell me that Jyamma management repeatedly postponed monthly payments through to August 2025, with one person commenting that "communication became inconsistent and unclear."
</p><p>
According to my sources, Greco announced another massive change of direction in July: the Divine Comedy adaptation would now be an action-RPG, like Enotria. Greco also told staff that Jyamma were in talks with Neowiz about potential funding. In another email sent to staff in July, he wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> publishers had "expressed strong interest" in publishing either the Divine Comedy adaptation or Enotria 2, with "concrete updates" expected by September or October. 
</p>
<p>
The email also mentions discussions with investors about taking Jyamma public on the NASDAQ stock exchange – "a complex process that could take 6-12 months." In the event of Jyamma going public, the email suggests that Jyamma might “explore” distributing company shares to team members with stock benefits options. Finally, the email touches on some "long-term strategic opportunities" in the shape of very early discussions with Amazon and Tencent.

<p>
There is some existing public corroboration for the reports of delayed payments. Shortly after Jyamma <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">screened a trailer</a> for their Divine Comedy game at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2025, Italian streamers Blur and IlMasseo <a href="https://www.drcommodore.it/2025/08/26/jyamma-games-blur-ilmasseo-polemiche/">published allegations</a> that the studio still owed them payments for promotion of Enotria: The Last Song the previous year.
</p><p>
Things came to a head in October. According to sources, salaries for July were finally paid. Greco also announced that the studio would develop a 2.5D Enotria spin-off alongside the Divine Comedy game. In an email sent October 1st, he confirmed that Jyamma were "actively engaged in a deal and public listing process" on NASDAQ, to be finalised in "five-six" months. 
</p>
<p>
However, he also revealed plans for mass layoffs "to make the company more sustainable," with the promise to "ramp up again" and discuss rehiring staff once investment had been secured. According to one source, Jyamma made two separate rounds of layoffs in October and December. My sources noted with some bitterness that on the day of the original layoff announcement, Jyamma posted "Happy Birthday to us!" on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jyammagames/reel/DPRy3pACT1q/?hl=en">Instagram</a>.

As of February 9th, sources tell me that some current Jyamma staff are getting paid. But several former team members are apparently still owed salary payments for August, September and October. 
</p>
<p>
It’s a depressing state of affairs for such an outwardly promising studio. Enotria is both a well-made game and a rich contribution to the wider compendium of Soulsliking - in foregrounding Italian folklore, it talks back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> studio FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.killscreen.com/understanding-sublime-architecture-bloodborne/">representations of European culture and architecture</a>. 
</p><p>
I’m similarly enthused by what I’ve seen and read of Jyamma’s Divine Comedy adaptation, in which "dark forces subvert the promises of the poem," hinting at some degree of creative antagonism with the source text. Still, all of that comes second to ensuring that your staff have secure livelihoods.
</p>
<p>Approached for comment about these allegations of delayed payments, together with the reports of changes of project direction and publisher negotiations, Jyamma CEO Giacomo Greco offered the following general response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enotria was an ambitious project, entirely self-financed, self-produced, and self-published, born from the passion of our team and several industry veterans, with the clear objective of establishing Jyamma Games' identity through the development of original IPs rooted in Italian culture.</p>
<p>The company has always acted with the well-being of its collaborators as a priority and has consistently worked to retain as many team members as possible. We confirm that we have never ceased compensating our collaborators. While some payments have been rescheduled, all commitments continue to be honored, as they have been regularly over the past six years. Following a necessary restructuring to ensure long-term sustainability, the current team is fully aligned with the studio's resources, and there are no payment delays.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter involving Italian streamers, Jyamma Games has always honored and will continue to honor all agreements made. The parties involved are working together to ensure that all agreed obligations are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Jyamma Games refrains from commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding projects or partnerships, and any information regarding its initiatives will be shared when appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've contacted Blur and IlMasseo for an update on whether they're still owed any payments by Jyamma.</p>

            <p>In the aftermath of reports claiming that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) deepened their reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement demanding the company cut ties with the agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> are the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">worker-led group</a> who've carried out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">protests</a> against Microsoft's dealings with the Israeli military, amid what Amnesty International and a UN enquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/israel-still-committing-genocide-in-gaza-amnesty-international-says">have called</a> a genocide in Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to reporting from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/ice-microsoft-technology-immigration-crackdown">The Guardian</a> and partner publications <a href="https://www.972mag.com/ice-microsoft-azure-leaked-files/">+972 Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/">Local Call</a> earlier this week, leaked documents indicate that ICE increased the amount of data it stored on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform from from 400 terabytes as of July 2025 to almost 1,400 terabytes as of January 2026. The agency are also reportedly using Microsoft "productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data".</p>
<p>In a statement to The Guardian, a Microsoft spokesperson said that while they do "[provide] cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE" via "key partners", the company's policies and terms of service "do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity".</p><p>Following this reporting, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsofts-ties-with-ice-come-under-fire-amidst-allegations-that-the-companys-cloud-and-ai-technology-are-being-used-to-support-mass-surveillance-of-us-citizens/">PC Gamer</a>. "No Azure for Apartheid recognizes that the same Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI technology that forms the technological backbone of Israel's apartheid and genocide is the same technology that powers ICE's violence towards migrants and communities in the United States," the group wrote.</p>
<p>"We, as Microsoft workers, stand in solidarity both with Palestinians and the communities and families in the United States who are being terrorized, detained, murdered, and deported by ICE," they continued. "We echo the demands of hundreds of workers and community members who spoke out as early as 2018 to demand Microsoft cut ties with ICE."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly revoked the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">in September last year</a>, following reporting that this tech was being used for surveilance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
