<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> has had a few crossovers in its time since releasing in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-indie-megahits-combine-in-vampire-survivors-among-us-dlc-out-later-this-month">like with Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-is-getting-guns-in-a-new-contra-crossover-gun-focused-dlc-called-operation-guns">Contra of all series</a>, and the one that felt like an inevitability, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-to-get-its-biggest-dlc-yet-an-ode-to-castlevania-with-a-sprawling-new-map">Castlevania</a>. The game's latest collab was just announced at this year's Triple-I showcase, and personally it's a bit of a head scratcher: Square Enix's SaGa series. Referred to as the Emerald Diorama update, specifically because of the most recent entry in the series Emerald Beyond, it was introduced with another lovely animated segment showing off a magical catgirl and a battery-looking robot.

I'm sure they'll mean something to someone, I've never seen them in my life, but I have fallen in love with them immediately. In terms of new gameplay stuff, this was kept pretty brief, but to summarise, there's 40+ new attacks, 16+ new characters and skins, a 7-biome new stage, and glimmer and showstopper mechanics.

On top of that, The Coop Update is dropping with this one. No, not co-op, coop! Last month poncle teased this update with a gif of a pixel art chicken being killed in a lovely looking field, and a press release confirmed that this in fact said chicken-themed update. The press release also made note of the fact that it has nothing to do with the very different local co-op mode the game already has, and that poncle are still working on online co-op. Lastly, there's a couple of new adventures, one for the base game, one for the Foscari DLC.
</p>
<p>
If you want more details, unfortunately I don't have them, but it's a free update, and it's out today! It should be noted that poncle have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/529839807839340229?l=english">previously said</a> that this update has delayed some other additions, so if there's something you're expecting, don't fret if it's not there. The developer also noted at the time that cross save progress will be coming with this update, so if you own something other than a PC, you'll be able to switch between platforms now. Neat!

Announced just now at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma - The Frozen Compass</a> is a wintry 3D action adventure in which a tenacious young buck and his dog get stranded on an Arctic island. The key thing to know is that it's a co-op game, a co-op <em>splitscreen</em> game, if you please, which means that you and your friends must decide, right now, which of you will play the dog. 
</p>
<p>
This game is described as "a powerful story of love, loss, and endurance", which doesn't bode brilliantly for the dog, so whoever dons the collar needs to a great tragic actor. I encourage you to spend a few weeks rehearsing the business of lying bloodied in the snow next to a dead yeti, whining heroically at the back of your departing owner, who has decided he's more of a cat person anyway. Come now, let me see your expression of puppy-eyed anguish. There's a nice juicy biscuit in it for you if you can make me cry.

If you don't have a friend willing to be a dog, the good news is that in Ikuma, you can switch between characters in solo play. Caught between realms, at home in neither: the ultimate nightmare. Each character has unique skills with which to conquer different obstacles. The dog ain't so hot at rowing boats, while the human is less competent at fitting through dog-shaped holes.
</p>
<p>
There appear to be elements of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> here, glinting at us menacingly through the ice. "Use the tools and items you gather on the island to find your way and overcome rough terrain," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728620/IKUMA__The_Frozen_Compass/">explains the Steam page</a>. "Climb, fish, gather resources, do what it takes to get yourself and your companion to safety." You also have to worry about ancient Inuit legends, and the mystery of a lost expedition. "Retrace their steps but beware of what's lurking within the fog that cloaks their path," the Steam page cautions. 
</p>
<p>
Fog, eh? That sounds like the kind of clinging, spectral mist a dog might run barking into, only for the barking to suddenly end in an agonised whimper. How's your abject whimpering? Carnegie Mellon-worthy? Again, you might want to get in some practice. Honestly, I'd love to play the dog but I'm probably going to corpse it and yell something like "oh fuck, a giant werewalrus". 
</p>
<p>
Ikuma - The Frozen Compass will release in 2026. Developers Mooneye Studios are the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/claw-wing-and-swim-through-lost-embers-forgotten-world">Lost Ember</a>, in which you get to play a whole menagerie of critters, from moles to parrots.
