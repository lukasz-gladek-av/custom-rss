            <p>Shhhhh. If we're quiet, we might be able to avoid discourse with this one. If you've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">spent your weekend playing</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and found that the likes of enemies inflicting double damage and spawns being miles away put a dampner on the fun, mods can help. </p>
<p>I know, I know, these are videogames and we must take their difficulty with the utmost seriousness. How else are any of us supposed to learn important life lessons, like 'press button dodge at this point', unless we go through hours of frustration trying to beat one boss (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-and-tricks">look such info up</a>)? As such, I stress that these mods, like all mods, are entirely optional. No need to shout at people for using them. Save your voice for singing love ballads to Hornet during breaks in the action.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right, now I've addressed the very powerful elephant in the room, let's take a gander at Skong's Nexus Mods page, which has filled out nicely now the metroidvania's got a weekend under its belt. Silksong's most endorsed mod thus far is one by Baiker that stops enemies and "normal bosses" from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/16">dishing out double damage</a>, while leaving hazards free to keep on punishing you. Don't look at the comments on it, if you've not got your internet argument observation popcorn handy.</p>
<p>Also up there in both the download and endorsement rankings is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/28">a mod</a> from XiaoHaiNB, which adds health bars and damage numbers to baddies. Probably my favourites so far are the death counters. You've got a choice of two from modders <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/18">Rexxah</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/14">NordboDev</a>, and they'll just sit there on your HUD, reminding you how many times your abilities have proven to be a bit too hollow shite.</p><p>Going back to the easening up, there's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent. As you might expect, this one takes a bit of inspiration from FromSoft's Ancient Hoop by ensuring that "when you die in a scene, you will respawn at the scene entrance instead of at a bench miles away". It also lets you set custom respawn points, which is cool.</p>
<p>For those annoyed by Silksong's insistence on not being able to check where you are on the map at a glance, there's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21">Always Have Compass Effect</a>' by Synthlight, which does what it says on the tin. The same modder's stepped in with a mod that makes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/53">delivery items less fragile</a> than a shipment of unpacked wine glasses precariously balanced to form a 20 foot tall tower and positioned next to some partially lit fireworks.</p>
<p>The final mod that's caught my eye so far is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/25">this one</a> for lore enthusiasts, which ensures you only have to kill a single enemy to be able to read their species' journal entry.</p>
<p>Make sure to check the requirements of each of these if you fancy giving them a go, as most require the likes of <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/">BepInEx</a> and <a href="https://melonloader.co/">MelonLoader</a> to get up and running.</p>

            <p>In good news for those saddened by their inability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFPl27xoxg">stamp on Hitler's head</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are once again making noises about developing a new Wolfenstein game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE">a No-Clip documentary</a> about the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a>, studio head Jerk Gustafsson commented briefly that they still have an outline for a sequel that completes the story of B.J. Blazkowicz.</p>
<p>"That journey for B.J., even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [B.J.], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," the developer observed. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p>
<p>I find the prospect of another major Wolfenstein game from MachineGames... interesting (there have also been several standalone spin-offs - The Old Blood, Youngblood and Cyperpilot, the latter two developed in partnership with Arkane Lyon). Few big budget shooters have courted the thunder of Topicality quite like New Colossus, an alternate-history fable set in a United States that has been conquered by the Nazis.</p><p>Back in 2017, I offered some rather grandiose and theory-drenched Opinions about how New Colossus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-politics">"takes the white dudebro hero apart"</a>, following the election of Donald Trump. Hunter Pauli <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/b-j-blazkowicz-and-the-shallow-diversity-of-games">wrote a great rebuttal</a>, commenting that "for a series built around the deconstruction of Aryan bodies, it's taken a long time for players to take the hint that Wolfenstein's ubermensch William Blazkowicz is Jewish."</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but 2017 feels like a billion years ago to me. Since then, Trump has won a second term and initiated a bunch of crackpot and draconian measures against migrants and marginalised people. Russia have invaded Ukraine in what has become the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. Israel are shelling and starving hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza with the US government's backing - an invasion that has contributed to a crisis of legitimacy in the USA and UK, where elites characterise support for Palestinians as terrorism.</p>
<p>I do not envy any Wolfenstein writer trying to make something approximating a mainstream commercial first-person shooter that alludes to any of this. But then again, there is no such thing as "a simpler time".</p>
<p>In terms of the business of games development, the ground has also shifted considerably beneath MachineGames' feet. They're now owned by Microsoft, via the latter's purchase of ZeniMax Media. Microsoft, of course, are on something of a cost-cutting spree. As reported by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106506/machinegames-financials-reveals-indiana-jones-developer-has-6-profit-margin/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook">Tweaktown</a>, MachineGames made <a href="https://www.allabolag.se/bokslut/machinegames-sweden-ab/uppsala/datautveckling-systemutveckling-programutveckling/2K34T6JI5YDOJ">a small profit in 2024</a>, but that means nothing without understanding how it fits into the parent company's wider fortunes. MachineGames have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wolfenstein-machinegames-cancelled-unannounced/">cancelled at least one unannounced game between 2022 and 2024</a>.</p><p>Microsoft, meanwhile, stand accused of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">abetting the genocide in Gaza while quelling internal criticism of their business links to Israel</a>. A number of ZeniMax staff have signed an <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">open letter</a> calling for Microsoft to divest from the Israeli armed forces.</p>
