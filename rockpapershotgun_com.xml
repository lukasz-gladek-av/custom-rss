            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-the-shire">Tales Of The Shire: A The Lord Of The Rings Game</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cosy-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-needs-more-time-in-the-oven-delayed-until-2025">finally coming out this month</a>, offering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-is-so-jolly-and-joyful-it-creeps-the-hell-out-of-me">terrifyingly cosy Hobbitiness</a> to us bumbling Bilbos. Its system requirements have just dropped, and they're pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, its needs are so modest and homely that I'm wondering whether you might be able to run it <em>on</em> a Hobbit, provided you could find one in real life and staple some Nvidia - or AMD- branded plastic into the surface of its flesh. It's ok, I'm sure Gandalf has a magic stapler that doesn't produce excruciating pain if you fire it directly into a person.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, donning our spec-inspecting specs, let's take a look at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/">Steam page</a>. Tales of the Shire's minimum system requirements, which promise 30fps on very low settings, comprise the following: an Intel Core i5-7600K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, 16GB of RAM, 3GB of storage space on a hard drive or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> running at least Windows 10, and your choice of an Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, an AMD Radeon R9 270X, or an Intel Arc A580.</p>
<p>Those Nvidia and AMD GPUs are both from 2013, so while you'll need a decent CPU, there's some nice older rig potential for those who aren't down to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">splash the cash on an RTX 5090</a> just to play a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-s3-episode-16-the-new-hobbit-life-sim-and-our-favourite-the-lord-of-the-rings-games">Hobbity life sim</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recomended specs - which should net you 60fps on high settings - list Intel Core i5-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 8400F processors, 16GB of RAM, 3GB of drive space, Windows 11, and either an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT.</p>
<p>Nice, but can it run on a Hobbit? Hear me out. You install the game in his head through hypnotic suggestion, his mouth makes all the noises, and the visuals are projected onto his eyes through forbidden rendering magic, turning them into dual monitors. There's a graphics card from just over a decade ago grafted onto his buttocks, and a DisplayPort cable runs from it up into his ear. He averages a solid 20fps because he occasionally has to blink, and you use his nipples like the analogue sticks of a controller and bop his nose every time you need to press Enter.</p>
<p>In the distance, Sauron sees what you're up to, and is so horrified he considers giving the Middle-earth cops a spare ring and your address.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-the-shires-system-requirements-have-me-considering-grafting-a-graphics-card-to-a-hobbits-bum]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. This one's patch 01.003.200, and it brings the latest in pointy flag tip technology, in addition to another round of weapon balancing. You'll need that flag stabbiness too, as the latest Galactic War twist has seen the Automatons try to wrestle control of Super Earth's space station.</p>
<p>Yep, stop trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">rename a city 'Gun'</a> for five minutes, some stuff's going down in HD2 that you need to be clued in on, even if its just so you can run around the room cheering at how much more effective your Flame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sentry">Sentry</a>'ll now be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As has become the standard for Helldivers 2 updates that pass a certain beefiness threshold, patch 01.003.200 has both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/601909716088521243?l=english">notes</a> and a video explainer that sees design director Niklas Malmborg joined by senior designer Patrik 'Fluffy' Lasorta to talk through the changes.</p>
<p>First of all, the devs have slightly reduced the time it takes your diver to get up after ragdolling, as well as boosting chest injury bleed damage because the latter was previously at a level so low that "it appeared to have no effect". There are also a bunch of tweaks to weapons, mainly aimed at boosting how effective stunning, bayonet-induced stagger, and the firestarting capabilities of stuff like the aforementioned Flame Sentry are.</p>

<p>By far the most important change, however, is the following one to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">Masters of Ceremony warbond</a>'s One True Flag stratagem. "Thanks to some groundbreaking military research into pointier flag tips, the flag can now be proudly planted directly into enemies — dead or alive — ensuring the eternal colors of Super Earth are never tainted, only quenched by the blood of its foes," Arrowhead wrote, with Malmborg adding in the video that "a surprising amount of code" needed messing with to pull this off.</p>
<p>Hellpods and enemies have also undergone some tweaks, but I'm now gonna pivot to something far more urgent. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1394621065032106064">fresh Major Order</a> dropped alongside this patch, and it's seeing the Automatons move to secure sites key to the running of the Democracy Space Station - which the divers have been using to help further Super Earth's goals since late last year.</p>
<p>Claorell, Tarsh, and Gaellivare are the planets folks are being tasked with holding to prevent the DSS being destroyed or falling into enemy hands. Arrowhead also notes that "enemy troop movements indicate this is only the first of several planned waves of attack", meaning "additional invasions are anticipated".</p>
<p>So, it looks like defending the floating hunk of metal is gonna be the next big goal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station]]></content:encoded>
