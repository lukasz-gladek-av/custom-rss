            <p>
For as video gamey a series as The Matrix is, it is a touch surprising there have only been a handful of actual games. Obviously the one that makes most sense is The Matrix Online, what other genre but an MMO could The Matrix could be? Well, there's also Enter The Matrix, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-enter-the-matrix">which is basically Max Payne</a>, but you still have to wonder what else could have been. Especially because The Wachowskis literally pitched the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima making a Matrix game directly to Konami.
</p>
<p>
Christopher Bergstresser, the former vice president of licensing at Konami Digital Entertainment, recently spoke with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/no-one-ever-told-me-such-a-conversation-had-taken-place-kojima-wasnt-aware-of-the-wachowskis-matrix-game-offer">Time Extension</a> about this apparent pitch, explaining that "The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima." He explained, "So Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito (who still works with Kojima), and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!"
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
The pair of directors attended the meeting with their visual effects lead, asking if Konami and Kojima would make a Matrix game, to which Kitaue (who went on to become CEO of Konami) apparently plainly said "'No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though." Except, apparently, according to Kojima himself, he wasn't even aware of such a pitch.
</p>
<p>
After word of Time Extension's report went around, Kojima took to his personal English Twitter account to say that he was "surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project!' back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place."
</p><p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> director went on to explain that he does recall having met the Wachowskis three times, and that they had attended Konami's headquarters, but Kojima only showed up after the meeting with Kitaue had taken place. He also remembers attending the Japanese premiere and party, but "even then, there was no mention of an offer."
</p>
<p>
It's this bit that will leave you with thoughts of what could have been: "At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work." Alas, now we'll never know! Which makes me a touch sad, because I would love to live in a world where his hypothetical Matrix game reads your browser history to judge you or something, you know, one of those classic oddball Kojima features.

            <p>
Right, what do we have here, a new game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-florist">The Florist</a>, 'ey? About a woman delivering a beautiful flower arrangement to a lakeside town? Well, surely this is one of those wholesome, cosy games I've been hearing about! Nope! It is, in fact, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, and not the kind that's trying to trick you like I just made a less than half-arsed attempt at.
</p>
<p>
Those opening couple of sentences weren't lies though, it really is about a woman making a flower delivery in a lakeside town (called Joycliffe). It's just that the town is also suffering from some kind of "lethal affliction" that appears to be of the floral variety. The town is covered in plants and petals of all sorts, this infection turning its inhabitants into almost literally green thumb monsters.
</p>
<p>
So far the reveal is just a bit of a tease, but I must admit I'm quite curious about its approach to horror. Nature is scary! Yet the ways this can be explored in films and games can often lean towards an apocalyptic absence of nature. Here, nature is the thing that is becoming dominant, a force that we're normally quick to kill. Horror is often the genre best suited for looking at the ways people interact with the world, so I'm hoping The Florist pulls it off.
</p>
<p>
Details are generally quite limited, but there are a few to be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3152440/The_Florist/">Steam page</a>. The game uses my beloved fixed camera angle, something bigger budget games just seem to be too afraid of using these days. There's puzzles, there's gun-based combat, and perhaps controversially, unlimited inventory space.
</p><p>
Lastly, the world also apparently "grows and changes throughout the game." I think a good survival horror that uses fixed camera angles is one that should force you to get to know a space, so a space that changes and becomes uncertain sounds quite intriguing - if the devs can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
The Florist is currently expected to launch sometime in 2026.

            <p>
Because that sacred line called profit must always go up, we are seeing more and more game studios announce their intention to incorporate various forms of AI tech. PUBG publisher Krafton just recently referred to themselves as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">AI-first company</a>, the big wigs up top at EA are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">reportedly pushing for it hard</a>, it is, seemingly, unfortunately, inevitable. Which makes Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick's comments on it ever so slightly surprising - but only slightly, we'll get back to that.
</p>
<p>
Zelnick made an appearance at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's</a> Technology Executive Council Summit on Tuesday, where he was asked about his thoughts on the "promise" of AI in game development. Right off the bat, the CEO reminds us that he is still the CEO of publicly-traded company, as he did make it clear he's not a "naysayer" of AI. But he does actually seem to understand how limited it currently is, and crucially, for him and Take-Two, how risky it is for their intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
"We have to be really careful not to step on other people's intellectual property, and we don't ours stepped on," Zelnick explained. "As you know, if you create intellectual property with AI, you can't protect it. We're in the intellectual property business, we care about our rights, we care about other people's rights, and we have to protect what we make."
</p>
<p>
That's where the comments aren't very surprising, as it just seems like Zelnick is the very rare CEO that doesn't want to force AI right this very second because it risks their precious IP, IP that includes giants like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a> and NBA, as well as still very popular series like Borderlands.
</p><p>
This is where the surprising element comes in! Zelnick went on to note how in the event that AI has no constraints, he thinks whatever you'd make wouldn't be very good. "Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the ‘<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>’, and the marketing plan, and here it is? The answer is no. A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."
</p>
<p>
Zelnick goes on to say how AI is just big datasets, and defines them as "backward-looking," as in it's always working off of something else that's already been made rather than looking forward. Perhaps his most surprising line is this one: "there is no creativity that can exist, by definition, in any AI model, because it is data driven."
</p>
<p>
I'd like to be very clear that I really do think Zelnick is currently only hesitant about implementing the use of AI at scale because of his aforementioned concerns over IP. I'm just hoping (yes, a useless thing to do here) that maybe some other CEOs and shareholders might see the GTA guys holding off and think maybe we should too. Can't wait for that to not happen!
