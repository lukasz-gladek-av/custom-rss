Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

<p>
Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> shared its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">roadmap for the game</a> across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as "part of the updated Lair Boss system."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an "IP collab." That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature "universes that complement its dark themes." Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab.
</p>
<p>
Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them "evolve in ways that are more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.

            <p>
It's another week, and with that comes word of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update. The patch isn't ready quite yet, but in a new <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/">update check-in</a> post, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/firaxis-games">Firaxis</a> shared that the game's next update is coming April 22nd, just a couple of weeks away. There's a few big changes coming too, so how about we just jump right in. First up is a change to resources. There'll be ten new resources coming to the game, all of which will get their own new narrative events for starters.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Resources will now crop up differently thanks to a "newly added randomized resource generation system." You'll still get key resources in every age, but past that there'll be a wider variety available on the map. Certain resources will also now only be findable on certain continents or hemispheres, with Firaxis hoping that this "gives your maps a little bit more personality and motivation to explore." Treasure resources will also be getting passive effects too.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the changes coming to food. A lot of Civvers (that's what I call Civilization players, I think it's gonna catch on) apparently found that rural population and food wasn't really worth investing in past a certain point, so Firaxis is making some tweaks to make population growth scale "much more smoothly across your campaign, even deep into later Ages. And, growing beyond 8 or 9 rural Population is now very achievable; doing so won’t take hundreds of turns."
</p>
<p>
This update introduces an endless play mode too, so you can keep going with your campaign once you've finished the modern age thanks to a new Just One More Turn option. There's a returning feature from previous Civ games too, Teams Multiplayer, and a bunch of other additions like a repair all option, less natural disasters, and overall quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
Firaxis also took the time to assure us all by promising that previously mentioned features like auto-explore and new map types are still in the works too, they just won't be in this update. In the meantime, just keep Civving (that's a new verb I just made for when you're playing Civilization, I think it's gonna catch on) it up!
