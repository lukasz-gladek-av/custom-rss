The Nintendo Dual Screen! Or Nintendo DS, as it was actually known. There's a console that has practically no relevance to this site, except for right now, because of a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dementium-the-ward">Dementium: The Ward</a>. For those that haven't heard of it, this is one of the incredibly few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games available on the handheld console, nowadays a bit of a cult classic because who on earth thought it would be a good idea to do that. It was also pitched as a Silent Hill game, a point we'll come back to because the big thing here is that it's making its way to Steam later this month.
</p>
<p>
Here's the concept: you wake up in a hospital, you've got no memories, and there's nasty monsters you have to defend yourself from. On the original DS, you had to use the touch screen to look around, and you needed to use the D-Pad to move. This obviously sounds like a bit of a tricky control scheme, though it looks like it'll be your standard first-person affair in the PC release. One thing in the DS' favour that will be missing however is that you could also write down notes in a notebook using the touchscreen.

I do wonder if these changes will rob the game of something. It's not a completely new port, the game is already available on Switch and PS4/PS5, so these changes have already taken place, but I question if the lack of friction from the finicky sounding DS controls makes the experience flatter. Though, I do appreciate that it's generally retained its original visuals. Death to revisionist remasters!
</p><p>
Anyway, that Silent Hill connection! A few years back Jools Watsham, the co-founder of Renegade Kid, developer of Dementium, shared that the studio had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/dementium-the-ward-was-pitched-to-konami-as-a-silent-hill-ds-game">pitched the game to Konami about making it a Silent Hill entry</a>. According to Watsham, Konami were "kind enough to meet with us, but the meeting only lasted a few minutes and ended with their [representative] saying they wouldn't let a team like us handle the Silent Hill license." Rough! But looking at Dementium, even if it is a cult classic, it's probably for the best ultimately.
</p>
<p>
Mostly I think this thing is a neat little curiosity, as it's not very often you see DS games ported off of the console given the complexity of adapting dual screen gameplay. Normally you get remakes like The World Ends With You. In any case, if you're interested in picking up the seasonally appropriate Dementium: The Ward, it's due out later this month on October 27th via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3909960/Dementium_The_Ward/">Steam</a>.

            <p>
There should have been two major extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> launching in the last quarter of this year. One of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which is in fact coming out later this month. The other is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">you know</a>. Interestingly, though, with both games hosting tests earlier in the year, there was an opportunity for Arc Raiders' developers to learn something from Marathon.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said how it was "very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."
</p>
<p>
In particular, Watkins notes how the Arc Raiders team was able to gauge how people responded to the pair of extraction shooters' differing takes on the genre. "[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he explained.
</p>
<p>
It is worth pointing out that Watkins said he hasn't been deeply inspecting the game or anything, only a select few have been able to play Marathon. Bungie's shooter is obviously in troubled waters currently, but Watkins is curious to see what becomes of it, saying he "[found] the art style very evocative … I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."
</p><p>
Arc Raiders held its final playtest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">over the weekend</a> and it seems to have gone quite well, so I myself am curious to see whether the full release will be the one to bring extraction shooters out of its deep niche well. Marathon is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">set to hold another test this week</a>, but this one is under NDA, so don't necessarily expect to hear anything about it (even if you can probably bet on someone breaking said NDA for Reddit karma or whatever the kids are into these days).
