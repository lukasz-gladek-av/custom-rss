            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> might have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">launched buggier</a> than a holiday at a nature reserve dedicated to cockroaches and coders, but since that point Team FOLON’s put a lot of effort into making sure people can enjoy the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">pretty damn good game</a> it’s created. While you’ll have to wait a bit longer for some Londony DLC, you can now play some of the mod in VR.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/747?tab=description">Fallout: London VR mod</a> is available to grab right now in beta form via Nexus Mods, having been developed by a team led by modder Asciimov. So, it hasn’t come from Team FOLON directly. That said, Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter has shouted it out via an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1377617569514782831">Team FOLON’s Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>“Please note that this is a community-made and unofficial mod by Asciimov's  ‘Fallout: London VR’ modding team,” Carter wrote, “Team FOLON does not provide any support for this.</p>
<p>“This mod and its conversation system are still in beta, as only around 10% of the quests (one main storyline) have currently been tested, but at the moment all known game breaking bugs have been fixed.” So, you can at least get started with your virtual reality trip to the city of baked beans, bowler hats, and blokes who sound like Michael Caine.</p>
<p>Carter also headed any questions folks might have about the Fallout: London DLC that Team FOLON’s <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">working on</a> off at the pass, adding: “If you are expecting us to announce the DLCs, they are still in the works and coming soon.” Cool.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the Fallout: London VR mod a go, the list of requirements is on its Nexus Mods page. You’ll need <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> with all DLC, Mod Organiser 2, Fallout 4 Script Extender VR version 0.6.21, and - unsurprisingly - Fallout: London. The Fallout: London VR team also has its own <a href="https://discord.gg/7xCQMU8CJ2">Discord server</a> you can head to for help troubleshooting issues that don’t have potential fixes outlined already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
