<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teardown">Teardown</a> is one of those games that's just fun to look at, with all of its completely destructible voxel environments. When it first got announced it kind of reminded me of those old Flash games where you had simple creatures you could shake around and chuck stuff at, the joy of it being to see how far you could push things.</p>
<p>Messing around like that is all the better with friends though, I reckon, and would you look at that, developer Tuxedo Labs have just announced today that a multiplayer update is on the way to the sandbox game.
</p>

<p>
As shared in a press release, it's not just a simple matter of being able to bust up buildings to you and your friends' hearts' content, as there'll be campaign co-op, competitive, and sandbox modes in what's described as the game's "largest update" yet. All you have to do is check the Teardown subreddit to see how highly requested a feature multiplayer is. There was even a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeardownGame/comments/rsbf1v/teardown_multiplayer_has_been_released/">multiplayer mod released a few years back</a>, so this will be welcome news I'm sure.

The multiplayer update will launch initially through the game's Experimental Branch on Steam, and the team will be looking for feedback. Modders might be especially inclined to give it a go, as additions to Teardown's API are planned for around the same time to help people update existing mods to work in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date in sight for the multiplayer update, not even a release window, just a promise that it's "coming later this year." Teardown's been on my list to pick up pretty much since it came out, just one of those games that got away from me, but the opportunity to cause a little bit of destructive mischief with some friends sounds pretty appealing right now.

I'm often put off by gimmicky horror games, but sometimes I see one and think "yeah, that'll be a laugh." This time around it's Eyes Never Wake, the debut survival horror from developer Allan Hedlund. Where some horror games in recent years have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shout-your-dogs-name-into-your-microphone-to-find-him-in-this-horror-game">used your microphone to track how loud you're being</a>, Eyes Never Wake uses your webcam to track whether your face is present or not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Eyes Never Wake, the monster that's trying to hunt you down can't see you if your face isn't visible on screen. The trailer quite cleverly shows this by smoothly cutting from gameplay to real world footage of the player ducking down to hide from the incoming threat.

<p>
It's quite obvious the game takes some cues from modern creepypastas like The Backrooms, and I think the monster design itself is a bit generically naff, but I do think the idea of slamming my head into my desk just to avoid being spotted is pretty funny. It's sort of like an evil but less emotionally devastating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-story-game-is-controlled-by-blinking-into-your-webcam">Before Your Eyes</a>.
</p>
<p>
You might ask "can I not just turn my webcam away so the monster can never see me", to which the game answers, "no, because there are doors that require in-world facial recognition scans in order to open them" - and it <em>also</em> uses your microphone, so it might hear you anyway. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer doesn't reveal much about what Eyes Never Wake involves beyond the cam-ducking idea, so I can only hope it also has things like well-designed layouts and decent pacing. Mostly, though, I'm just excited by a dev playing with the medium while considering the real, physical presence of a player.
</p>
<p>
No word on a release date, but if you're into this game that YouTubers like Markiplier are guaranteed to play, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526200/Eyes_Never_Wake/">wishlist it here</a>.
