            <p>What would do, oh what would you do?</p>
<p>Yes, what would <em>you</em> do, with an infinite shoe?</p>
<p>Would you melt it to make yourself infinite glue?</p>
<p>Or to infinite dogs 'pon which to infinitely chew?</p>
<p>Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I'm very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me <em>rhyming cancer</em>. Also, the urge to browse the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> mods, to see what players of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> were downloading most at the moment. I find there's usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/popularalltime?nav=1&amp;page_size=15&amp;page=2">Nexus Mods page</a> where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game <em>in theory</em>, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.</p>

<p>The two most popular mods are currently one for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14">infinite saving</a> (see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ware-ye-this-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-crash-bug-that-cost-me-hours-of-progress">Edwin's experience for frustrating context</a>) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/32">instant herb picking</a> ("We all know how good Henry is at his leg day game, but we’ve seen this animation enough times"). Right next to that are mods to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59">stay clean for longer</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/63">carry more stuff</a>. Less pesky simulation, basically, and very similar to the most popular mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance?tab=popular+%28all+time%29">for the first game</a>. A bit further down is my favourite one though, tied closely with this "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/12">totally unnecessary reticle for bows and crossbows</a>".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/125">Infinite shoe durability</a> does what it says on the shoebox - disabling the wear and tear Henry accumulates on his footwear while gallivanting around the Bohemian wilderness, and so eliminating the need to replace or repair his favourite pair. To me, this is both a little baffling (again, surely you play a game like KC:D II for this kind of frictive minutiae), but also very funny, simply because I find the idea of infinite shoes very funny.</p>
<p>So, this is a call out. The first person to mod a quest into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> II where Henry meets the fabled Infinite Cobbler gets my kingdom, my horse, and one pair of my actual, finite shoes. There wasn't a massive quest modding scene for the first game, mind. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/1101">The Cuman War mod</a> allowed you to fight repeatable battles all over the map, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/958">Architect mod</a> added base-building features, but otherwise the modding tools available don't seem to have been conducive to something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s many fan-made stories. Ah well, we'll always have those shoes at least.</p>
<p>"Warhorse's historical open world RPG makes Elder Scrolls feel shallow," wrote Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">in his review</a>, "but its deft feudal portrayal is checked by the routine boy's fable at its core".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Comicbook mulchfest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> once planned to reset player ranks twice per season, but these recently-hatched plots are no more, for the gamers have descended upon NetEase like rogue Iron Man suits, and the developers have acquiesced to their verbal kicks and punches.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Yesterday, NetEase <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">announced</a> that they would reset player ranks on 21st February to inaugurate the second half of the hero shooter's first season. The idea was to "shake up the battlefield" alongside the arrival of new characters The Thing and Human Torch plus some "major balance adjustments". Specifically, players were told to expect a rank drop of four divisions, in order that they might rank-up afresh to unlock new rewards such as costumes and crests.
</p>
<p>
"After careful observations and consideration, we have concluded that players' ranks during the first half of Season 1 are the best indicator of their competitive skills within the season," the devs wrote. "So, we will be introducing additional rank reset to better align with the upcoming content and changes!"
</p>
<p>
That jovial exclamation mark was a provocation too far. Like wrathful yet relatively articulate Hulks, the players took to their keyboards and filled social media and Reddit with their outrage. I don't truck much with Marvel Rivals at the minute but I can understand the complaints: imposing rank resets at this frequency forces players to pump in more time to earn the game's digital trinkets. It feels like a cheap and dirty way of driving up Engagement, the worst Marvel supervillain of all.
</p>
<p>
NetEase have heard the cries of the faithful, and are rolling back the changes. "After the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community," reads a conciliatory note, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">issued today</a>. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable." 
</p>
<p>
 As such, there will no longer be a rank reset when the second half of season 1 begins on 21st February. If you're already max rank and you want to earn rewards in the remainder of season 1, you'll simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet "the relevant conditions".
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals remains popular despite these fan skirmishes. It's 7th on the Steam Most Played chart at the time of writing, vying with hardy perennials <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and the Wallpaper Engine for its place in the top 10. I haven't played not so much for lack of enjoyment but because the last time I did the chibi shark kept eating me, and I felt bad about myself.
