            <p>What's this? A game with big robots smashing each other to tiny little pieces above a large sci-fi cityscape, and we have <em>not</em> yet covered it. For shame. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play multiplayer robo-battler in which you fly around and wreck online foes at speeds no mere human should ever be exposed to, and it now has a release date, as announced in a flashy trailer at the Summer Game Fest. I have no idea if playing this will be as intense as the visual heart attack it looks to be. But maybe when it comes out next month I'll try it out. </p>

<p>It's due out on July 2nd. Mecha Break is set on our planet, post-catastrophe, where a shadowy organisation called, uh, S.H.A.D.O.W. have hired you as a pilot and cannonfodder in a grand and doubtless unending war. </p>
<p>"Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/">the Steam page</a>. "Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter." </p>
<p>Why that's basically all the flavours of live service you could possibly want, squished into one game. I don't know whether to be worried or impressed.</p>
<p>The shame I feel for not having covered Mecha Break thus far is only half a joke. Institutionally speaking, RPS has long welcomed the giant robots and robotic suits that smoke with the embers of battle. Whether that's the greeble and grit of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawken">Hawken</a>, the fearful mechmommies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a>, or the cocaine-infused mechamurder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycho-patrol-r">Psycho Patrol R</a>. I do love a big robot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The makers of the Yakuza games have revealed the title of the historical brawler they teased at last year's Game Awards, then known as "Project Century". The full name is Stranger Than Heaven, as unveiled at the Summer Game Fest. It's got a new trailer set in a smokey 1943, in which we meet the game's protagonist, and nod approvingly as he smashes a nose or two.</p>

<p>Nice fedora. The character we follow looks to be detectiving a bit. Knocking on doors and inspecting a cigarettes which will "draw immense hostility" if you choose to smoke them. Disgusting habit. The player also gets a petrol bomb thrown at them, they dodge a bullet, they throw a man off a bridge. Just everyday hijinks they got up to last century, those lovable scamps.</p>
<p>Although this sample of fighting goons and clearing out alleyways is set in wartime Japan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-makers-of-yakuza-are-working-on-project-century-a-new-third-person-brawler-set-in-1915">the previous trailer</a> was set in 1915. That means there's some jumping around in history going on. It'll be intersting to see what's going on here. An intergenerational story of fmaily, betrayal and redemption that'll span the entire 20th century? I'm not saying that's what's definitely going on - just speculatising - but if anyone can do that, the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio probably can.</p>
<p>Ah, but will it be on PC? Probably, although Sega aren't telling us how or when. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
