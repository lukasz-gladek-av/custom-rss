            <p>One of my biggest challenges as a writer has been tempering my love of vague gestures at metaphysical concepts with the revelation that the people who read my articles also, apparently, can’t read my mind. Pah. A skill issue if I ever saw one, honestly. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/decade">Decade</a> is a fascinating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> that drew me in with its apparent vagueness but then, like some sort of considerate, sensible coward, went on to explain itself well in on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3272360/Decade/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the world, and you’re not too happy about it, so you’ll be shoving children in a time machine with little more than a rotting Lunchly and some instructions to help you figure out exactly what went wrong.</p>
<p>What are you dressing as for Halloween? Me, I’m dressing as someone trying to bring back “tray-tray” in an effort to give Edwin a seizure. Here’s the tray-tray:</p>

<p>“Decade is a narrative point-and-click adventure game where you will send children back into the past - ten years at a time - to learn how the world ended, and what you can do to change it,” reads the Steam page. “Investigate documents, technologies, and artefacts to understand history, manage the children and their abilities as they age dramatically, and try to make the right decisions as you create multiple futures that you can venture into.”</p><p>“The world is dead. A metal rain has battered the earth into a pulp, making life unsustainable, “ it continues. “You were twelve when you left the crumbling facilities designed to protect the last of humanity. Thirteen when you, and three younger children you managed to protect, the last people alive, found safety in a sophisticated bunker. Now you're seventeen. This bunker won't protect you forever, but it does contain a time machine that you now know how to use.”</p>
<p>There’s no release date on this one yet, but if you’re up for a weighty, poetic adventure game in the meantime, I don’t think I’ve had the chance to shout about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norco">Norco</a> nearly enough on this website yet. Would “it’s tied with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> as the best written game I’ve ever played” tempt you?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in April, I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/esa-lawyer-frets-about-some-sort-of-terrifying-online-arcade-if-preservation-is-made-easier">a hearing that took place</a> between representatives <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/rhizome">Rhizome project</a>, and the <a href="https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/">Software Preservation Network</a>, in which they argued the case for a DMCA exemption that would allow researchers to remotely access out-of-print games in libraries and archives. Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System">AACS</a> were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish "online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings".</p>
<p>Last Friday, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">as per a statement</a> released by the VGHF and spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/us-copyright-law-forces-researchers-to-explore-extra-legal-methods-for-game-preservation-say-historians-who-are-disappointed-after-being-denied-a-dmca-exemption">PC Gamer</a>, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><em>*Checks our editorial policy on commenting on such matters</em>*. Tossers! Ah well - the VGHF aren’t too fazed, at least.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed by the Copyright Office’s decision, we have no regrets about going through this process," write the VGHF. "Over the last three years, working on the petition has helped us generate important research, notably our Survey of the Video Game Reissue Market in the United States report, which proved that around <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/">87 percent of video games</a> released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print."</p><p>"The game industry’s absolutist position—which the ESA’s own members have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-piracy-fears-are-keeping-some-researchers-from-accessing-the-games-they-need">declined to go on the record to support</a>—forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable," they continue. "We’re not done fighting here. We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues."</p>
<p>"We might be coming full circle back to piracy being something that we need to be literate in, in order to be able to access the things that we love," The VGHF’s Frank Cifaldi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">told me in January</a>. "Digital streaming scooped everything up and we all got content with it. We're already seeing things wiped from existence before our eyes."</p>
<p>Back in May, Warren Spector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-creator-warren-spector-has-literally-dumpster-dived-to-help-with-game-preservation">wrote about how</a> he’d "literally dumpster dived" to help with game preservation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
