The Warhammer Skulls Showcase was full to the brim with, unsurprisingly, lots of Warhammer 40,000 game news, including a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">sequel to Boltgun</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">definitive edition of Dawn of War</a>. CRPG heads were also treated to a reveal of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a new party-based title from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/owlcatgames">Owlcat Games</a>, the devs behind another Warhammer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. The reveal came in the form of a nicely partially 2D-animated trailer alongside some brief looks at gameplay, all of which is looking quite good.

Much like Rogue Trader, Dark Heresy will feature turn-based combat, with this game "set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star." You'll have "intricate investigations" to complete outside of combat, with both those and combat potentially leading to some "grave consequences." Specifically, you'll be an acolyte of the Inquisition, and it'll be up to you to search out for heresy and ultimately decide what happens to the Calixis Sector.

As of now, a release date hasn't been set in stone, not even a release year, so you'll have to hold out for now. I imagine it'll be a while away too, as Owlcat Games are actually still working on Rogue Trader right now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> next expansion, Lex Imperialis, also received a release date reveal of June 24th during the presentation. A second season pass was announced too, revealing two more expansions due out between January and March, and July and September respectively next year.

The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">base game is half-off right now too</a>, if you fancy giving it a punt. Our very own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">reviewed it last year</a>, coming away from it with lots of nice things to say about, as well as a few not so nice things that probably would have been easier to deal with in smaller doses.
