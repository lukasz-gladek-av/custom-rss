            <p>Avast, fellow salty sea-dogs. Some legally-minded landlubbers may have had words with Edward Kenway, captain of The Jackdaw and protagonist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a>. Well, Kenway's voice actor Matt Ryan at any rate, who's been filmed at a convention saying that Ubisoft threatened to sue him over a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">previous video from another convention</a> in which he teased a remake of the game.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, this is the Black Flag remake the publisher haven't confirmed is coming, but has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years.</p>

<p>"I don't know, mate," Ryan said when asked about said remake in this latest instance of a convention goer pointing a phone at him while he signs stuff. "Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [points towards the phone filming this exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. Then the company threatened to sue me. So, [now] I say nothing."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear whether Ryan's unaware he's being filmed this time around, as he does directly acknowledge that the convention goer who's doing so has their phone camera pointed at him. This latest clip was originally uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> and since looks to have been taken down there, but not before it was reposted onto what remains of Twitter.</p> <div>

<p>We've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>It's not nice to hear about anyone allegedly having Lionel Hutzes on their case over something like this, so here's hoping Ryan doesn't end up in any more hot water over this latest clip. If you approach him at a convention with your phone pointed right at his mug in the near future and try to chat Black Flag remakes, I'd expect he might have less to say.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease]]></content:encoded>
