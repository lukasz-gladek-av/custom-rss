            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.
</p>
<p>There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.
</p>

<p>Ubisoft outlined their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/4478361902017151340">approach to stealth in a new blog post</a>, which also includes links out to brief illustrative videos.
</p>
<p>"For the first time in the Assassin's Creed series, hiding in the shadows will make you invisible to enemies. During nighttime, any pocket of shadows becomes a dynamic hiding spot in which you can progress without being seen. This applies to both interiors and exteriors," explains the post. "The ability to use shadows in this way invites you to carefully study your environment for hiding opportunities and routes... or create them yourself by destroying lanterns with a shuriken."
</p>
<p>Likewise, "Naoe and Yasuke are the first protagonists able to go prone in the series." While lying down, you can roll in any direction, crawl under certain buildings, and commit special ankle-based assassination attacks.
</p>
<p>The post mostly focuses on Naoe, one of Shadows' two protagonists, who will carry a smoke bomb, shinobi bells for tossing to distract guards, throwing knives called Kunai, and shuriken which can stun enemies. Yusuke seems to have a similar set of stealth capabilities, but with a different arsenal and some unique wrinkles that will apparently be outlined at a later time.
</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is the return of double assassinations, a one-time iconic feature of the series. "By equipping the Tanto as one of your main weapons and unlocking the dedicated skill, you can eliminate two enemies standing next to each other at once with your Hidden Blade - whether on the ground or from the air," says the post.</p>
<p>The various RPG mechanics of more recent games of the series still remain, however, so it's possible to try to have your attempt denied if you have neglected your "Assassin Hidden Blade upgrades". The assassination prompt will change colour to let you know the outcome in advance: white if it's an instant kill, yellow if you'll deal just some damage, and red if it won't work at all.
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally supposed to come out this year, but was delayed until February 14th, 2025 seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">at staff's urging</a> and in response to somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">lukewarm sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Outlaws continues to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-latest-patch-is-out-and-aims-to-make-stealth-and-combat-more-satisfying">receive patches to improve its own stealth systems post-release</a>.
</p>
<p>I love a good lie down in a video game, so these changes sound appealing to me. I still hate that enemies can out-level a knife, though. My reward for the risk of getting close to an enemy, particularly a strong one, should be the ability to take them out in a single blow - although I realise that other philosophies of stealth may be valid also.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it's rubbish, some others think it's basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it's one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-admits-forced-stealth-sections-are-incredibly-punishing-says-next-patch-will-ease-up-on-them">the forced stealth sections are "incredibly punishing"</a>.
</p>
<p>Now there's a new patch, apparently Outlaws' biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Title update 1.4.0 has several notable changes, but the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">patch notes</a> neatly call them out, so I'm going to quote them here:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Notable updates to stealth and combat that allow players greater choice, including using stealth or reaching for their blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</li>
<li>Enemy AI and detection improvements, with players being notified when they're being detected and can choose to escalate or change tactics to remain in stealth.</li>
<li>Enemy weak points have been added to reward strategic gameplay, which if targeted can trigger explosions or cause enemies to die in spectacular new ways.</li>
<li>Re-tuned Kay's blaster and pickup weapons to improve the combat experience, including being able to carry two handed weapons in more situations.</li>
<li>Facial expressions and animations in dialogue scenes have been improved, the option to toggle off the cinematic lens during gameplay has been added, and the visibility of distant lights has been improved.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The full list of changes has plenty of interest in it. As well as enemy noggins now taking more damage when shot, weapons themselves have been adjusted, with new damage values across the board and revisions to spread and recoil. As if to balance these changes, enemies will now use cover more capably.
</p><p>"It’s hard to get lost in the scoundrel fantasy of stealth that lets you knock out an imperial officer in the middle of conversation with a subordinate to no suspicion; that lets you drop loudly from a walkway a few feet away from an oblivious stormtrooper, only to take him down with one of several ponderous, bubble-wrapped canned animations," wrote Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "But there’s still fun in the <em>performance</em> of outsmarting science fiction’s most famously maladroit mooks, even if all you’re doing is keeping crouching pace with the reverse side of a floating baggage carrier."
</p>
<p>I've yet to play Outlaws, but I'd like it to be good, and I typically enjoy crouching around Ubisoft games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>. Whatever you thought of it at release, it's nice that they're continuing to bring it up to scratch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
