            <p>
Are you able to picture things in your head? Try it, right now, we'll go for the classic thing to picture, an apple. If you can't see diddly squat, you've potentially got aphantasia, a condition which is essentially the inability to visualise an image within your head. It's interesting to me because I feel I'm on the opposite end of it, I can picture that apple pretty darn clearly. With that in mind, it makes me all the more curious about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/afantasia">Afantasia</a>, spelled with an f not a ph, a "surreal exploration game about a boy searching for identity in his hometown."
</p>
<p>
Afantasia, even with its stylistic misspelling, is a great name, I think, because it is a game I quite deeply enjoy looking at. There's a lo-fi quality to it, a pixel art point &amp; click game pushed into the third dimension. It's moody, a little grimy and grungy, with an appropriate amount of mystique around it. The game's Steam page gives very little away, but offers just enough to entice me.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
As mentioned, it's point &amp; click, but there's also exploration in what looks like possibly second person, and what definitely is first person perspectives. One of the few bits of descriptive text explains that you can delve into memories and talk to local townsfolk. The untrustworthy nature of memory and recalled image is a topic I also love seeing explored in games, so I'm quite curious to see what Afantasia does with the theme.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, there's no release date in sight, however, a sliver of good news: there is a demo you can check out to give apparently 30 minutes of your time to, if Afantasia's atmosphere is pulling you in as it is me. And if you don't have time, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3336670/AFANTASIA/">you can always pop it on the ever-growing wishlist</a>.

            <p>
Online video games! They're the future of the medium! Or, I guess they're already here, but still, online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> is very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivor's</a> future. It's a feature that's been promised for a little while now, and developer Poncle have shared a little look at it, as well as a confirmation as to when you can expect it: autumn! This autumn, to be precise, which we're currently experiencing, though a more specific window of time wasn't provided.
</p>
<p>
In a short but sweet little trailer, which shows how all you need to do to make a game online is by pressing the online button (that fabled button far too many people think is effectively real), Poncle showed the simple steps you need to take to go online. You start by setting up a lobby with a unique ID, and when your friends (or enemies) start to join, it'll show you what DLC is and isn't available to play through, presumably depending on whether everyone involved owns a specific piece or not.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The wait is nearly over 🗣️ </p><p>Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh) 🍂</p><p>⚠️ dial-up tones will not be included</p><p>come back next week for another new announcement! 👀 <a href="https://t.co/NEK0aWr1rS">pic.twitter.com/NEK0aWr1rS</a></p></div>— Vampire Survivors 🦇 Emerald Diorama OUT NOW 🧄 (@poncle_vampire) <a href="https://twitter.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
After that, everyone selects their character of choice, and you get to surviving vampires! There's also a short, jokey comment that I genuinely find quite fascinating: "We know no one plays together anyway lmao." This doesn't surprise me! As someone who's put a good few hours into Vampire Survivors, I can't see the appeal of playing with someone else in the slightest, it's a game I play to completely shut off - perhaps shutting off with someone else is the appeal for some, or just having something other than a fidget cube to play around with in your hands while yapping on Discord.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this feature still exists, because clearly either enough people have asked for it, no matter how small a number, or Poncle wanted the option there for anyone who might ever want it. There's a value in options like these, options for requests that come from the minority, and as long as they can be completed relatively sustainably, I hope we see more of them. Yes, I know I'm reading too much into what is obviously a joke! That is the curse called writing, I'm afraid.
</p><p>
In any case, Poncle also said there's another announcement coming next week which looks like it has something to do with someone in a crappy skeleton custom in the woods. There's also a visual suggestion that there'll be more announcements in the weeks following that one, so I guess there's big plans for update 1.4 you'll have to keep an eye out for!
