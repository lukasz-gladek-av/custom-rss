            <p>Stardock and Oxide Games have announced Ashes Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/singularity">Singularity</a> II - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ashes-of-the-singularity-2">Ashes Of The Singularity 2</a>, as people who hate unnecessary extra keyboard presses may prefer - sequel to the sci-fi real-time strategy game Brendy called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-review">"gorgeous, but plain"</a>, adding "there's nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better". The new RTS aims to improve that verdict by introducing: humans. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, but perhaps it'll work out for them.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction," observes Stardock CEO and sometime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wardell">Gamergator</a> Brad Wardell in the announcement release. "Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines." The battling bipeds will join the returning robot and bionic post-human factions in continent-sized scrums encompassing thousands of units. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game will release in 2026, a decade after the first game, and in a show of pure commercial poetry, its story also takes place a decade after the events of the first. Remember to cite this next time somebody tells you that games can't be art.</p>
<p>The new chapter puts you in charge of the United Earth Forces, "a powerful human alliance forged between NATO, China, and Russia, determined to reclaim Earth's territories - including Australia and Africa - as well as vital outposts on planets and moons across the solar system, all previously overtaken by relentless AI and formidable Post-Humans." We'll prise the Sydney Opera House from their stinking cyborg fingers, and paint the surface of Pluto with those quarrelsome brains-in-jars.</p>
<p>Ashes Of The Singularity 2 is the work of a "significantly expanded" dev team, and will feature co-operative and competitive multiplayer together with a skirmish mode. There's a lot more backstory on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intense%20skirmishes%20against%20intelligent%20computer%20opponents">Steam page</a>, together with the announcement that "this is a game that celebrates your strategic skills and rewards you for understanding that logistics, planning and terrain matter." Total Annihilation diehards rejoice, possibly. "We're determined to make the BIG both simple and fun," adds <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3499790/view/547868787733430463?l=english">a dev diary</a> that delves just a little deeper into the base-building aspect.</p>
<p>After being kicked around by Brendy, the original Ashes fell afoul of Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer). In a feature about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/learning-to-love-imbalance-in-strategy-games">learning to love imbalance in strategy games</a>, he noted that "its bland campaign reveals its focus: it serves only to get people into the multiplayer component." Did you play the multiplayer? I have to confess, this game passed me by.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-humans-are-revolting-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-2-the-latest-planet-scale-rts-from-oxide-games]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a> executive producer David Xu has said Riot "can and will do better," after sharing an anniversary video to the game's account on Chinese social media site Weibo that very much looks to be AI slop.</p>
<p>However, Xu hasn't confirmed that the video did use AI in this sort-of-apology, instead claiming this was a "creator-made" video that'd found its way onto the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' spin-off's official channels.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video, since taken down from Weibo (but preserved for prosperity via Reddit and <a href="https://x.com/AroushTheKween/status/1952415263464603741">Twitter</a> reposts from bemused fans), depicts a big concert in celebration of Wild Rift's third anniversary. Or, as the text in the video spells it "aniversary," with the R in "3rd" looking very janky to boot. Several of your faves, including Jinx, Seraphine, and Yasuo, are doing their best to entertain a crowd who at several points look terrifyingly rubber-faced.</p>
<p>While I can't make out any six-fingered hands, there are plenty of visual glitches that you'd expect from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a>, from misbehaving tails to shapeshifting handguns that can't quite decide if they're firing bullets or lasers. Also, this might just be a mistranslation, given this vid appeared on Chinese socials, but one of the song's main lyrics being 'Can we turn up the blower higher' is sending me because it sounds like a Northern teenager gently moaning that they want the air con in their mum's car cranked up.</p>

</span></p><p>Cue lots of miffed fans, and <a href="https://x.com/PapaSmoothie/status/1952850894137246151">Xu's response</a>. "Yesterday we posted a creator-made video on our official Weibo channel that, frankly, did not hit the mark," he wrote. "When we post content on our official channels, it's on us to maintain a high quality bar and be clear about where it came from. Thank you for all the feedback, we can and will do better."</p>
<p>So, allegedly it's all third-party content that shouldn't have gone up on main, but there's been no direct acknowledgement of the AIlephant in the room - or whether Riot might put out more stuff like this in the future. Xu also neglects to mention the video's apparent point of origin, which looks to be an AI production company called '异类Outliers', whose <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/696326982">BiliBili page</a> includes the Wild Rift anniversary video and a section header that machine translates as "Collection: Alien uses AI to introduce you to 100 aesthetic styles".</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr Alien, but I'm good.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-wild-rift-exec-producer-says-ai-slop-looking-anniversary-video-did-not-hit-the-mark]]></content:encoded>
