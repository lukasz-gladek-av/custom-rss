            <p>You! Stop trying to break in! Also, while you're at it, stop using quick use item swapping to shoot me faster than you'd otherwise be able to! All of that is yelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-latest-update-nerfs-an-overperforming-pistol-rebalances-boom-damage-and-also-has-ducks">patch</a>, which sees devs Embark go after a number of pesky exploits and also make piggybacks much less effective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">Update 1.4.0</a>'s notes, a gun exploit which allows shotgunners to rapid fire faster than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back again to skip a reload animation is no more. Dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GFw3n2StWfA">double pumping</a>, the exploit was typically used when wielding Il Toro, which is of course a pump-action lead-slinger. Anyway, it's gone now. You can almost hear that one Call of Duty character who used to yell that switching guns is always faster than reloading shedding a single tear of joy, as the impetus to carry around 20 shotguns returns to Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Embark are sick of folks getting into places they shouldn't be. Hence some burglar-proofing "exploit mitigation mechanisms" being added to every locked room on every map. All of 'em. Exterior access to the locked room in the Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has also been blocked off, so good luck getting in there now.</p>
<p>Rounding out the patch, embark have nixed some lighting glitches, rectified some low-res main menu textures, and made sure restarting the game won't mess up any voices. Oh, and you now can't push other players around by jumping on their backs. Given how key backpacks are to raider fashion, this probably isn't the game to be try to get a surprise ride on your mate in. Even if you're only trying to shift them out of the way of a door. They might have a bad back, and that's probably making their life in robo-ruled future Italy tough enough without your antics.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev team is set to grow substantially over the next couple of years, as CD Projekt ramp up development. While most of their ranks right now are on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, a game that's at least made some public cameos even if it's still sans release date, once 2027 rolls around, Cyberpunk 2 looks like it won't be too far behind.</p>
<p>This info comes from the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf">financial report</a>, covering the time running from July 1st to September 30th this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their presentation, CD Projekt interrupted some shouting about the original Cyberpunk continuing to sell well by showing off a developer headcount graph forecasting how they plan to continue "laying the foundations for Cyberpunk 2" across 2026 and 2027. These efforts follow lessons CD Projekt have said they learned from the first Cyberpunk's infamous launch, with <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/cyberpunk-2077-was-a-valuable-lesson-adam-kicinski-on-work-organi/zb3a43">understaffing around the pandemic</a> contributing to in the run up to crunch and more game-centric foibles like the RPG's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cdpr-says-its-new-boston-studio-means-cyberpunk-2-will-be-more-authentically-american/">European-style manhole covers</a> being a symptom of some struggles for a Europe-based dev team to really nail the nuances of an American dystopian city.</p>
<p>As of October 31st this year, the studio says 135 devs are working on Cyberpunk 2. The graph shows Cyberpunk 2's development is split across teams in Warsaw and Vancouver, as well as a bigger group at the newer Boston studio CD Projekt set up specially to work on the sequel. As of these financials, the 135 cited look to mainly be in Boston, with CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">noting</a> that team's around 80 people strong and mostly senior level staff.</p><p>"Having accomplished our goal of building a strong leadership team at its core, we are now shifting to hiring more mid-entry level roles to carry on with pre-production works," he explained. "We plan to expand the Boston-based Cyberpunk team as the project progresses, and double it in the next two years." So, that'd bring the team to about 160-ish people by 2027. Meanwhile, the Canada and Poland-based teams are set to grow, too, so the entire ensemble will swell to just over 300 staff in the same timespan.</p>
<p>The graph doesn't give exact numbers for these planned future headcounts and Nowakowski alluded to wanting to "shift the split" between the two sets of devs to "around 50%" in the same time, making it a bit harder to compare these numbers to the 447 devs currently working on The Witcher 4. As of writing, it looks like the 2027 headcount will fall short of that Witchery number by about 100 devs. One thing Nowakowski added is that the company still strongly believe all the investment they have made and plan to make in adding the Boston studio will "pay off in the future, bringing the next Cyberpunk experience to a new level."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that means the teams working on it will eventually come to surpass the number of people CD Projekt chucked at the original, which a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/fy-2020-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about the company's 2020 financial results I've gone back and dug up cites as having been the work of 530 developers. Cyberpunk 2077 was famously plagued with bugs at launch, so hopefully all this investment will see its sequel avoid the same fate. That might not mean lobbing more devs at it, though, especially given a lot of CD Projekt's spending has been with the goal of just being able to work on Cyberpunk and The Witcher simultaneously, rather than switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Either way, with a more deliberate build-up over these next two years, one would hope the result in a smoother road once the game really starts to gather speed. For now, Nowakowski's "happy with the progress the CP2 team has made so far", but warned "it’s for sure too early to talk about entering any next stage or phase of this project".</p><p>Numbers, eh? For now, The Witcher 4's the thing to keep an eye on release-wise as it's far further along in the pipeline, though Nowakowski has <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">tweeted</a> that it won't be popping up at this year's Game Awards following its reveal at least year's iteration.</p>
