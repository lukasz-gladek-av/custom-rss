            <p>Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has launched into early access, and the developers have one of those old-timey roadmaps explaining how it will change before the 1.0 release, give or take a few teasing redactions. This being a game about miniaturised children fighting insects, of course, the road in question may be only a few metres long. A garden pathmap, perhaps? Let's have a look, then. </p><!--more-->
<p>Coming in a fall 2025 update, we can expect a building grid and quality of life improvements, a hotpouch for buggies, and a new boss called AXL, thought to be a spider. With AXL will come a new boss arena, crafting recipes, armor, weapons and furniture.</p>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 update in winter 2025 will introduce Steam Deck verification and cross-play features using a Microsoft account, plus support for rival handheld the ROG Ally. There is also talk of a new park area, a scanning tool called PEEP.R 2.0, a special damage type called Sour 2.0, and a new base-levelling stat, Cosiness. There will be new tier three equipment and omni-tool unlocks, together with a new mushroom set for base-building. Wash that down with a bucket of bugs: new species such as crickets and earwigs, and unspecified variations of existing creepy-crawlies.</p>
<p>The third big Grounded 2 update lands in summer 2026, and is all about swimming and ziplines. Also smoothies that grant status effects, watery bases, watery equipment (and some tier 4 gear and omni-tool unlocks), and some watery critters. There's an unnamed new park area on the way that is also likely to be aquatic in nature. Though I think it would be very funny if it turns out to be a large expanse of gravel.</p>
<p>After summer 2026, we enter the mist of Future Plans. These include more park areas, mutations, buggy customisation and progression, creatures, bosses, building options, and, well, just a whole lot of survival game junk, basically.</p>
<p>So far, the game seems to be doing well, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/">amply exceeding the original's launch player count</a> on Steam. We don't have a write-up for the moment, mostly because our team headcount is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">in the process of being miniaturised</a>, but freelance scribe Matt Reynolds has some guides to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-grub-locations">Grounded 2 grub locations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-thistle-needles-where-to-find">where to find thistle needles</a>, among other challenges.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates]]></content:encoded>
