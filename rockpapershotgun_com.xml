            <p>I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we're all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.</p><!--more-->

<p>There’s no time for such shenanigans in Dante’s Ring. It doesn’t look like it has a sense of humour at all, probably to its credit. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988030/Dantes_Ring/">the Steam page</a>, it’s “an action-adventure RPG with survival and arcade elements, and a disaster combat theme, where you confront the deadliest forces of nature — from raging fires and molten lava to powerful earthquakes.”</p>
<p>You play somebody exploring an extinct volcanic mountain range that isn’t quite as extinct as advertised. Rather than fighting any individual enemies, you must “strive to survive and save as many lives as possible while facing the force of nature, the aftermath of a natural disaster, deep-seated human beliefs, social conflicts, and your own inner demons”.</p><p>To do all this, you’ll scavenge for resources and make use of “retro” gadgets such as propellor-powered sleds and vulcanologist suits, together with more basic instruments such as fireaxes. “Will you fight a frenetic fire or flee from a pyroclastic flow?” the Steam page goes on. “Break the door to rescue someone or stop and give first aid?”</p>
<p>That covers the immediate “disaster combat” aspect, anyway. As regards the themes of belief and social conflict, there’s talk of “complex moral choices” and negotiating between “diverse” NPC factions. The game is hub-based, with the ability to choose a loadout before embarking on a mission. The world appears to evolve from mission to mission, “with outcomes that can influence the course of the story”.</p>
<p>The social/religious theming here sounds laboured, if I’m honest, but I like the idea of a game about making ends meet on the surface of an active volcano. I imagine they have a propagating fire system and fluid physics for the lava. Hopefully, they’ll give the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> a run for their money. Hopefully, they'll also improve on their previous game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">The Invincible</a>, which Julian Benson described as "an engaging sci-fi adventure that can leave you cold and confused the moment it stops holding your hand".</p>
<p>Dante’s Ring will launch into Steam early access next year. If you want something weird and fiery to play in the meantime, there's always <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed doors without a game to their name</a>. Now, sadly, it's the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have "paused operations" after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.</p><!--more-->
<p>Worlds Untold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-the-original-mass-effect-writers-is-making-a-sci-fi-near-future-action-adventure">revealed themselves in November 2023</a> as the creators of "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding", boasting a mixture of Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> alumni. Their first game is or was to be a "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". Back at announcement, Walters spoke of moving away from the space opera RPGs he's worked on in the past and embracing something more linear, perhaps influenced by Naughty Dog's creations. </p>
<p>"It's hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we've made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life," Walters wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">a LinkedIn post</a> this week. "This was not a decision we made lightly - it's been a deeply personal journey, and we're all so proud of everything this team has built together.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities," it continues. "If you're looking for passionate, talented professionals, please reach out - I'd be honored to connect you with some of the best people I've ever worked with.</p><p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold. While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."</p>
<p>Departing team members have been quoting the post and providing their own context. While Walters ends his message on a more hopeful note, the takeaway seems to be that Worlds Untold as it stands will effectively cease to exist. "Very sad and gutted, especially so close to the holidays," writes former senior gameplay designer Elaine Gómez. "Our entire studio is getting laid off at end of year." Former senior producer Kitty Lee is also describing the announcement as a "full studio shutdown".</p>
<p>2024 continues to be an awful year for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, including at studios run by veteran blockbuster developers looking to start afresh. The gutting of Worlds Untold and Humanoid Origin follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">the closure of Netflix's Team Blue</a>, another studio founded by blockbuster veterans that never managed to announce a single game. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> developers Inflexion - founded by BioWare's former general manager Aaryn Flynn - have also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-cant-outfly-the-stark-realities-of-the-industry-as-creators-inflexion-close-uk-office-and-lay-people-off">announced cutbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody at Worlds Untold now looking for a new job.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
