            <p>Carcinisation comes for us all, in time. Today, it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s turn. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455990749">crustacean nation mod</a> adds four legendary lords, heroes, 27 crabulous units, new spells, plus custom tech and building trees for a complete crab-paign experience. It would have been shellfish of me not to share, if not downright altruistic to avoid any and all crab puns.</p>

<p>I played a few turns as King Crab, who appears have to appropriated Greasus Goldtooth's crown and sceptre, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't suit him. You start on the eastern coast of the Empire, at war with a Marienburger lord named "Simon Crab-Hunter' and some Norscans. Your unique campaign mechanic here is a resource named Gleaming Shells, which you'll spend on commands similar to Karl Franz's - refresh army movement range ("scuttle onward"), make yourself immune to trespassing penalties, and so on. You also start with two units of crab knights, which are crabs riding bigger crabs.</p>
<p>The mod is by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023503085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710">Pegaz</a>, who's made several others for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, such as some unique <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412700662">Ogre Maneaters</a>. As with most custom faction mods, you'll need <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859968660">Mixu's unlocker</a> to use it.</p>

<p>We're still awaiting the reveal of the final official faction set to join Norsca and Slaanesh for the next DLC, Tides Of Torment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">The current favourite is the high elves</a>, specifically naval commander Sea Lord Aislinn. Preferably with massive <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/high-elf-realms-merwyrm-2025">Merwyrms</a> in tow, mainly so I can shout "That's not your wyrm, it's Merwrym!" at my stunned and jealous enemies. The reveal should be coming next month.</p>
<p>There's also a good chance we'll be hearing some news about the fabled Total Warty Thousand by the end of the year, say I. Although even if that doesn't end up happening, Creative Assembly have announced the announcement, announcedly, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">new Total War games this December</a> as part of an anniversary showcase. I crab not wait. Pincer me, I'm dreaming. It's Lobster get excited about. I shell go sit in the corner and think about what I've done now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-entire-crab-army-comes-to-total-war-warhammer-3-in-the-crustacean-nation-mod]]></content:encoded>
