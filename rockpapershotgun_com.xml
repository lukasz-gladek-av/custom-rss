You know, with there being so many games set in ancient Rome, most of them being strategy games, I'm not sure I've ever seen a pixel art game with that setting. I bring this up because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a>, a pixel art game with that exact setting, just got announced at the Future Games Show. From the offset it looks a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>, and according to the publisher behind it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/three-friends">Three Friends</a> themselves, the latter is in fact a source of inspiration, alongside SNES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Described as a survival town-builder, Romestead lets you rebuild civilisation from ruin as a Roman leader (which as a concept considering publisher Three Friends is made up of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> devs). That involves things like putting your people to work by farming crops, smithing weapons, rounding up resources, all things you appear to be able to do yourself too, so I imagine you can't be tyrant right from the get go, as was typical of many Romans back in the day.
</p>
<p>
There's a worship system where you can pray to a bunch of Roman gods to unlock various buildings, upgrades, technologies, all of which I find amusing very conceptually. "You have prayed enough to me so I give you the gift of a slightly bigger house" is how I imagine to play out, which tickles me in a "aren't video games so quaint?" kind of way.
</p>
<p>
That Zelda element comes in through dungeons that you can explore and bosses you can face off against, and a big ole world to explore too. And to boot you don't have to do it alone as there's multiplayer co-op too.
</p>
<p>
Romestead doesn't currently have a release date, but it is planned for an early access release. If this all takes your fancy, then you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805320">here</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZOI</a> kind of looks like an exercise in pushing the uncanny valley to me, something I'd wholeheartedly respect if that were definitely the intention behind the game, but I have a hunch that it really is just meant to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but if it looked like real life. Whether that's enough to win over Sims lovers or not, I'm not sure, its early access release isn't until next week so we'll all know more then. However! You do now have the opportunity to try and test the limits of its character creator, as like a few games have done in recent years, its Create a Zoi feature is available to download as its own thingâ€¦ if you're happy to do a bit of homework.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In order to get a code for the inZOI: Creative Studio, you'll need to watch someone play the game on Twitch, SOOP, Chzzk, or through a livestream on the official inZOI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">Steam page</a>. They all have <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8324">different requirements</a>, mind - on Twitch and Chzzk, you need to make sure you have your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/krafton">Krafton</a> ID linked to whichever streaming service you're watching on, have inZOI in your Steam wishlist, and watch someone play the game for at least 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can just watch the stream on Steam for 30 minutes to get a key. 
</p>
<p>
I can't tell you how to watch it on SOOP because Krafton didn't explain how, and it's a Korean streaming service, and they don't seem to have posted what to do on their English socials, so honestly if you're desperate you should probably just watch someone on Twitch.
</p>
<p>
It's not just the Create a Zoi feature you'll have access too, as a Build Studio mode will be included too. This one lets you have a fiddle with building different rooms. It's not the full package, obviously, but seems like a good demo to check out if your greatest passion in The Sims is making Sims and building houses, but aren't sold on those features in inZOI just yet. Personally, the Zois scare me, so I'll leave it to you to try it out.
