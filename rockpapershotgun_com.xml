            <p>
Nine years after securing $3.2 million on Kickstarter and mere weeks after launching into Steam Early Access, MMORPG Ashes Of Creation is in humongous difficulties. The game’s entire leadership team have allegedly quit “in protest” at decisions made by the board of Intrepid Studios, with creative director Steven Sharif accusing board members of “directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out”. Other staff have announced that they've been laid off, with one calling it the end of the studio.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-creation-kickstarter">Kickstarted back in 2017</a>, Ashes Of Creation finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">launched in Steam early access</a> on 11th December. It’s an ambitious concoction - a game in which players will collectively organise to “build cities” and “forge empires” amongst other realm-rewriting feats - but the early access launch version has attracted a mixed user reviewer response. 
</p>
<p>Intrepid sought to reassure the nay-sayers in <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">a blog post on 29th January</a>, listing a few problems such as cheating and performance issues, but a few players noted that this “director’s letter” was attributed to the AOC team rather than Sharif. In hindsight, some of the language in the post strikes me as rather ominous. For example:</p>
<blockquote>Game development, especially at this scale, is rarely linear. Systems evolve. Assumptions are challenged. Foundations must sometimes be reworked, so what comes next can stand strong. That process can be uncomfortable, particularly in an open development environment where you see the seams as they’re stitched. But it is also what allows us to build something ambitious, durable, and worthy of your investment.</blockquote>
<p>
Then, on Saturday January 31st, director of communications Margaret Krohn abruptly declared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that her time at Intrepid had "officially ended”, while claiming that other developers had lost their jobs. Asked whether Ashes Of Creation had been cancelled, she replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off." 
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGamesN</a>, senior environment artist Adam Anthony, QA engineer Keith McAvoy, senior character artist Jessica Jennings, and animator Brad Constantine have all announced on LinkedIn that they’ve been laid off. Anthony has referred to these events as "the closing of Intrepid Studios”.
</p>
<p>
Sharif has also given some comment on Discord, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashes-of-creations-leadership-team-quits-in-protest-as-director-accuses-board-of-decisions-he-could-not-ethically-agree-with-or-carry-out">Eurogamer</a>. "I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," he wrote in the wake of Krohn’s post. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out.</p>
<p>"As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification] Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."
</p><p>
We’ll reach out to Intrepid to ask whether Intrepid has, indeed, been closed. Best of luck to all the devs now looking for new work. Ashes Of Creation is still available on Steam, as of writing - there's a 'development update livestream' planned for Friday 13th February, but something tells me they'll change the schedule.

            <p>The new custodians of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> have announced that they’re giving the city builder’s UI an “extreme makeover” in the game’s next patch, while tuning up the day/night lighting, and ensuring that snow actually sticks to the ground. I had an “extreme makeover” once and ended up with ginger hair for several months. Being a redhead didn’t really pan out for me, but I'm cautiously enthusiastic about Skylines 2’s new toolbar.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“We know that the UI can sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to communicating things,” Iceflake <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/502848649741467986?l=english">write on Steam</a>, “and while it’s still a work in progress, we’re really excited to show you the first changes we have made towards making the UI clearer to understand. </p>
<p>“We have streamlined the onboarding process and changed some icons to be more expressive and easier to understand the context from them. The toolbar has had the most changes as the colors and the visual style have gone through a big makeover. Now there are more round shapes, and the demand bars have more focus.”</p>
<p>Here’s a WIP screen. Behold the additional roundness and focus. Extreme enough for you?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the devs are adding the ability to set custom colours for buildings and vehicles, inspired by yenyang’s “Recolor” mod – they may also eventually let you twiddle with the colour of trees and plants, favourite a colour, and apply colours to whole districts.</p><p>Aside from tuning up the daytime and nighttime lighting, they’ve rebalanced the cloud system so that you’ll probably see more clouds, and made it so that fog levels now respond to other weather – you might get more fog during storms, for example. Snow will also settle properly in lots, once the patch is live.</p>
<p>“We have already begun the process of improving other aspects of the environment, like ground textures and how to make them look more realistic, as well as being able to plop trees much closer together and toggling their age,” the devs add. “While some of these improvements might not be ready for this first patch, we are hopeful that they will be ready for the next one.”</p>
<p>They’ll describe the next patch’s mechanical changes in a separate blog post, and suggest that you “will be able to see these changes firsthand in the second half of February”. One thing that won’t come in the next patch is a planned in-game encyclopedia with a search function.</p>
<p>Iceflake Studios – a Paradox-owned joint previously known for post-apocalyptic city builder Surviving The Aftermath - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-creators-colossal-order-are-handing-the-series-over-to-the-surviving-the-aftermath-devs">took over development</a> from original Skylines 2 developers Colossal Order at the start of 2026, following an announcement last November. At the time, Paradox framed cutting ties as a “mutual” decision, while Colossal Order said they had left to "work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities”. </p><p>The cynical read, of course, is that Paradox actually gave CO the boot and are simply masking their disappointment about how Cities: Skylines 2 has performed. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">had a mixed launch reception</a> and required <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">a lot of fixing</a>. I think it’ll take more than flakier backyards and a rounded UI to right the ship, but it’s a good start.</p>

            <p>This week in new PC games: some new PC games. Look, sometimes I have the energy and fortitude to write a 500 word overture about four dimensional tapeworms, and sometimes I look upon the intro as nothing but a hateful chore. I just want to list some games, but internet etiquette requires that I occupy your eyeballs with a proper paragraph or two before we break out the bullet points.</p>
<p>Is this enough of a preamble yet? No? How about now? Come ooooon, there’s a tasty new tactics RPG at the bottom of the page. Scroll down, you apes!</p><!--more-->

<h2>Wednesday 4th February</h2>

<li>If you hated Silksong's diagonal pogo you may wince over parts of the trailer for precision platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925120/The_Pale_Piper/">The Pale Piper</a>, but you might also whistle at the shadowy and decaying backdrops.
</li><li>The latest spin on Lethal Company's drudgecore extraction romp format is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/">YAPYAP</a>, in which you and up to four others play wizard's minions invading another wizard's tower.

<p>What are we of the Treehouse doing this week? Well, <em>somebody</em>'s reviewing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, and the very best of luck to them. I think a few people have designs on the Menace early access launch, because we are nothing if not partial to playing footsie with mechs. Possibly a desperate soul will find time for Plunkbat Siege as well - I quite like how the walls fall apart. Anyway, let me know if there's a cool game out this week that has unaccountably evaded our eagle's eye.</p></div>
