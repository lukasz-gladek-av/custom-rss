            <p>
Every once in a while, a game rocks up that so quickly finds itself in my Steam wishlist I don't even remember clicking the button. Today, that game is Rakshasa, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> inspired first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in modern India where you must face off against demi-gods and "centuries-old flesh-eating monsters" inspired by Indian folklore. Yeah! Hell yeah! Yeah, yeah sign me up!
</p>
<p>
The reveal trailer for this thing absolutely drips with muck and grime, almost in that nasty cyberpunky kind of way, yet still grounded in a city setting we're all familiar with. But you'll also find yourself in ancient temples and rundown slums alongside the luxury apartments. Even from a short trailer there's a suggestion of a lot of texture environmentally.

<p>
Interestingly, despite being first-person, it actually takes a turn-based combat approach, with what appears to be a timing based element when pulling off an attack. Hard to get a read on how this functions moment to moment, but it being an RPG you have your usual upgrade trees to make different builds with, I just can't garner much more than that so I'll leave the combat there. Oh and you can throw snakes! Just, throw 'em. I like it!
</p><p>
Interestingly, this game is actually being made by a YouTube channel called Odd Compass, which makes animated history videos about "under-appreciated events and people in Asian history," predominantly in India. These videos look incredibly well-made too, definitely worth a look if you're a history buff. In the meantime, you can wishlist Rakshasa <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4285930/Rakshasa/">here</a>.

Wizard Pool! It is, probably, exactly what you think it is. You are a wizard, and you play pool. Well, admittedly there is a smidge more to it than that, alongside a healthy amount of charm. Styled in a way that looks like an N64 game in the kind of way you remember that era looking rather than how it actually looked, you play as Kue, a budding young wizard tasked by his uncle to complete a trial in the form of a tower filled with magical, illogical pool tables.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial levels are simple enough, giving you a taste of how it all works; each differently coloured ball has different magical properties. Upon impact one might swap places with the white ball, there's a ball that freezes the white ball temporarily so it slips and slides leaving it out of your control, another ball starts tiny but the harder you hit it the bigger it gets before reverting to its original, miniscule size.

Speaking of, the process of doing the ball hitting is archaic and difficult to get to grips with at first, but won me over steadily enough. You rotate your cue stick clockwise or anticlockwise by pressing the left or right mouse buttons, and then you must physically position the mouse and move it to hit the white ball, the speed with which you do so affecting the strength of your hit. As stated, odd at first, yet delectably tactile when you get used to it.
</p><p>
Things steadily get more and more mixed up as the tables change too, holes appearing in places anywhere but where you'd expect, encouraging you to put a bit more thought into how you position your cue and how hard you might hit the ball. It's neat! And a simple yet engaging little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> arcade game, which even has an online multiplayer option.
</p>
<p>
In the game's quite simple story mode there's even these pre-rendered cutscenes that must be no higher than 480p in quality that for some reason very specifically call Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg in terms of vibes. Something about the lighting, can't entirely put my finger on it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's just a nice way to muck about for a little while, and is cheaper than a cup of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4177880/Wizard_Pool/">Steam</a>, so well worth a shot!

            <p>
I think as long as you make a new year's update post before the incredibly arbitrary date of January 13th, you're still able to do so without me thinking "come on, it's almost February", which is exactly what EA did with their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">new years Sims update post</a>. Perhaps reassuringly, after word came last year of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">EA's concerning acquisition</a>, the post opens by doubling down on what the team has previously said regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">staying committed to their values</a> (those values <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">including inclusivity</a> is welcome though I wish they'd be more explicit about who is being included). But the post also, sort of, goes into what's next for the series.
</p>
<p>
Top of the order of importance is potentially the fact that Project Rene, i.e. not-Sims 5 with an emphasis on multiplayer, is now being described as a "mobile-first" game. The post is explicit about it not being "the successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>," noting it is an "experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience." But its future on PC, or any other platform, is now up in the air.
</p>
<p>
One thing the post does make clear is the studio's commitment to single-player games, even if Project Rene is meant to be more collaborative. "Single-player PC and console experiences will always be a part of our future, with more than half of our global development team dedicated to The Sims 4 and the next evolution," the post explains, though what about that last bit, the next evolution? "More news in the coming months!" Very helpful, thanks.
</p>
<p>
We already know there's not going to be a Sims 5, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">at least last time I checked anyway</a>, so this evolution is limited in its potential. Perhaps a big refresh for The Sims 4? It certainly could do with one, given it's over a decade old now. We'll find out in those theoretically coming months!

Hear ye, hear ye, another extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is almost upon us, this time the smaller but still quite bold in scope Sand: Raiders of Sophie. Last time I personally heard of this game it was just called Sand, which doesn't sound great for that whole search engine thing, though I'm not entirely convinced by the subtitle. Anyway, this extraction shooter is set in an alternate 1910 where you get to roam the desert in a steampunky fortress with legs, and it's got a release month!
</p>
<p>
That release month isn't too far away either, being March, though a month is all you're getting right now as there's no specific date in sight. The perils of game development, I would guess. For those that haven't heard of Sand before, it's a PvPvE extraction shooter where you build large, mobile buildings called Tramplers, a sort of 20th century version of the titular castle from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>'s Moving Castle. You then operate these Tramplers, driving them around so to speak, taking down other players' creations with various weapons you may have attached.

<p>
On the ground level, you as essentially a regular Joe will trawl the "once-resource-rich world of Sophie," all so that you can "uncover hidden riches in the barren wastelands, rectify historical injustices," and lay claim to what you believe is rightfully yours (what that is, I can't tell you). 
</p><p>
There's shooting, there's things to find and extract, there's not-zombies to keep you on your toes when other players aren't about. All of it looks fairly par for the course, the real selling point here are the Tramplers, at least from an outside perspective. If any of this takes your fancy, you can wishlist Sand: Raiders of Sophie right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/SAND_Raiders_of_Sophie/">here</a>.
