            <p>The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> game in development at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a> Games is in difficulties, according to sources of the multiple and anonymous persuasion. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-bioshock-announced">Announced in 2019</a>, the game has reportedly failed a recent internal progress review, with its narrative found to be in particular need of revamping. </p>
<p>Publishers 2K Games aren't talking about any of this, naturally, but they <em>have</em> confirmed that they've treated Cloud Chamber to a not-at-all punitive studio reshuffle, with Kelley Gilmore losing her position as studio head, while former creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been reassigned to a publishing role.</p>
<p>The report comes care of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), who cite "people familiar with the situation". Gilmore and de la Plante's reassignments may not be the worst of the fallout. According to Bloomberg, staff were told at a recent all-hands meeting that they had to become "more agile and efficient" - a phrase equivalent in balefulness to "would you kindly", and a possible indication that layoffs are on the way.</p>
<p>2K Games ain't talking about that either. Here's what they've said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">IGN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote>
<p>Little is known about the new Bioshock, which may not be titled Bioshock 4 inasmuch as reverting to numbered sequels feels a bit ridiculous after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>. I used to win a lot of playground arguments by dint of the formula "timesed by infinity... <em>plus one</em>", but I can't see a major games publisher adopting that particular rhetorical gambit as a naming strategy. Ehhh, maybe Square Enix.</p>
<p>The little we know about the new Bioshock includes the fact that original series figurehead and videogame thespian Ken Levine isn't working on it. He's off making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> at Ghost Story Games. Beyond that, we can only speculate based on previous instalments. There will, presumably, be a man, a city and a lighthouse. It'll be an FPS with a sprinkling of imsim and some arch literary ambitions, and there will be a false utopia of some kind. You will be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand">shoot animals out of your hands</a>.</p>
<p>The Bloomberg report also alleges that 2K Games cancelled a Bioshock 1 remake earlier this year. I think I can probably do without a Bioshock remake, but I'm sorry for any developers potentially affected. Best of luck to all at Cloud Chamber bringing Nushock home.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one]]></content:encoded>
