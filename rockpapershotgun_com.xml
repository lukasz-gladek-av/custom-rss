            <p>
Remember how the upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-co-op-sci-fi-robot-shooter-arriving-next-year">meant to launch in 2022</a>? Good times! And quite different times, because back then the game was PvE, seeing you and a few friends take on some nasty bots. Three years on, the game has shifted into a PvPvE experience, and the reason for 1. such a lengthy delay, and 2. a complete change in what players actually do is a simple one: the game was "not fun."
</p>
<p>
This isn't me being snarkily mean or anything, these are the words of Embark Studios' CEO Peter Soderlund himself. Speaking to Edge (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/the-5th-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam-ex-battlefield-devs-extraction-shooter-arc-raiders-was-delayed-3-years-because-they-realized-it-sucked-this-game-is-not-fun/">GamesRadar</a>), Sonderlund spoke of what it took to get the game to where it is now, explaining, "We loved every aspect of what we were trying to design. But we came to the conclusion, after quite a long time: 'Guys, this game is not fun.'"
</p>
<p>
To be specific, it apparently was more a case of not being fun enough than outright bad or boring. This then led to the team going back to figure out what the game's fundamentals were only six months before its supposed launch, and lo and behold, the PvPvE gameplay it now has was born.
</p>
<p>
Embark devs features an array of PvP pedigree, including some that have worked on both Battlefield and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> (shame there's not a third Battle game to list here), but many apparently felt ready to move on from PvP as a format. So the 'vE' element really helped to mix things up, especially because the game also took some cues from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> with its massive enemies to take down, although in this case they're big ole robots instead.
</p><p>
And now, all this time later, there's less than a month to go until we find out whether it ultimately works for the masses or not. I'm not big on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, but I'll admit the vibes have piqued my curiosity at the very least. My biggest concern, and perhaps the game's too, is it being an extraction shooter. Those that love 'em, love 'em, but they're truly only really for the sickos right now. Let's see if Arc Raiders can take the genre to the mainstream!
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders launches October 30th.

I could probably quite safely bet some money that many of you are still happily ticking away at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, but for those of you that would like newer pastures to get your TTRPG fix in video game form, there's some good news. The board game-esque tactical RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a> at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
You won't be waiting long for it, as it's slated for release this coming November 20th. No pound sterling or euro pricing for the game yet, but in USD it'll set you back $30 - it's also cross-platform and cross-device compatible, so no biggie if your friends aren't on PC! And if it being more Dungeons &amp; Dragons something or other, relatively affordable, and cross-everything isn't enough for you, when Steam Next Fest kicks off next October 13th you'll be able to try out a demo for yourself.

<p>
This demo lets you try out a couple of encounters, with four heroes to choose from, including Jessix, a "human ranger seeking retribution" that is apparently a new reveal alongside this release date announcement! Plus, playing the demo will unlock an exclusive cosmetic for your d20s in the full game. Free stuff! Nobody hates free stuff!
</p><p>
If you haven't even heard of Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked before, well, it's a crossover between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>, which is also a fantasy, board game-esque tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, albeit set in its own world, with (you guessed it) D&amp;D! You move little figures around a board while going through different campaigns, a big selling point being that it has online multiplayer, something Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked will also have. And you'll be able to play it in VR too if that takes your fancy!
</p>
<p>
Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is out November 20th, later this year.

            <p>
There's a strong chance a good few of you out there saw that initial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> trailer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">last year</a> and thought "I'll take a piece of that pie." You came pretty close to getting your slice too, as it was due out next week on October 8th… except the devs have announced that it's been delayed. Indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348?l=english">Steam news post</a>, Redemption Road apologised for not meeting the release date before explaining why the delay is taking place. "In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier." The post notes how the team is 80% engineers, and that they set out to make the game with a goal of making sure the game runs at a true 60 frames per second even on midrange PCs, "without the need for fake frames."
</p>
<p>
Redemption Road further explained all the things that supposedly makes the game so complicated, with battles featuring "tens of thousands of soldiers," and there being "giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed… Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore - with or without their own personal army of thousands. We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, this is an indefinite delay, there was no suggestion from Redemption Road as to when it could possibly come out. Still, a delay less than a week from release is pretty surprising just because of how close it actually is. Looking at the game itself, I do feel less surprised.
</p><p>
There really are just a metric tonne of NPCs on screen at any one time, there's anachronistic guns, tanks, and cars, you can build stuff, a lot of moving parts are clearly at play here! Good look to the devs.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> has been out for - hang on, let me just check my calendar… crikey, that long? - four years now, and despite being a behemoth of a game that I could never imagine seeing absolutely all of, I imagine there are some of you out there that have and crave new ways to go about that. So how about a mod! One which doesn't exactly turn you into Geralt of Rivia, but does at least let you fight like everybody's favourite witcher.
</p>
<p>
This particular mod comes from therealsqueam (as opposed to the fake squeam you've been hearing about), and is quite simply titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/8707">Witcher - Moveset Mod</a>" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fight-like-a-witcher-in-elden-ring-thanks-to-this-ingenious-moveset-mod/">PCGamer</a>). There's even a little video showcasing the mod from therealsqueam that you can check out below, but I'll tell you the important bits here too. The mod has three main bits, essentially. You get two swords, one steel for dealing with a majority of enemies, the other silver for handling the undead, and for the third part there's signs, those witchery spells Geralt uses.
</p>

<p>
Both swords play the same, though they do come with different Ashes of War. The sword combat does admittedly move quite similarly to how Geralt does, there's a nice flow to it and almost a dancer-like quality as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, the signs. For Aard, using a little FP sends out a small shockwave, and charging it up results in a greater area of effect for more damage. Then there's Axii. When you're in range of an enemy, casting it on them will bring them to your side, though it does have a wind-up meaning you should exercise caution.
</p><p>
While you can typically be quite defensive in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, that's not the case in The Witcher 3, so for that there's Quen. Using this one briefly raises poise and reduces damage, and light attacks won't affect you. After you've been hit five times, it explodes for some added damage too. 
</p>
<p>
Igni is the steel sword's Ash of War and is pretty simple, you just shoot out fire! But you can also add a flame buff to your sword. Switching to the silver sword lets you use the final sign, Yrden, which does a couple different things too. One is placing a sign on the ground that heals you, which also lures in enemies, dealing lethal damage to revenants and wraiths. You can also cast a holy buff on your sword to prevent undead reviving.
</p>
<p>
It's a very neat mod overall! Clearly well thought out and put together, and seems worth a punt if you like the idea of a more witchery take on Elden Ring.

            <p>
Remember last month when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a> developer Red Candle Games started teasing… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-devs-behind-nine-sols-tease-a-possible-follow-up-with-a-mysterious-fictitious-creepypasta-video-essay">something</a>… related to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>? That something leaned much more into the studio's horror origins, and as it turns out has developed into a whole entire ARG. I won't dive into every last detail of said ARG, you can go down that rabbit hole yourself. However it has led to something interesting: Red Candle Games have hidden an entirely new game within Nine Sols.
</p>
<p>
To unlock this game within a game isn't particularly complicated. After making sure you have the game installed, head to the Betas tab in the game's properties. Here, just type in "shanhaiarchive" and a download will start letting you play what is essentially a completely different, relatively short, first-person horror game. According to the devs themselves, this strange little game tasks you to save someone called Yuuki - the beta branch itself is titled "yuukimindscape." It's also worth noting that this appears to be a limited-time event, so if you might want to carve out some time for it.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting is that this game-within-a-game may spoil some story elements of Nine Sols, so if this has you so curious that you want to play it even if you haven't played the original, keep that in mind if you're particularly spoiler averse. I'll avoid going into any of that here so that you can experience it all as fresh as possible.
</p>
<p>
It's still not particularly clear if this is leading to something else, like a sequel or a spin-off of some kind, but I'm deeply into it. Nine Sols felt like quite the change in tone for Red Candles Games, their first two works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> both sitting in the horror genre, so I'm finding this quite a clever use of their own skills.
</p>
<p>
In any case, Nine Sols is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/">half off on Steam</a> from now until October 6th as part of the autumn sales, so it's a good time to get on board the mystery train.
