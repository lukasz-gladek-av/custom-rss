            <p>You are leaving the mission area, soldier! Actually, the mission area is leaving you. It is sick of your shit. It has decided that your foxhole isn’t part of acceptable reality anymore. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s long-awaited battle royale mode seems likely to be revealed on 28th October. In less than a week, we could be laying eyes on the Battlefield interpretation of the well-worn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">Plunkbat</a> and/or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> premise of a vast map fringed by corrosive oblivion that shrinks overtime, forcing scavenging players into a claustrophobic last stand.
</p><!--more-->
<p>A datamine of EA’s own app has disclosed (on <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">Xitter</a>, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/battlefield-6-may-be-getting-its-battle-royale-mode-next-week/">VGC</a>) a piece of content for next week’s Battlefield 6 Season 1 rollout called “Granite”. Which isn’t that revealing, but Battlefield 6’s developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">hitherto said</a> that they plan to begin the game’s seasonal update career with a touch of Fortniting, so the timing adds up. 
</p>
<p>“There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale,” they observed earlier this month. Friend, had you told me you were “ideating on new ideas” in-game I’d have gunned you down like a dog, possibly using the M357 Trait sidearm due to be added on November 18th. 
</p>
<p>We already know that Season 1 will bring maps, modes, timed events, vehicles, attachments, guns and melee weapons. The biggest thing missing from the current roadmap is that promised battle royale functionality. Again, the Granite shoe fits. I am interested to see what they call the mode - Battlefield Royale, Player Unknown’s Battlefield 6 and Battlefortnite are all there for the taking.
</p><p>I guess it’s possible that they’re literally adding some granite to Battlefield 6. I’d actually love to play a Battlefield game that blurs the lines with Minecraft in updating the levels with different materials. Possibly this is something you can already do in Battlefield’s Portal editor, when you’re not using it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">jumpstart the progression</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, so, I've thus far failed to grow a second pair of hands, despite Edwin suggesting me and Oisin try. Sorry, mate. As a result, here's a quick run around the houses of interesting stuff we've not covered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">yesterday's Galaxies showcase</a> that I think's worth nattering about.</p>
<p>Look, you can't ask a person to choose between writing about a shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> expansion and some other things that folks in the RPSverse may also be interested in hearing about. I can't be expected to make decisions. That's illegal.</p>

<p>Without further waffle, that DLC for apocalypse wagon scavenger Pacific Drive is called Whisper in the Woods. It's out now and boasts and 8 to 12 hour-long story you can jump into after trundling through the first few hours of the base game. "Witness the rise of a group of Anomaly-obsessed fanatics" its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam blurb</a> declares, adding you'll run across weird artefacts which can make your journeys more dangerous as you explore the expansion's murmuring thicket.</p>
<p>I dug the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">base game</a>'s blending of driving game car tinkering with post-apocalyptic survival intrigue, though it hasn't tempted me back to fire up the bodged motor again since that point. Into the backlog list it goes.</p>

<p>Next up, a fresh trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> 2, the shooty and sawy sequel to (you'll never guess) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>. It's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">coming in 2026</a>. "PURGE THE HERETICS" it screams as a train arrives to mess shit up, amid action Doom-loving dads (and other folks) would likely dig. There's also a moment early on when the protagoist is dropped out of a rubbish chute, the world's angriest partially-eaten sandwich.</p>
<p>Moving on, and train skateboard thing Denshattack got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBMJQDpo__w">release window</a>. It's out in Spring 2026. James has already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">waxed plenty of lyrical</a> about it.</p>
<p>Finally, Solasta II's set to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecp8AtdDdSg">head into early access</a> early next year. Wait, is that the same RPG sequel to Solasta: Crown Of The Magister that was apparently supposed to launch into early access next year as of December last year, according to this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-is-getting-a-sequel-starring-baldurs-gate-3s-narrator">bit from Nic</a>? No idea, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2975950/view/632317708781750334?l=english">Steam post</a> that says it's definitely off into early access in 2026, so I'm certain it'll get there at some point. There's also a demo out now.</p>
<p>Finally Finally, I just want to quickly mention Shroom &amp; Gloom, a fungal roguelike double-deckbuilder which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEol2-8R6s">looks pretty cool</a> and also has a demo out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271280/Shroom_and_Gloom/">Steam</a>. Annnnnnndddddd, exhale.</p>

            <p>
First-person undersea scare-o-puzzler Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss launches April 16, 2026, as announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies showcase of less than blockbustery videogame darlings</a>. It kind of looks like a marginally more combative Soma with less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-nod-to-nietzsche-in-soma-got-me-thinking-twice-about-that-suffocating-buzzword-immersion">philosophical subtext</a>, which sounds like a solid Friday night to me. It's also an opportunity for some hipfire scattergun commentary about the Lovecraftian premise of sights beyond comprehension, and how this gels with videogames, an artform that has "video" in the title. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As described on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760560/Cthulhu_The_Cosmic_Abyss/">Steam</a>, Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss sees you and a sinister chatbot accomplice exploring Cthulhu's prison, the ancient submerged city of R'lyeh, while resisting "the creeping madness caused by Cthulhu's influence". You've found your way there while investigating a lost mining station, deep beneath the Pacific.</p>
<p>There's a secret at the heart of R'lyeh "that could shatter your understanding of reality". All this talk of madness and shattering notwithstanding, the release date trailer deals in familiar Lovecraftian imagery. There are tentacles, fish monsters, mutated humans, and streets of snotty, graven stone that spiral upwards and downwards in frightful ways.

I was going to do my usual routine of putting my hands on my hips and saying "well that doesn't look very incomprehensibly cosmically horrible to <em>me</em>, it looks like a bunch of feisty trout people, upside-down windows and flagrant Orientalism". But this kind of thing is perfectly in keeping with Lovecraft's own descriptions of Cthulhu, which are nowhere near as fancy as I'd love them to be. "The Thing cannot be described," he writes in <a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx">The Call of Cthulhu</a>. "There is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled." Then he proceeds to talk about Cthulhu being green and greasy with big "flabby" claws and a squid for a head.

I generally think that the better recent "Lovecraftian" cosmic horror seizes upon Lovecraft's artier abstractions and twists them further. For example, I find R'lyeh itself a lot more intriguing than the depiction of absolute unit squidman Cthulhu. Lovecraft's narrator in the story makes a loose connection to futurism, the Italian early 20th century art movement that dealt in worlds smashed and hastened by combustion engines and electricity, producing city paintings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Street_Enters_the_House">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>"Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city," Lovecraft's awestruck voyager expounds, "for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs." 
</p>
<p>
I'd love to play a Lovecraftian game that runs with that analogy and puts Euclidean geometry under more artful stress, rather than just bending what could otherwise be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> 3 maps in silly ways. I'm not sure you can pursue such ideas in Unreal Engine, much as The Cosmic Abyss may decorate its cavern roofs with inverted masonry - Unreal Engine games come with a certain built-in visual register and audience expectations. Still, perhaps that shattering secret at the heart of the game will surprise me. It looks like they have a black hole down there. Always keen on a black hole somewhere it shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of black holes, I will tell you about my one moment in a videogame that compares to Lovecraft's account of cracking the seal on R'lyeh and - in the seconds before Johnny Octochops emerges - encountering a "tenebrousness" that has an unambiguous "positive quality", bursting forth "like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings". It was while playing <a href="https://zenorogue.itch.io/relative-hell">Relative Hell</a>, which I've written about here and there. It's a shmup that, to pack everything down, models <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space">ideas about spacetime</a> I do indeed struggle to describe, inasmuch as my own subject-verb-object grammar is a product of 'classical physics'.
</p><p>
In every game of Relative Hell I've played, I've slid off the surface of legible reality and found myself at large in a frictionless yet enveloping dark sphere with coloured gameplay props smeared around its profile. I cannot work out what it means to move in that sphere and it scares the shit out of me. The developer's notes don't help. Here is one: "in the pause mode, when you advance/revert the time, you can see a dark circle -- this represents your "future", that is, the area reached by the light you emit currently (you can theoretically affect this future), or "past", the area you would have seen by now." If the shadows parted and Cthulhu appeared, it would be a relief, frankly.

            <p>Yesterday was Fallout Day, the date in the series' universe when the bombs dropped and permanently turned a lot of people into those skeletons you grind into dust while tramping about in your power armour. Bethesda awakened Todd Howard from cryo-sleep, and announced some stuff in a broadcast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> are being sold to people again. Also, in admittedly more exciting news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Burning Springs update got a proper release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming second series of Prime Video's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-radiates-new-vegas-with-a-trailer-heavy-on-stupid-sexy-house-and-a-december-debut-date">Fallout TV Show</a> was also there, with that and the 76 update set to make December <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enlisting-walton-goggins-for-a-fallout-76-expansion-in-total-tonal-tandem-with-season-2-came-organically-devs-say-despite-previous-hint-at-very-limited-crossover">very Walton Gogginsy</a>.</p>

<p>First, we might as well get the <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> over with. It's mainly a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-esque title engrandening around the RPG hitting Nintendo Switch 2 via a re-release that's also dropping for PC on November 10th. It's basically the all-DLC game of the year edition, but with 150 bits of extra creation club stuff and a new menu dedicated to its more modern form, creations.</p><p>How you feel about both likely depends on whether you're cool with the idea of leaning into mods which have been given the official Bethesda thumbs up to add an extra twist to your thousandth trip through the Commonwealth. Odds are that's much more appealing to console players whose mod access is limited, with the bigger question for us PC folks being whether the anniversary edition's arrival will come with an update to the original game which leaves existing mods in need of a nudge to get working again.</p>
<p>On the even more cynical side, the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas' ultimate edition is <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6CJ0fC8EQZTdOXQD90VAnz/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced">being re-released</a> with a bundle of merch to commemorate its 15th Anniversary. This arrives next year, and will set you back an eye-watering <a href="https://international.gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">£139.99</a> / <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">$154.99</a>. That's for the New Vegas ultimate edition that you can currently get for £4 / $5 / €5 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/13435/">Steam</a> as of writing, thanks to a deal that ends shortly. Or £16 / equivalent if it's reset to regular price and you don't fancy waiting for the next sale.</p>
<p>Why the price hike? Well, there's a PVC statue of Victor, some of Doc Mitchell’s two-headed bear pictures, and a few pins/patches of the clothing variety lobbed into a bigger box. Now, as someone who once bought a cheap fan-made t-shirt with the graffiti logo of Ulysses from the Lonesome Road DLC on it, I may be chucking stones in a glass house here, but er, no, my wallet will be staying closed.</p>
<p>I will, however, likely give Fallout 76's TV Show Ghoul-centric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Burning Springs update</a> a go when it arrives on the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s3LXe6vs14YRUdiQpBhSf/fallout-76-burning-springs-preview">freshly revealed</a> full release date of December 2nd. I'm sceptical it'll be able to avoid feeling like a rather naked cash-in on the Fallout TV Show that struggles to justify its existence much beyond that, but I'll give it a chance to prove me wrong before declaring either way.</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier Todd Howard also popped up during the Fallout Day stream. We know you want things, and are working on things, he told the assembled throngs. Cheers Todd, replied the assembled throngs.</p>

            <p>Speaking as a veteran insomniac who routinely has to operate across time zones, let me share a few of my top tips for staying awake when you really want to sleep. Firstly, fill your eyes with as much light as possible - moonlight, fridgelight, phonelight, flamingoilbarrelight - and your lungs with as much bracing outdoors air as they can take. Secondly, enlist a similarly restless friend for some mutual tickling. Thirdly, remember your failures. All of them. Fourthly, consume a carefully calibrated mixture of fresh fruit and coffee, then look up dad jokes on Reddit.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like any of these proven strategies will work in Sleep Awake, the new first-person "psychedelic" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director and designer Cory Davis and his team at Eyes Out. Nobody wants to tickle you here, going by the trailer. Nobody has any dad jokes to share. They just want to beat you to a bloody sludge with pipes.</p><!--more-->
<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a city called the Crush, the last known city on Earth. Humanity faces extinction thanks to a mysterious force that disappears people when they fall asleep. Such civilisation as remains consists largely of addled cultists, would-be messiahs and assorted lairy randos, all battling desperately to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>The game's levels are strewn with various means of prolonging wakefulness, from that old classic the bed of nails, to dubious brain-modifying technology that resembles the Pilot's throne in Alien. You will creep around, corner to corner, solving puzzles and straying into parallel dimensions that may or may not be hallucinations. There's music from Robin Finck of Nine Inch Nails. They're pretty loud, aren't they? Good choice of rock pedigree for this setup. Imagine if they'd hired Simon &amp; Garfunkel. There'd be no humans left after 30 minutes.</p><p>Sleep Awake now has a release date - December 2nd - announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies Showcase</a> of indie malarkey. Perfect. A decent remove from the Xmas hols, but still close enough to cast a shadow over Santa's strained, unblinking face. You can find a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>. Or you can read Oisin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sleep-awake-a-visually-inviting-horror-game-from-the-dev-behind-spec-ops-the-line-has-a-demo-out-now">slightly mixed impressions</a> of that demo.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle against the bot farmers continues with a series of backend updates from EA. Amongst other things, the developers have reversed some "unintended" changes to XP progression and balance, and removed bots from "verified" modes available through the Portal editor.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Last week, the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-updates-to-speed-up-xp-progression-and-unlocks-as-ea-tackle-plague-of-bot-farmers">announced</a> that they were taking action against players who'd created matches simply to murder computer-controlled soldiers en masse for easy XP. The argument being that Battlefield 6's servers are filling up with XP factories, making it harder for players to find the weird and wonderful mode variations that Portal is supposed to be for. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, the counterargument is that there might be fewer bot-processing joints and more flights of Battle-whimsy in Portal if the game's progression system were less annoying. I didn't find it particularly annoying during my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">pre-release time with multiplayer</a>, but then again, I'm not very competitive-minded and was in no hurry to unlock any of those fancy scopes. Too busy lying on my back, enjoying the deep blue sky over Gibraltar (while bleeding out).
</p>
<p>
I neglected to note in the previous story that Battlefield Studios have a more straightforward monetary interest, of course, in stopping people short-circuiting the XP system. Battlefield 6 is a live service game with a forthcoming battle pass and options to pay for XP and tier skips. It's harder to sell those special editions and Double XP boosters if people can accelerate the grind on custom servers.
</p><p>
Here's an update on their attempts to remedy the situation from Battlefield's social accounts. "We have organized a series of changes to emphasize our commitment to highlighting the player community and making this a space where you can celebrate creativity, find unique experiences, play with friends, and build communities.
</p>
<p>
"As part of this effort, we've rolled out several backend updates to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal. This includes resolving unintended systems that affected XP progression and balance across experiences, and for now, removing bots from Verified Experiences to help improve the overall quality of matches."

Verified experiences are a more curated and grounded selection of Portal modes that mostly let you twiddle with the settings of Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. Unlike other custom modes, these modes award full XP, so you can see why EA would be keen to do away with botfarming in verified experiences.
</p>
<p>
EA have now introduced a change whereby you'll need to disable "bot backfill" if you want full XP gain in a verified mode. Any verified experiences that have bot backfill will need to be unpublished and republished with the change.

"Servers, including persistent ones, may occasionally need to be restarted," the developers add. "These brief interruptions may continue until ongoing improvements are fully implemented."

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s true ending didn't feel totally slam dunk satisfying to me in its 1.0 release form, and developers Supergiant Games seem to have agreed with those sorts of assessments. Hence, in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s first proper post-launch patch they've just put out as a Steam preview, some "true ending enhancements" being rolled out like a boon from a sassy god.</p>
<p>Shameless plug alert, if you want to read my full thoughts on that 1.0 version, you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">this here review</a>. The short version is that it's good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, enough of that, let's dive into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505090299391902119?l=english">the notes</a> for this post-launch first patch preview. "The Patch 1 Preview represents a work-in-progress whose contents may evolve, and some text translations are still in progress," Supergiant wrote. "We do not have a release date for the full patch."</p>
<p>In terms of their true ending tweaks, the studio say they've added some extra events with key characters you'll run into both before and after completing Melinoë's task. Bits of the ending scenes before the credits roll have also been "revised", while one change I can't say I'm necessarily a fan of is that the number of times you'll need to clear the underworld run before getting the final ending has gone up. On one hand, it'll ensure you get more chances to see these new scenes, but on the other, I fear it might feel a bit like padding in a game that's already treading a thin line in that regard towards the end.</p><p>Alongside those ending tweaks, Supergiant have added in a cauldron incantation which lets you go back in time and replay previous story beats, which is handy since it means I won't have to start from scratch to take in the revamped finale. "A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before," reads another of the patch's headline changes, while the decor you can buy for the crossroads now costs less spirit kudos points. Phew, no more lofty rug prices.</p>
<p>In terms of the usual bug fixes and balance adjustments, only one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms has had an aspect tweaked, that being the Witch's Staff's ability to burn folks when imbued with Hestia's smoulder ring cast boon. The boon and blessing specific tweaks are more numerous and a few bosses have had their hitboxes and effects adjusted.</p>
<p>There's more in the full notes, and if you want to give this preview a go, Supergiant have included instructions on how to opt into its Steam beta after backing up your saves.</p>
