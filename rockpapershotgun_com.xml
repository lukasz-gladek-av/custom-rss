            <p>After rapidly declaring that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">looking into action</a> the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have released a hotfix aiming to rectify some of the crashing that's affected players diving Into the Unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike the giant worms I've still seen hide nor mandible of, it didn't take the studio long to address reports of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">uptick in technical issues</a> for the shooter following the update's arrival on Tuesday. Here's hoping that these fixes'll help keep thing a bit more stable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516346126609155527?l=english">hotfix 01.004.001</a>, which has arrived just after the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516345493302804917?l=english">Dust Devils warbond</a>, are pretty short, so I'll aim to ward off my worst tendencies and keep it brief.</p>
<p>Fixes for crashes related to particle effects, post-reinforcement hellpodding, "if the target of a seeking missile gets deleted before impact", aborting missions while driving, or just fighting the automatons in general. All check. Issues with the update's new caves becoming "darker than intended" when on lower graphics settings and an opposing problem with hellpads emitting excessively bright light. Dealt with.
</p><p>The warp pack "getting stuck suspended in the air or crashing". Sorted. Erratic extraction shuttle landings. Rendered a lot safer. Also, the speargun's reload time's been dialled down and the Dust Devils gear's solo silo stratagem's immediately had its cooldown quickened by half a minute.</p>
<p>One fix that isn't in there is for freezing issues <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/1/591780546280097257/">some PC players have reported running into</a> since late August, with machines apparently becoming unresponsive to the point a manual button-press shutdown required. However, over on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1218153537914273802/1411297235425169409">Discord</a>, a player support agent with the handle Bvits has at least said they've "alerted the team that this is happening to some players, they're looking into it".</p>
<p>Right, there you go. Zippy. Succinct. Concise. No rambling here. If you want that, go read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">my impressions from a few hours of Terminid hive world missioning</a> on Tuesday evening.</p>
