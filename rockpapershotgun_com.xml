            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>' first proper patch, assuming you're a member of the honourable sect who don't count <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/776434170343719695?l=english">hotfixes</a> as patches, has arrived. It's relatively small, but it does set up three new map conditions that'll be unleashed in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> this weekend, as well as fixing some pesky bugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">notes</a>, the three new map conditions set to unlock this weekend are what looks to be a night raid variant of Blue Gate, as well as the more mysterious "hidden bunker" and "electromagnetic storm". Here's hoping the last two might be on the same map, given the former sounds like useful shelter from the latter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's bug fix city. The integrated shield recharger only recharging when it's equipped, Augment skills not working all, and health regen skills not working if activated while you're down but not out have all been dealt with. Perhaps the most fun mole that's been whacked is an exploit that was seeing deployables push players through walls.</p>
<p>Embark have also made zipline exit points barricade-free zones and ensured the Well-Travelled achievement triggers as planned. Finally, they've added both "a charge progress for integrated shield repair" and the punch hands pre-order bonus emote.</p>
<p>Edwin's been writing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-out-now-and-the-best-thing-about-it-so-far-is-bumsliding-through-a-buried-desert-city">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-could-get-map-conditions-that-alter-the-friction-for-truly-tribes-esque-sliding">stuff</a> about Arc raiders and you can find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">our review</a> from Samuel Horti here.</p>
<p>"Arc Raiders wants to be one of your 'forever' games: it already has a roadmap for the rest of the year that includes a new map as well as new Arc enemies, items, and quests," reads the latter's verdict. "Its long-term strength will rely on the quality of those updates. I'm not yet deep enough to know whether Arc Raiders will feel this compelling at hour 100 or whether, in two months' time, I'll still be dreaming about it. For now, all I know is that its metallic hooks are in me, and I cannot stop playing."</p>
