            <p>Developer Julian LeFay, a key cog in the early days of Bethesda and the development of classic Elder Scrolls RPGs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena">Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, has died. His passing was announced by OnceLost Games, the studio he co-founded in 2019, and follows a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>LeFay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens">stepped away from his most recent development post</a> as technical director at OnceLost, where he'd been working on Daggerfall-inspired RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> alongside fellow Bethesda veteran Ted Peterson, last week. OnceLost revealed at the time that this was due to his cancer worsening, writing that LeFay's doctors had informed them "his time with us is limited".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement on LeFay's passing aged 59, the studio's team wrote that the Danish-born developer "was not just a colleague - he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today" and praised his "unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve".</p>
<p>"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms," they added, "Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all."</p> <div>

<p>LeFay joined Bethesda as a programmer in 1987, and was a key influence on many other RPGs through his work on Elder Scrolls. He was programming lead on Arena and Battlespire, project leader on 1996's legendary Daggerfall, and is credited on The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>. According to Peterson, his name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YhxCkF09Y">was also an inspiration</a> for Tamriel's god of wisdom and logic, Julianos.</p>
<p>LeFay also served as director and chief programmer on Bethesda's The Terminator and follow-up The Terminator 2029 back in those early days. He largely disappeared from the spotlight after leaving Bethesda, working on various projects including some with Sega, before being dragged back in via an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLGi5RK8V8">interview with YouTuber Ian Phoenix in 2017</a>, which snowballed into LeFay and Peterson deciding to team back up on an RPG that'd be a worthy successor to the likes of Daggerfall.</p>
<p>That led to OnceLost's founding in 2019 and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">Kickstarter for The Wayward Realms</a>. As Peterson and the studio's staff wrote when they revealed LeFay had stepped away from work on the game, their plan is to keep on developing their RPG in a fashion that matches his vision for it.</p>
<p>Thanks to LeFay for all of his contributions to the medium and all the best to those he leaves behind.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PC gaming mouse 'n' keeb manufacturers Endgame Gear have admitted to and apologised for unknowingly spreading malware, after an infected version of the OP1w 4k v2’s Configuration Tool software was left available to download from their website.</p>
<p>After Reddit user Admirable-Raccoon597 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EndGameGear/comments/1m29q06/security_alert_endgame_gears_op1w_4k_v2/">raised the alarm</a>, having installed the Configuration Tool and found the malware hiding inside, German tech site <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/malware-in-official-mouse-software-endgame-gears-op1w-4k-v2-tool-infected-with-xred-rat/">Igor’s Lab</a> confirmed that the publically available application had been compromised for at least two weeks. Endgame Gear have since replaced the dirty software with an apparently safe version, and today <a href="https://www.endgamegear.com/security-update">shared a post</a> admitting the oversight – though claimed no sensitive data was stolen via the server infrastructure that was hosting it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We became aware of this situation involving one of our product pages through online discussions," the statement reads. "Following this, we initiated an internal review to better understand the circumstances and address any potential issues. A clean version of the affected file was immediately published as soon as we identified the situation.</p>
<p>"Importantly, access to our file servers was not compromised, and no customer data was accessible or affected on our servers at any time." </p>
<p>The post adds that the company "sincerely regret this incident and deeply apologise for any concern or inconvenience it may have caused. For Endgame Gear, the security and trust of our customers are paramount. We are fully committed to continuously improving our security protocols to prevent such events from occurring again."</p>
<p>The malware in question, Xred, is a particularly nasty strain: it’s a remote access trojan (RAT) that, if allowed to propagate through a PC system, would allow an attacker to take control and do all kinds of unsavoury things, from nicking passwords and spying through webcams to replacing RPS with PC Gamer in your browser bookmarks. Truly heinous stuff. Luckily it’s also known to Internet security suites, so most firewalls should pick it up – though Admirable-Raccoon597’s post doesn’t mention being warned before executing the infected software.</p>
<p>It’s also not terribly reassuring that Endgame Gear’s statement neglects to identify the breach that saw their innocuous mouse utility fouled by Xred in the first place. The company has at least implemented a variety of additional anti-malware measures, though without users knowing that the specific hole has been plugged, they may have some trouble earning back trust, even if no personal details were pinched from the hosting servers directly.</p>
<p>If you own an OP1w 4k v2 and downloaded its Configuration Tool between June 26th and July 9th, do follow the steps in Endgame Gear’s post to identify and remove any trojany files. Because, yeesh. The worst thing <em>my</em> mouse does to me is blink its lights for no reason, and that still runs me ragged; if it started letting crims seize control of my PC, one of my windows would spontaneously develop a visibly mouse-shaped hole.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-peripheral-makers-deeply-apologise-for-hosting-malware-in-their-mouse-software-by-accident]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bad news everybody, I think I have discovered the game that is going to stop you doing anything else today. Witness the verminous splendour of turn-based puzzler Rat King, in which you simultaneously control two rodents who are exploring two different dungeons in splitscreen. I know, I know – to lose one rat in a dungeon may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness. But there is method to the madness. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Each questing squealer shares the same health bar, but faces a different 5x5 square room layout and enemy spawning patterns. As such, they will inevitably end up out of synch - one rat lodged in the corner of a room, for example, while the other fends off beetles in the middle. You need to work out the sequence of moves that keeps both rats alive, while scooping up coins to spend on items at shops, and guiding the varmints to the staircase to the next floor. 
</p>
<p>
It’s immediately engrossing, and it layers up very satisfyingly. Each rat can move between the rooms of its particular dungeon without waiting for the other, allowing you to effectively "reshuffle" one half of the screen when you can’t see a way to avoid damage. One obvious way to get your skavens in synch is to line them up against parallel walls, but if you bounce off surfaces repeatedly you’ll waken a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>The ghosts are a lovely wordless characterisation of a soft design constraint. The basic idea is just to punish you for brute-forcing the simultaneous-move mechanic, but also, it makes sense that rapping on the walls of catacombs would rouse their resident spectres.
</p>
<p>
Items can be very helpful, though they only apply to the screen half in which they’re collected. There’s an ice cube that freezes a room’s enemies in place, for example, and a purple swirly that spins one rat’s control inputs around, allowing for more flexible movement as long as you don’t confuse yourself. 
</p>
<p>
The latter item makes the game feel like a lockpicking minigame in an Elder Scrolls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but the correct reference here is Michael Brough’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/868-hack">868-Hack</a>, which stole the luncheons and sleeping hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-works-and-why-betting-on-yourself-in-868-hack">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/priceless-play-2nd-november-2018">RPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/868-hack-review-pc">scribes</a> in times of yore. I haven’t played many "broughlikes", or at least, not knowingly, but Rat King already feels like a classic of the form.  I’ve only scraped the skin, I’m sure. <a href="https://torcado.itch.io/rat-king">Find it on Itch.io</a>.
