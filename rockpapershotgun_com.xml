            <p>My feelings about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forest-reigns">Forest Reigns</a> are equal parts enthusiasm and disappointment, inflation and deflation, straight off the back of the announcement trailer. On the one hand, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">a fan of weird forests</a>, which is to say all forests, I'm keen on the prospect of an FPS set in a post-apocalyptic Paris that has been overrun by sentient, pissed-off trees. It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse. On the other hand, the announcement video suggests a game in which you will mostly treat the frenzied flora as a source of "emergent" cover and terrain traps. Have a look.</p><!--more-->

<p>The game's reigning forest isn't "just part of the environment," intones <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/">the Steam page</a>, but "a conscious entity with its own desires and intentions". You will "interact with it to reveal its mysteries, use it for defeating enemies, or face its wrath as it reacts to your choices". So far, your choices seem mostly to consist of "shoot it/don't shoot it". The trees don't like being shot, which seems a bit elementary as "desires and intentions" go. I don't want to talk to them, necessarily, but their objecting to being pumped full of AK47 rounds doesn't feel very mysterious.</p>
<p>There's the suggestion of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis">Gaia theory</a> going on here, but the act of blasting volatile glowy bits or luring plants into strangling foes just look like variations on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>'s exploding oil drums and baitable predators. Still, that isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, and it's possible you'll develop more of a relationship with the trees than can really be shown in an edited gameplay overview. Fingers crossed.</p><p>I don't think this is open world, but it's advertised as non-linear and mission-based, with factions you can cooperate or compete with to unlock different story outcomes. There's also a crafting system and a variety of guns to modify and coo over. Hah, I bet some of those guns are made out of wood, aka trees. I bet the trees don't like that either. So unreasonable.</p>
<p>Forest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> doesn't have a release date. While you wait for one, let me try to lead you into the undergrowth with talk of other tree-themed games. The obvious and most horrible one is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkwood">Darkwood</a>. It makes the trees in what I've seen of Forest Reigns look like the cute, geometric palms from Sonic The Hedgehog. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witch-strandings">Witch Strandings</a>, a curious Kojima homage from Strange Scaffold, and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-devour">Roots Devour</a>, in which you are a tree that drinks blood.</p>

            <p>
Stray Kit Studios, a studio that includes former developers of Age Of Empires, Borderlands and Bioshock, have revealed Wartorn, a real-time tactics roguelite in which two elven sisters pit spells and minions against a brace of fantasy opponents, including ogres. It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I come and go with "painterly" art direction in video games. Often, it just feels like an upmarket way of saying "looks a bit smudged", and smudginess isn't generally desirable in a game where you give soldiers waypoints. But Wartorn (not to be confused with venerable RTS <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21304/wartorn/">WarTorn</a>) does look rather lovely, and the scenically concussed presentation seems to complement the ebb and flow of the game's elemental combos, environment destruction and physics interactions. Still, there's a slow-time mechanic if you feel overwhelmed. Here's a trailer.

<p>
I also like that Wartorn sounds quite story-driven, though I'm less enthused by the on-the-nose talk of moral choices. "Set in a fantasy realm torn apart by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds, Wartorn follows an extended family as they fight to reunite and survive," explains the press release. "Players will make tough decisions, from choosing who gets fed to deciding which lives can be saved, all while confronting the moral quandaries of violence and sacrifice."
</p><p>
As for the roguelite progression stuff - they're calling it "unique", but I don't really see how, based on the press release and trailer. Apparently it "rewards players for perseverance, offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that carry forward with each run", which sounds like business as usual for a liker or liter of rogues.
</p>
<p>
To give you a sense of the pedigree, Stray Kite's co-founder and chief creative officer is Paul Hellquist, former Bioshock lead designer and creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. Co-founder and technical director Shovaen Patel was lead programmer for sparky tower defender Orcs Must Die and Age Of Empires Online - a defunct MMO which somebody called Brendan Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-age-of-empires-online">rather liked</a>, an unreasonably long time ago. The studio have previously worked on projects for other companies, including Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - which I myself reviewed for Edge and found pretty unexciting - and Fortnite. Wartorn is their very first original project.
</p>
<p>
Did you play Myth: The Fallen Lords? It was one of Bungie's old joints, before they got into man-shooting. I remember being obsessed with the units who could dual-wield and being sad when I got them all killed. Hopefully, I'll be a better custodian for Wartorn's elf sisters. They seem pretty capable. Wartorn launches into early access in spring 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/">Steam</a> and the Epic Game Store (EGS storepage link to follow, once it's live).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
