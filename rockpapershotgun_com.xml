            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/q-up">Q-UP</a> might be gaslighting me. It most certainly is a real video game, I played it myself. And yet it presents an entirely different vision of reality where it is the coin flipping eSport of choice. The worst part is that it nearly convinced me that such a reality is a pretty good one. Perhaps even more than half!
</p>
<p>
Here's the strange lowdown. Q-UP is the latest game from Universal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paperclips">Paperclips</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babble-royale">Babble Royale</a> designer Frank Lantz through his family-run studio Everybody House Games. In it, you flip a coin, which the game describes as being the fairest of games because it is always a 50/50 chance that you will win. There are two teams, Q-Side, and Up-Side. Imagine you're on Q-Side for a moment, and the coin lands Q-Side up. It does that two more times and you've won, a first to three type deal. That's the game! And also it's not the game at all.
</p>
<p>
Q-UP is coated from head to toe in the aesthetics of something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. There are different heroes you can choose from with different skills that affect how much XP you earn, which is what the actual game is. You are trying to game the game so that you get as much XP as possible, whether you lose the coin flip or not, mixing and matching these skills so that they react with one another based on the results of the flip, or even just when the flip happens itself.
</p>
<p>
You can really rack up some XP too! I somehow managed to get over 200,000 points in one round, going up an entire rank in the game's demo, and let me tell you, the rush I felt was unlike anything any game that Q-UP is satirizing has given me before. I truly mostly don't care for games like Overwatch, the shooting just doesn't appeal to me and I don't like being called slurs by children even on a good day. But a game where I can just cut all of that out and get straight to the heart of it all, which is making number go up? That's a thing of beauty.
</p>
<p>
You can also genuinely play this game online, seemingly with strangers or your own friends. If that's not your bag there's a single-player option too.
</p>
<p>
Even in just its demo, Q-UP is a fascinating deconstruction of what makes eSports works, and also where it fails. Sometimes you'll have a match where you lose three flips in a row, and you'll get an email from the developer apologising for getting it wrong, offering you some currency to make up for it. Other times you'll spend 50 gold on the chance of pulling a literal whale, with the game outright telling you it's a 0% chance. And you'll do it multiple times anyway just to check.
</p><p>
Subtle, Q-UP is not, but it is genuinely fun, and somehow manages to capture that "one more game" quality that the best eSport games have. There's no release date for it just yet, though you can give it a go yourself by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730790/QUP/">checking out the demo on Steam</a>.

            <p>
I am genuinely unsure if MiHoYo are capable of making a game that doesn't heavily borrow from a different game you probably already love at this point in time. Denying The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's influence on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is like denying the sky is blue! Only recently was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> revealed, a game that takes Pokemon and shoves it into a blender with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/auto-chess">Auto Chess</a>. And now there is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/petit-planet">Petit Planet</a>, a game I can only describe as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but if it was in space, I guess.
</p>
<p>
There are a few differences between the Nintendo classic and MiHoYo's borderline wholesale ripoff. For one, the animal people feel much more akin to fursonas than just anthropomorphic animals. And there's the fact that, rather than living on an island like in AC: New Horizons, you live on tiny planets, of which there are a number you can visit.

<p>
It looks like there's a lot of customisation options too, from different clothes, to houses that can be built and interiors that can be designed. You can also visit other players' islands, go fishing, grow vegetables. Honestly, it's a bit hard to figure out just how different Petit Planet is from Animal Crossing aside from aesthetics. Which kind of begs the question, why does this even exist?
</p><p>
Well, the likeliest answer is that Animal Crossing: New Horizons was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52269671">removed from sale in China</a> following in-game protests performed by people in Hong Kong. That means there's a wide open market for a big budget game like that! For the rest of us, it looks like just more of the same thing you already like, but with a higher chance of getting more updates than New Horizons did. Congratulations to those of you that think games that don't need infinite updates should get them anyway!
</p>
<p>
In any case, if you are still curious about the game, and want to see if it truly is just an Animal Crossing clone, you can sign-up to beta test the game <a href="https://planet.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home">here</a>.
