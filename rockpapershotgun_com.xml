<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is, to the surprise of no one, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101">off to a bit of a flying start</a> (even if not everyone is completely in love with it just yet). I have no intention of diving into it just yet, in part because the solo experience doesn't interest me all that much, and I don't really want to be matched up with two other randos that would surely abandon me the moment I forget what my character can do. There isn't a duos option either, the thing I'm actually after, something that was a bit forgotten about during development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">but might be coming further down the line</a>. The power of modding always comes through however, as despite only launching yesterday, there's already a seamless co-op mod that allows for duos.

Aptly titled <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Seamless Co-op (Nightreign)</a>, those of you that have previously indulged in a bit of seamless co-op in other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslikes</a> won't be surprised to hear that it comes from none other than Yui. She made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">the original Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod a few years ago</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">Dark Souls Remastered one last month</a>.

Much like those two mods, this one allows you to play online with a friend without all of the usual faff you'll find in FromSoft's games, even if it is easier to play with others in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> than usual.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the mod is pretty simple. You can either create two or three player lobbies, and play online with them. Yui says that "there will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state." Don't worry about it banning you from regular online either, as it prevents your game from even connecting to any matchmaking servers in the first place. What more could you ask for!
