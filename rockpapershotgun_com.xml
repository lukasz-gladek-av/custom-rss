            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list. Now, Square Enix have added a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">dedicated 25th anniversary</a> page flogging figures, spectacles, and other charming tat to their website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s 25th cake day isn't until July 7th, but this new page <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097">lines up with claims</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a> leaker NateTheHate that we're getting closer to an announcement, if not a release. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-reportedly-real-and-happening-giving-hope-for-one-of-the-series-finest-to-finally-come-to-pc">has also claimed</a> that the Final Final Tactics remaster is still being worked on - a rumour that's been twinned with the FF9 one for about as long as it's been floating about.</p>

<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
