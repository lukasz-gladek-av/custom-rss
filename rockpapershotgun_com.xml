            <p>What <em>is</em> an indie game? Is a self-published game an indie game? Is a game with a small team size an indie game? Is it an indie game if it makes you go "oooo, haven't seen that before"? I got a letter this morning that made me feel slightly wistful but with undertones of mercurial optimism. Is the concept of post, therefore, an indie game? Are you ok? You're looking a bit pixelated this morning. Are <em>you</em> an indie game?</p>

<p>Was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave The Diver</a> an indie game? The 2023 Geoffrey H. Video Game Awards seemed to think so when it nominated the happy management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> for its 'best independent game' category. "Fie and fuckleberries on that!" came the response. "That's funded by Nexon! They're massive! Also, Nexon's Vice President even said "it may look like an indie, but it’s not necessarily so" in <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">an interview</a>. Case closed, Geoffles!"</p>
<p>The case was not closed. Much online out-loud thinking occurred. Thinkpieces fluttered from the sky like Yuletide's first crisp yellow snow. Then forty five full minutes passed and everyone forgot about it and started arguing about Ebert again.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>), Mintrocket CEO and Dave The Diver director Jaeho Hwang addressed 2023's hottest much-ado with a firm nope.</p><p>

"We did not intend for it to have an indie game feel" Hwang says, via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dave-the-diver-director-says-theres-nothing-indie-about-hit-game">NintendoLife</a>. "It's made by Nexon, so there's nothing indie about it".

</p><p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we’re developing games as a small team," he continued, "or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique. For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, ‘Hey, isn’t that a Nexon game?’, but it’s not like we applied for the award ourselves."</p>
<p>Hwang went on to point out how The Game Awards' nomination system works. Namely, that it's chosen by over 100 international games media outlets (not us, afaik) - devs and publishers can't submit games themselves. These parties aren't made aware of nominated games in advance either, Automaton point out. "Independent is a broad term" host Geoff Keighley said at the time. "It can mean different things to different people". As can <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">$250k for a minute of airtime</a>, presumably.</p>
<p>Anyway, my main feeling from back then hasn't changed: Dave The Diver is a great time regardless, and using games as cudgels to police arbitrary categories does them a disservice. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-gets-godzilla-dlc">It's got Godzilla in it and everything</a>. Phwoar. There's a big lizard if I ever saw one, our Godzilla.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dave-the-diver-director-finally-puts-2023s-silliest-debate-to-rest-no-its-not-an-indie]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Publishers Krafton have removed multiple senior staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds in a sudden shift that swaps the leadership team for a single head honcho from the studio who made sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. It's not clear why. At Unknown Worlds, co-founder Charlie Cleveland, CEO Ted Gill, and technical director Max MacGuire have all been "replaced" by Steve Papoutsis, CEO at Striking Distance, the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-ish game. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Papoutsis replaces the previous leadership team—Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire—effective immediately," said Krafton in <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">a press release</a>. "While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors."</p>
<p>Well, that's ominous. Papoutsis, the man being installed by Krafton, was an executive producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-3">Dead Space 3</a>. He became a higher-up on Callisto Protocol, the would-be spiritual successor to those spacey horror games, and eventually CEO of the studio, replacing Glen Schofield. I say "would-be" because the game famously ran like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">a stuttering jelly on an old train</a> when it came out on PC. </p>
<p>"I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the Krafton family," said Papoutsis, "and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the Subnautica community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience."</p>
<p>The decision is unexpected to say the least. Subnautica 2 is due to release some time this year into early access, and the studio has been increasingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-teases-new-creatures-and-co-op-among-the-coral">showing off its subaquatic setting</a> in developer blogs and promising <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-will-have-a-bigger-map-and-a-silent-protagonist-say-devs">a bigger world of wetness</a> than in previous games. Given such proximity to launch, the choice to suddenly boot several senior members of staff, including a founder who has been at the company for 24 years, shortly before the game is set to launch, is pretty wild. </p>
<p>It's not yet clear if other developers have also been laid off, or if this is a limited shake-up resulting from a long-term problem between developer and publisher. But none of it looks reassuring. I've reached out to contacts at Unknown Worlds for comment.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If there's one thing I love doing first thing in the morning, it's launching myself into a festively atrocious trench network, where gasmasks glare from the offal like toppled gargoyles, and sea mines dangle overhead like enormous germ cells. Here be monsters. Here be dropped diary pages. Here be a tormenting combo of "handcrafted" characters and permadeath. Here be, er, minigames.</p>
<p>"A grimdark machine for martyrdom, fed by flesh and devotion," is how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-hope-voiden">In Hope Voiden</a> describes itself. In this first-person survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>, you are 12 people in succession, each laden with baggage of one kind or another, each trying to make sense of a rusty hellmouth that marries the grot of World War 1 to the grain of PS1. It's the work of German team Stilbruch Games. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The retro aesthetics might sound tedious on paper. There are a lot of PS1-style horror games. But this one grabs me both for the density and peculiarity of its setting - is that a stained glass window, deep in the catacombs? - and for the ensemble format. "Each individual has a personal mission, unique traits, and only one life," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3726180/In_Hope_Voiden/">the Steam page</a> goes on. "Every action matters. Every failure lingers. When one life ends, another takes its place. The world remembers. The horror deepens."</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the pasts and motivations of the character in hand, you will also "discover the truth of a place where war broke reality". The blurb writing is perhaps a bit over-the-top in the non-World-War sense, though I absolutely don't have the right to complain about this after penning that line about the germ cells. Hopefully the in-game lore is sparser and subtler. Let those gnashing textures speak for themselves, I say.</p>
<p>You might expect the minigames to be a refreshing distraction from all the misery, a touch of match-3 to cheer you up when you're, I don't know, picking ghost shrapnel from your thighs. Fool! The minigames are all part of the plan! They are the grimdarkest bits of all!</p>
<p>"Lighting a flare. Bandaging a wound. Forcing a door. Enemies don't wait. Your mistakes cost you time. And time costs lives," summarises the Steam page. There also appears to be combat, or at least, there is a brief glimpse in the trailer of somebody firing a gun at something ghastly, but I'm not expecting this to be any kind of shooter. That gun is probably going to fill you with undeserved confidence and get you gnawed and despoiled by mutant trench rats.</p>
<p>Parallel-wise, I guess this is the lumbering, corner-peeking lovechild of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. It has no release date, only the ominous prediction that it is "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-torrid-trench-dimension-as-12-perma-killable-lost-souls-in-this-amnesia-style-horror-shooter]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We all have things we liked that we didn't realise were considered a bit naff at the time, and for me that thing was FMV games. Well, I win. FMV games are back and cool again. Which, by extension, basically means Dragon's Lair was good. I don't make the rules. Here's the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-take">Dead Take</a>.</p>

<p>You're looking for your mate Vinny in a mansion, following a big party. There's lots of red lights. A forlorn roomba bashes itself hopelessly against the wall. Someone's boarded up what looks like the elevator shaft. There's a private cinema. Maybe it's Quentin Tarantino's mansion. Maybe he boarded up the elevator shaft to stop whoever he was in the private cinema with escaping while he monologued, in his cocainiest voice, about 70's exploitation films for three hours. The mysteries pile up.</p>
<p>To put a slight damper on my grand proclamations re: resurrected genres, it does look like you can explore the mansion at your leisure without being ferried from one scene to another. The FMV-ness of it all comes in via acted scenes starring Neil Newbon (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, Resi Village) and Ben Starr (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur</a>). First person exploration <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> aren't exactly in short supply on Steam, and I'm naturally a bit sceptical over leaning on big names to elevate something otherwise plain, but without a creepy doll or lumbering followbeast in sight, I'm into what Dead Take is doing with its setting - more mystery than outright spookshow. You'll edit together video clips and solve puzzles to figure out what's happened here.</p>
<p>"The house is watching. It seems to haunt your steps. Piece together what really happened last night as you discover a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam Page</a>. "The cruelty. The sordid gossip. The auditions gone wrong. The shadowy figure with the power to make or break your career. There's only one way to guarantee your success: feed me something real".</p>
<p>It's from the Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU devs, Abubakar Salim's Surgent Studios. Salim himself is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqv5l6736qxo">no stranger to some of the nastier sides of working in entertainment</a>, another reason I'd bet on Dead Take being a fair bit more thoughtful than whatever Amnesia clone has popped up in my inbox for the day. It's also the first game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">being funded by Palworld devs Pocketpair</a>. This one's "coming soon", but you can play the seminal masterpiece '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227380/Dragons_Lair/">Dragon's Lair</a>' in the meantime.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-take-is-an-fmv-horror-with-midsomer-murders-ben-starr-and-casualtys-neil-newbon]]></content:encoded>
