            <p>A first round of hotfixes has arrived for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, following the Minecrafty sandboxer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-out-now-and-its-devs-are-advising-those-suffering-download-issues-or-errors-to-keep-plugging-away">arrival in early access</a> form yesterday. Developers Hypixel have also offered some insight into which aspects of it they're planning to prioritise working on in the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving right into <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">the note</a>s for this initial round of hotfixing, you'll naturally find a number of the "most critical" initial teething issues folks reported running into upon firing the game up for the first time. For example, you'll now get a warning if your computer's time is out of date, since this had caused some "authentication issues", with the launcher login process as a whole hopefully now less likely to serve you such errors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to setting up servers, Hypixel have added a message letting you know whether authentication is required after your server boots up and made sure you'll be automatically switched into offline mode if your online session runs into a hiccup which invalidates it. A number of crash causes have also been ironed out, including some caused by simply using buckets - that fix will require you to destroy and replace any workbenches which now aren't working as intended. Picking certain hair styles before doing your eyebrows in the character creator is another of these potential returners-to-desktop which have been dealt with.</p>
<p>Alongside delivering this round of initial fixes, as part of <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a longer post</a> celebrating Hytale's early access launch, Hypixel have offered a bit of insight into what you can expect them to be doing in the near future:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the first few months, we intend to deliver updates quickly and frequently, as there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites we need to tackle before we can move into larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences. The work on the official minigames will begin in the coming months, enabling us to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, we already have prototypes of social features, such as friend lists and proximity voice chat, in development. Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time!</p></blockquote>
