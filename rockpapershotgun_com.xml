            <p>The bit of reporting I'm about to relay to you probably isn't surprising, but it's worth making sure you've got a pillow on standby to scream into once you've digested it. Microsoft, they of more money than a company could ever need or know what to do with, have reportedly spent the last two years pushing Xbox to deliver profit margins which are well above the industry average. Cue all of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everwild-screenshots-leak-after-microsoft-cancellation-and-youd-seemingly-have-been-a-walking-garden-centre">cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">shutterings</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins">Bloomberg</a> have reported this profits push, which they cite as having seen company execs set an across-the-board goal of 30% profit margins, or "accountability margins" as they're known in Microsoft corpospeak. Not every individual game or project is expected to hit the 30% mark, but lots of developers across Xbox have been made aware of the target, the report claims.</p>
<p>The 30% goal reportedly came into force from autumn 2023, when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood's team took up a more prominent role, with Xbox moving away from a past which Bloomberg's sources claim wasn't as doggedly driven by financial metrics as the be all and end all.</p>
<p>To put the margin being aimed for in context, Bloomberg turn to data analytics firm S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, who put the average profit margin in the games industry at between 17% and 22% in recent years. Xbox's profit margins over the past six years are cited as has having landed somewhere between the 10% and 20% marks. According to S&amp;P analyst Neil Barbour, hitting 30% or more is "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it".</p><p>Along with the move we've already seen Xbox make towards cross-platform releases which aim to maximise the cash a game can bring in, rather than using it as a tool to try and tempt players onto Xbox consoles or Game Pass, the report cites sources as having pointed to an increasing risk averseness in terms of the games Microsoft green light as a likely consequence going forwards. Basically, if it ain't massive and dripping with clear cash-grabbing potential, it might not get made. Meanwhile, on the hardware front, that division's suggested to possibly be in line for "a significant rethinking".</p>
<p>It's a state of affairs you could guess pretty easily just by reading the tea leaves of the corp's moves over the past year and a bit, but damn if it isn't still depressing to have the unnecessarily greedy motivation behind it all reported in black and white.</p>

            <p>Ah Valve, you awful, giggling vultures. You terrible purveyors of mischief and misfortune. Weeks go past without you making any significant game-related announcements, and then you suddenly dropkick the entire Counter-Strike cosmetics economy into the sun.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The developers have released what they breezily call a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">"small update"</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> that, essentially, allows players to exchange five cosmetic items for other items that sell for a lot, lot more over the Counter-Strike player marketplace. As such, they have crashed the price of the latter items and, according to tracking app Price Empire, <a href="https://pricempire.com/app/trending?srsltid=AfmBOoo3OvDnG87yfdNDv23ZpJ1hS6jq81nUE6ogNh_gioHSJxewyddT">wiped billions of US dollars</a> off the value of the CS2 skins market.</p>
<p>As passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">Gamesradar</a>, the update in question extends the functionality of the 'Trade Up Contract', which allows players to swap common "Covert" items obtained from purchaseable cases for much rarer knives or gloves, including "StatTrakTM" gear that, as the name implies, tracks certain play statistics when equipped. </p>
<p>The Trade Up contract now lets people exchange five StatTrakTM Covert quality items for "one StatTrakTM Knife from a collection of one of the items provided", or five regular Covert items for "one regular Knife item or one regular Gloves item from a collection of one of the items provided". The result is that Covert skins have shot up in price, while the price of knives and gloves has plummeted. </p><p>The numbers in question are not tiny. They are in fact quite large. One Covert skin collector <a href="https://x.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834">says</a> that their 609 hitherto "worthless red skins" are now worth £3,329,612 on the marketplace. One respondent comments that "my knife just dropped $1,400 in value in the span of 30 minutes". </p>
<p>Reactions to all this on the Counter-Strike <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs2/comments/1odo9tw/this_update_has_made_some_collectors_very_rich/">subreddit</a> naturally vary quite a bit, with knife and glove collectors spitting mad, while others comment that this is great for new players who don't have the pocket money for a $400 make-believe dagger. Over at Forbes, Mike Stubbs <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/10/23/valve-just-crashed-the-high-end-counter-strike-skins-market/">speculates</a> that this is actually Valve's way of punishing knife and glove dealers for selling the items on external marketplaces, even at the cost of sabotaging the CS player cosmetics biz (from which Valve takes a cut) in the short term. I'll go ask the developers if they'd like to comment on all this.</p>

            <p>Two Ubisoft studios have announced plans to cut back staff, though one of them is trying to encourage people to lay themselves off in the form of "a voluntary career transition program". The studios in question are Ubisoft Massive - creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and Ubisoft Redlynx, creators of the multiplayer gadabout Trials biking games.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Yesterday, a Massive representative posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386779718370422784/">LinkedIn</a> that "[as] part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games.
</p>
<p>"To support this transition responsibly," the post goes on, "we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance."
</p>
<p>It's good that people are getting some apparently decent severance in return for realigning themselves into the rubbish bin, but that may not be much consolation for developers weighing the odds of future, involuntary layoffs on less favourable terms. Massive haven't specified how many roles they hope to cut, and at what point they will deem themselves to have been sufficiently "realigned". Quit now for a juicier leaving package, or stick around because you enjoy your job and thereby, increase the odds of being sacked down the road? 
</p><p>Massive haven't had a brilliant couple of years. Last year's Star Wars: Outlaws was much-hyped, as you might expect given that it's an open world game bearing the stamp of Lucas, but it proved to be merely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">"perfectly OK bit of Star War"</a> and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a "softer than expected" launch</a>. Its commercial struggles were a big factor in Ubisoft's decision to delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until they could be sure of doing the right numbers. Massive's current projects include Tom Clancy's The Division 3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced in 2023</a>. We've heard little about it since. The Division 2 was said to be performing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-restructure-as-creative-houses-as-q1-25-26-financials-come-in-lower-than-expected">"strongly"</a> in the company's most recent earnings report, but that's following Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">closure</a> of one of the game's support studios in January.
</p>
<p>All the above doom-mongering notwithstanding, the Massive people potentially affected are definitely in a happier situation than their colleagues at RedLynx. Ubisoft have <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">just announced</a> a "restructuring proposal" for the studio, to be thrashed out in collective negotiations with staff. Said negotiations primarily "concern the production and administration teams", and are all in the name of transforming Redlynx "from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens". 
</p>
<p>The post adds that Redlynx have "two unannounced mobile projects" in the offing, in addition to a technology team who work on Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. The proposal aims to trim the books by a maximum of 60 members of staff, and the negotiations are scheduled to run from October 30th till end of November.
</p>
<p>While the chief worry here is how many people will lose their livelihoods, I'm also saddened to hear that Ubisoft want Redlynx to shift away from PC and console, inasmuch as it means RPS will have less opportunity to write about Trials, a wonderfully daft party game.</p><p>It's of course noteworthy that neither Redlynx nor Massive appear to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a>, now called Vantage Studios, which is dedicated to Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six - regarded by Tencent as the juiciest parts of the Ubisoft pineapple. Anything that falls outside that core money-spinning operation appears to be more in danger of "realignment". In July, Ubisoft announced that they would reorganise the rest of their operation into "creative houses", with a view to being more "agile" and "focussed". Best of luck to all the rank-and-file devs mixed up in all this.</p>

            <p>Big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch alert. Seriously, it's massive. Dubbed the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, this behemoth boasts of having attempted to murder more than 200 bugs, alongside delivering some performance optimisation and gun balancing tweaks.</p>
<p>A healthy suite of changes indeed, and one that looks worth the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-need-just-a-smidge-more-time-for-that-next-helldivers-2-patch-promises-a-healthy-suite-of-optimisations">bit of extra wait</a>, assuming it does what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Arrowhead design director Niklas Malmborg and gameplay designer Lennart Holmgren dissect the Unjust: 4.1.0 update over the course of about a half hour in the video above, but we'll delve into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/538868565209514366?l=english">full notes</a>.</p>
<p>"This update focuses on what matters most right now: making Helldivers 2 feel better to play," they read. "We’ve overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us. That means more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most. Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. While new features are coming, this patch marks a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it. More refinements are already underway."</p><p>Outside of the fixes, it's worth reading through the mountain of gun balancing adjustments. Primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems should generally feel more effective, while SMGs and pistols have been specifically targeted with changes aimed at making them great in close-quarters fights, but less viable at long range.</p>
<p>How weapons with differing rates of penetration perform has also been looked into, with light penetration guns having been tweaked to "generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies" in an effort to set them apart from their medium penetration brethren. A bunch of enemies have undergone tweaks aiming to ensure you can effectively splatter them with both those levels of penetration. As part of that, the fearsome Terminid dragon roach has had its spawn rate decreased and can now be taken out by solely targeting its wings, which have been made more vulnerable to explosions and given their own health pool.</p>
<p>That's a quick rundown, but as I say, it's worth reading through the full thing if you're planning on dropping in soon. Here's hoping this effort Arrowhead are now putting into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">stabilising everything before ploughing ahead with more additions</a> pays dividends.</p>
