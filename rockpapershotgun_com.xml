Many are the minigames that threaten to be more entertaining than the games that host them, stealing the player’s attention away like those flatworms that absorb snails from the inside. Tetra Master. Gwent. Fishing in any number of RPGs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSSGZ9O8RX4">The flushable sinks in Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Or how about Space Harrier, which has only ever existed as an arcade cabinet offering inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, these minigames escape the host's body and become a standalone release. It’s not <em>entirely</em> true to say this of Dicealot, which is based on Farkle, a dice game you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-play-dice"> may have played</a> inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>For Farkle is actually a real medieval dice game that dates back to the 12th century, in which you roll six dice and score by achieving certain combinations. Dicealot takes a few liberties with the premise: it introduces a frame narrative in which Queen Gwynevere is trying to save a bewitched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>, together with additional power and quest dice, acquired from mission to mission, that modify the basic rules. It’s a roguelite, in other words. I know, we haven’t played a lot of those lately. Here’s a trailer.

There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035330/Dicealot/">a demo on Steam</a> if you’d like to give it a whirl. I am keen on the presentation: it’s like an illuminated parchment and a cathode-ray TV had a baby, and the baby grew up and dabbled in art deco. 
</p>
<p>
The developers are two-person outfit Goodviewgames, who are based in based in Leeds and Bordeaux. I was born in Leeds and still have family in Yorkshire. I assure you that I discovered this after viewing and enjoying the trailer. Let it be known, developers and publishers, that you will not automatically earn my interest if you happen to be based in Leeds. Though if you do want to relocate there and host some studio visits, it’d mean I could see my dad more often. Ball's in your court.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into To The Restless Ruins</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> dungeon crawler where you build the dungeon as you go. I really enjoyed the demo, and the full game is out today. In a show of confidence I always appreciate, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877770/Into_the_Restless_Ruins/">the demo is also still available</a>. Launch trailer below. It's got a quote from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stylish-roguelite-into-the-restless-ruins-channels-classic-warhammer-quests-dungeon-crawling">one of my articles in it</a>, although they opted not to use the phrase "like hailstones battering the word 'bum' into soft cement" for some reason. Perplexing times we live in.</p>

<p>Joining the word 'bum' in my demo preview was some thoughts on how the concept initially reminded me of the first iteration of tabletop dungeon crawler Warhammer Quest, which used a randomised tile deck to keep you guessing about the layout of your subterranean environs. Things work a little differently here: you'll be trying to reach a goal by constructing your dungeon from a deck you can add more cards to after each run. The runs involve autobattling, although you can finesse it somewhat with positioning.</p>
<p>I actually think the automatic combat is the sensible choice here, though, because you haven't got a map, and it keeps your brainspace free for navigation. As your layout gets more complex, you end up memorising routes and building in such a way as to allow you to scoop up more rewards. Maybe create a little enclave of healing rooms so you can batter enemies for longer? Maybe something more devious. Don't tell me. That'll ruin your chittering schemes, ratman. I wasn't actually sure if I'd missed the map, initially, so I mentioned it the article, and designer Tony Gowland replied. Who's quoting who now, Ant Workshop!</p>
<p>"There’s no map while you’re adventuring," wrote Tony. "This was deliberate so that keeping your dungeon memorable as you build it is another thing players have to factor in. It’s by far the most controversial design element and we’re really happy it landed for you".</p>
<p>It most definitely did. Into the Restless Ruins is currently £12/€13/$13 on Steam. Bum bum, bum bum. Bum, bum. Bum.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
