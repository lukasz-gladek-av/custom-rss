            <p>Starbreeze have cancelled Project Baxter, the co-op live service Dungeons &amp; Dragons game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game-on-the-way-from-payday-devs">announced back in 2023</a>. Part of the development team have been transferred to other projects with Starbreeze, while the remainder get to "transition to new roles across the industry".</p>
<p>Starbreeze have told us little about Project Baxter over the years, beyond characterising it as an action-adventure that reflects their "lifetime commitment" to  Games-as-a-Service, and stating that it would support PC and console crossplay. They announced it with a couple of artworks - one depicting a close-cropped mage in a cape, the other some pointy roofs and pennants. The game surely would have built upon Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-payday-2">established</a>, albeit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-sales-significantly-lower-than-hoped-but-starbreeze-focused-on-long-term-success">recently eroded</a> reputation for co-op heisting. Now, however, Starbreeze bosses have decided that doubling down on Payday is the safer route forward.</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," comments CEO Adolf Kristjansson in <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">a release to investors</a>. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p>
<p>Around 44 people, spanning employees and contractors, are to lose their roles at Starbreeze in the course of writing off Baxter. The press release adds that "the discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026." For context, cash-flow positive means you have more money coming in over a given period, than going out - it's not the same as being overall profitable. Starbreeze <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">made a huge loss in their financial year 2024</a> after a catastrophic launch showing for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. </p><p>Kristjansson ends the release by thanking the Baxter team and D&amp;D license owners Wizards of the Coast, adding that work on Baxter "will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze". Maybe they should give the laid-off Baxter team members a Special Thanks credit in Payday 4, assuming that's next on the agenda. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>Fortnite developers Epic Games have confirmed they'll be redeploying the 'Peaceful Hips' emote added to the battle royale as part of a crossover with superhero show Peacemaker, but with some modifications. This follows the dance being pulled from the game earlier this week, due to Epic's concerns about "creative intentions" in the aftermath of a big plot twist in the TV show.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your spoiler warning if you don't want to know about <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/peacemaker-twist-earth-x-prejudice">the Peacemaker twist in question</a>. Right, so one of the show's recent episodes sees protagonist Chris Smith, that's Peacemaker, discover that an alternate dimension he's been visiting is actually Earth-X, a version of Earth that exists in an alternate timeline which saw the Nazis win World War 2. Thus, America's a fascist state, right down to the flag having a big swastika on it. Cue a controversy, as some poses in the dance of Fortnite's 'Peaceful Hips' emote could suddenly be viewed as potentially resembling the shape of a swastika.</p>
<p>So, Epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842">opted to disable the emote</a> while they talked to Warner Bros. in order to investigate the "creative intentions" of the emote. The result was Warner Bros saying they didn't intend the dance to have any Nazi connotations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros.

<p>"We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline," a fresh tweet from Epic reads. "To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket."</p><p>It seems bizarre, given that the collaboration is so recent, that Epic wouldn't have been given some kind of heads-up about this potentially controversial twist in Peacemaker's latest season. While Warner Bros might not have anticipated that the twist would lead to such an issue for the game publisher, it's a definite failure in communication. We'll see if the situation leads to any changes in how Epic handles collaborations down the road.</p>
