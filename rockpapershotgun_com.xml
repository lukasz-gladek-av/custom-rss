            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.

            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>

            <p>
Golly, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a bit hard, 'ey? I'm not here to feed into that discourse right now, you've probably seen enough of that on Bluesky and in the comments of YouTube videos about the top 10 things you missed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>. No, instead I'm here to tell you that things could be much, much worse apparently, as it turns out an entire difficulty mode is hidden within the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> for you to unlock.
</p>
<p>
That might be music to the ears of those of you who are struggling a bit with the game (no judgement here, the game's tough). Unfortunately, this one isn't your tune, as the hidden difficulty mode actually makes the game harder, almost impossibly so. It's called Steel Soul mode, and the rules are pretty simple: "No reviving. Death is permanent." Great! Exactly what I want from a game where I've already died 10,000 times.
</p>
<p>
Unlocking the mode is, as discovered by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n8d1xc/cheat_code_discovery_not_joke/">Reddit user Buttnugtaster</a> (no relation), monumentally easy compared to the rest of the game. All you have to do is head into the Extras menu, then input the following: up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right. You'll get a flash on the screen, and if you try to start a new save file you'll find Steel Soul as an option. I've checked this myself and it does work, and no, I did not start a new save. My experience of this mode will be entirely limited to watching someone inevitably attempt it at Games Done Quick.
</p>
<p>
While there is no easy mode in the game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/teamcherry">Team Cherry</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">outline an upcoming patch earlier today</a> that promises to make a few bits of the game like a couple of boss fights a smidge more forgiving. At least those of us who beat Moorwing already have bragging rights.
