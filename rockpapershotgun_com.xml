            <p>Approximately 15 years, two months, and 14 days ago, Quintin Smith (RPS in peace) lobbed the headline '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/poker-night-at-the-inventory-released">Poker Night At The Inventory Released Today</a>' onto this fine site. On this day, February 5th - approximately 479,821,535 seconds further on in time - I'm here to tell you Poker Night At The Inventory is coming back, baby.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As poker nights at the inventory are wont to do, this one snuck up on all of us, with developers Skunkape Games suddenly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3897800/Poker_Night_at_the_Inventory/">revealing their hand</a>. They've got a remastered version of the 2010 card game which quietly vanished from Steam a little while ago, and it's set to come out on March 5th. Ah, bollocks, my hand's absolute trah and they've won the pot.</p>
<p>Oi, Heavy from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, Max from Sam &amp; Max, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, and Tycho from Penny Arcade. How did none of you have a strong enough hand to stop this newcomer from hoovering up all of our chips? They're not answering. They're just engaging in vaguely funny banter.</p>
<p>Anyway, this revamped version of Telltale Games' Texas Hold'em tussler boasts a totally rebuilt poker simulation designed to be "far more accurate" and have you opponents make decisions which better fit their personalities. It's also gotten "a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting". Finally, you can fiddle with some new knobs to tweak things like stating buy-ins and how much your fellow players talk.</p><p>Oh, and some of the Team Fortress 2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/poker-night-at-the-inventory-tf2-rewards">items you can unlock through playing Poker Night</a> have returned as part of this comeback. So, if you fancy nabbing the Iron Curtain minigun, the Enthusiast’s Timepiece watch, the Crimestomper Combo pistol/badge, or the Dangeresque, Too? sunglasses, you've now got another chance to do so.</p>
<p>If that's not a strong enough sales pitch, you can check out John Walker (RPS in peace)'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-poker-night-at-the-inventory">thoughts on the original Poker Night</a> from back in the day. "It's incredibly cheap, around £3, and that does make a really enormous difference," he wrote. "And it's animated really nicely, each character maintaining their unique style. But sadly, as funny as a lot of the lines definitely are, it doesn't last, and it doesn't have a workable poker game underneath it to make it worthwhile."</p>
