            <p>
"Where the hell did that goblin go?" asks a mean knight of some sort whose English accent is of questionable authenticity at the beginning of the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>. This is a reasonable question! When the goblin stealth game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goblin-stealth-gaming-returns-in-styx-blades-of-greed-out-in-2025-heres-the-first-trailer">revealed earlier this year</a>, it was slated for a 2025 release, except the rest of the year is in very short supply. So, this trailer acts as a double way: a confirmation of a delay, and the announcement of a proper release date.
</p>
<p>
Luckily if you love to be a little goblin that stealthily stabs folks, you've not got long to wait, as the game is now set to be released on February 19th, 2026, just over a couple of months away. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3290690/view/529864539779367425?l=english">Steam news post</a>, written from the perspective of the titular Styx himself, "the devs are taking a few extra months to polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking, and make sure my grand return is as glorious (and chaotic) as it deserves to be. A much more sharper adventure. One worthy of slipping back into my slightly grimy, perfectly stylish boots."

<p>
This is the first new Styx in a good few years, as the last entry in the series, Shards of Darkness, came out way back in 2017. That's as good as a lifetime ago! I must admit it's not a series I've spent any time with, though from writing this I've discovered that I actually own that second one on Steam. I'll assume that found its way in through a bundle of some sort given my total lack of memory over acquiring it, though it does feel quite appropriate given the sneaky nature of the games.
</p><p>
If you've never partaken in the ways of Styx, it takes place in developer Cyanide Studio's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-men">Of Orcs and Men</a> world. As Styx, you have to creep and crawl amongst the shadows using some fancy magical abilities to take down your foes. In Blades of Greed, it looks like you'll be able to do things like slow down time, use what is ostensibly a force push, or do some mind control to make a guy walk off the edge of a tall building and fall to his, well, you know. Morbid! But that's video games.
</p>
<p>
If any of that is up your alley, you can wishlist Styx: Blades of Greed on Steam ahead of its release next year.

            <p>
If a CEO says their company is going to do that something sounds ridiculously unrealistic, or borderline unachievable if you actually take a second to think about it, you can probably assume that this is for the ears of shareholders. With that said, CD Projekt Red recently held a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">financial call</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">IGN</a>), where co-CEO Michał Nowakowski made some comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>… and The Witcher 5 and 6, all of which are apparently planned to be released within a six-year period. Right!
</p>
<p>
To dig a touch more into that, Nowakowski specifically frame it this way: "[CD Projekt Red have] been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now, and we’re very happy with what we’ve achieved… and we’re happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."
</p>
<p>
He goes on to note that he believes further games should be released in quicker succession than in recent years (The Witcher 3 turned 10 this year after all, and even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is already five years old). And, as the developer has apparently claimed before, their "plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on."
</p>
<p>
I think it should be made quite clear that the intention to do something like this is very different from the practical reality of doing this. Insomniac Games admittedly achieved that with its Spider-Man games, but all three of them are set in the same map, and Miles Morales was much shorter than the other two, too. If The Witcher 5 and 6 were to do something similar, perhaps it'd be a different story, but with as big as CD Projekt games are, you should be taking this with several pinches of salt.
</p>
<p>
Both The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2 seem to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">chugging along well enough</a>, but they're both obviously still years out, so, we'll see how CD Projekt's plans develop.
