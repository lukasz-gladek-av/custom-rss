            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s great enhanced bossening has begun, with the first of the toughened up terrors FromSoft had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">previously teased</a> having just rocked up.</p>
<p>It's the Gaping Jaw boss, and it'll be followed by other Everdark Sovereigns in a time-limited weekly rotation of advanced adversaries for folks to test their mettle and friendships against.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Everdark-News">announced by FromSoft</a> at 6AM UK time today, June 19th, in what I assume to be a commendable effort to get everyone out of bed on a very hot Thursday, the Everdark Sovereign version of Gaping Jaw is now available to battle. That's assuming you've managed to defeat the base version of Gaping Jaw already. If not, you'll have to take that on as a pre-megajaw warm-up.</p>
<p>If you can beat enhanced Gaping Jaw, you'll get some Sovereign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens as a reward you can then trade in for "special relics and other items", with your first victory over each of these extra-resilient rivals netting you more tokens than subsequent wins. If you want an idea of what you're in for with this first time around, the sorts of streamers who specialise in beating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> with one health while doing a handstand and pressing keys with the power of their minds have already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWMWNVZB2YY">taken on the fresh foe</a>.</p>
<p>This initial crack at Gaping Jaw will run until June 26th at 1:59 AM BST, which is 20:59 on June 25th in ET, at which point enhanced Gaping Jaw will be whisked away, possibly to return at some point down the line. The enhanced versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight are next up in the rotation, with FromSoft adding that Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and Fissure in the Fog's Everdark Sovereigns will be arriving at a later date.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in order to take on these enhanced bosses, you'll need to launch the game in online mode, but it looks like modders may have already found a way to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/202?tab=description">make them available offline</a> as they arrive by swapping them for their regular counterparts. So, if you want to take them on using modded gear or as a twosome via the duos mod, you should be able to do just that.</p>
<p>If you'll be diving back in for your first expedition in a while, make sure to check out what the first few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-latest-patch-is-good-news-for-madness-fans-and-should-save-you-from-auto-death-after-boss-fight-revives">patches</a> for Nightreign have tweaked and our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">guides</a> if you fancy a refresher to help you get back up to top speed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I actually can't remember the last time I played a shmup. Maybe a Gradius? I don't know anything about ZPF's genremates or even what its name stands for, but I do know a good colourful big bastard turtle when I see one, and that was enough for me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095410/ZPF/">Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>"Great score!" Zam Pankman-Fried told me after I died 45 seconds in. From this, I learned that ZPF is a massive liar, but also that I actually quite like shmups still. Pretty compelling as far as avoid the bad thing 'em ups go.</p>

<p>There is/was/are going to be <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/pages/zpf">physical carts of this one available</a>, and while I appreciate the commitment to the 16-bit, I know where buying one physical game ends, and it ends with me buying so many I'm forced to start an unsuccessful retro gaming YouTube channel where I film myself in front of my heaving collection to adopt an air of legitimacy like a Netflix documentary trying to convince you to heed an MBA's opinion on magic mushrooms because they're sitting in front of a very large bookshelf. Steam suits my purposes fine for now. Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Inspired by classic horizontal shooters like Lords of Thunder, Elemental Master, and the Thunderforce series, ZPF is a passion project from the designer and developer of Super XYX and Tänzer.</li>
<li>Players will dodge and weave through intense bullet patterns, unleashing a barrage of firepower upon hordes of unique and challenging enemies.</li>
<li>Brace yourself for epic encounters with mid and end-stage bosses, each demanding a different strategy to defeat.</li>
<li>Upgrade your arsenal and gain valuable tips between levels at each of the world’s in-game shops.</li>
<li>Finish every stage and discover a treasure trove of hidden secrets.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say I really like how this one looks, even if I lack the language this morning to call it anything more precise than "colourful and cybery". Rainbow Geiger? Enlighten me, art style knowers. Reminds me quite a bit of <a href="https://hollow-press.net/collections/cyberflesh/products/cyberflesh-boardgame">Hollow Press's Cyberflesh</a>. Will I get good enough at it to see that turtle in the cyberflesh? Doubtful, but I'm motivated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
