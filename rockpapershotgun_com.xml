            <p>If you're having trouble getting into Minecraft, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or Sea Of Thieves right now, it might have something to do with a Microsoft outage that has taken services such as Azure offline. All three of the aforesaid games are <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/helldivers-2/">experiencing</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/sea-of-thieves/">spikes</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/">on</a> DownDetector.com, and there are reports of disconnections and failed logins on social media. The outage has also affected various possibly more consequential non-gaming things, such as airline bookings and banks. On the upside, it seems to have taken down Microsoft Outlook.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft appear to have identified what's broken. "We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue," notes an update, shared by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/live/microsoft-down-major-outage-hits-azure-365-and-more-even-minecraft-affected">Techradar</a>, who have set up a very excited liveblog full of words I don't understand. "We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and disabling a problematic route that we found to be related to this, and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.
</p>
<p>"We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to mitigate the portal access issues," the note from MS continues, filling my head with fractal visions of doors peeling away from doors. "Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly. We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update."</p>
<p>That message was from about 45 minutes before this post was published. If you can't access your Minecraft server now, I believe it's company policy that you are allowed to sneeze on Satya Nadella's lunch. It seems likely other online videogames are struggling besides those mentioned above. Let us know if you're having difficulty entering your preferred corner of cyberspace. Let us fill the comments thread with woe.</p>

            <p>Enough time has passed, and enough disappointment endured, that all I can remember of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a> series is a map's worth of landmine-throwing monkeys. It's possible this is an actual traumatic event from my youth, warped into a harmless videogame anecdote by years of cold water therapy and hypnosis. 
</p>
<p>We'll find out on November 23rd, when Cinder Interactive release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters Rewind</a> - a fan revival project that stirs together modes, maps, and story material from all three original TimeSplitters games. Oh look, they've published a trailer. Let's have a watch and see if it dredges up any additional explosive, hairy, hooting memories.

<p>Why, I recognise that electrozapper! I recognise those Tommy guns! Oh god, it was all real. They're coming for me! I hear them pawing and chattering at the windows. I hear them nibbling on sticks of dynamite in the pantry. I smell their hideous banana breath as I settle down to sleep. Save me! No wait, I was remembering a videogame after all. 
</p><p>A good videogame, even. Created by Free Radical and released back in 2000, TimeSplitters is basically GoldenEye but sillier and without the burdensome Brosnan component. It uses time travel and alternate dimensions as an excuse to slap a bunch of daft weapons, maps and characters together. The sequels changed little about this premise beyond adding extra daftness and, eventually, online multiplayer.
</p>
<p>The fan remake has been in development since 2012, having been given the greenlight by then-license owner Crytek, and now runs on Unreal Engine. The developers were in tough straits last year, putting out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-fan-remake-its-last-hope-after-free-radicals-demise-struggles-amid-incredibly-challenging-industry">call for help</a> as they sought to pack in material from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-2">TimeSplitters 2</a> and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. I'm not sure what's happened since, but they've evidently fared better than the creators of the official games. 
</p>
<p>Reporting on TimeSplitters in the years since Future Perfect has been perfectly torturous. Free Radical announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-4">TimeSplitters 4</a> in 2007, but then they went into administration in 2008, after a dismal response to piss-visor FPS Haze. Crytek subsequently bought Free Radical and rebranded them as Crytek UK. In 2011, it was reported that Crytek might revive TimeSplitters 4, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developers poured cold water on the idea in 2012, and eventually closed Crytek UK in 2014.
</p>
<p>A number of Crytek UK staff were transferred to Homefront devs Dambuster Studios, who somehow snuck <a href="https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378688148855795719">a full 4K remake of TimeSplitters 2</a> into their passable open world shooter Homefront: The Revolution. Then Embracer came along in 2018 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-timesplitters-game-from-deep-silver">bought the rights to TimeSplitters</a> via their Deep Silver label. In 2021, Embracer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-reformed-to-make-a-new-game">refounded Free Radical</a>, hiring back TimeSplitters co-creators David Doak and Steve Ellis. Then they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-could-close-days-before-christmas-embracer-exec-reportedly-confirms">closed it again in 2023</a> after their entire business went sideways for want of Saudi petrodollars.
</p>
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind will offer 28 maps, 50 arcade leagues, 32 challenges, 41 weapons (inc landmines), 20 arcade game modes, and 91 characters (inc monkeys). That's a lot of game. Congratulations to all at Cinder for seeing it through.</p>

            <p>Ring ring. Ring Ring. Ring ring. The stern and bespectacled manager of Blake Manor's hotel appears for the eighth time. You're looking a bit narked there mate, I, the investigatorman, observe. Yes, he says yet again, I'm a bit stressed and busy on account of our telegram machine having gone kaput. Makes sense, I reply, can't think of any other reasons why you might be pissed off. He shuffles back into his office for exactly five seconds. Ring ring.</p>
<p>You're being haunted in the demo for spooky detective puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a>, which released in full earlier this week, having had a demo up on Steam for a good while. However, I can confirm having taken in the first night of that demo that you're also give the power to do the haunting yourself.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me as the intro sequence played were the Dracula vibes. You're not off to Transylvania, but the year is 1897 and private investigator Declan Ward is on his way to a remote manor in Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. He sits in a carriage examining the letter sent to him by an anonymous client, his brow furrowing in the way that only the brows of gothic horror protagonists can furrow.</p><p>He arrives at the manor and is greeted by pale stone walls amid a thunderstorm, because spooky tales like this are contractually obligated to lean into moody weather whenever possible. I jest, as for all its conventionality, the bit of Séance of Blake Manor I've played is a beautifully rendered and assembled love letter to classic spookage. Your first task is to work out whether the girl you're seeking, Evelyn Deane, has actually left the building.</p>
<p>To get there, you'll need to examine objects, quiz people, and gradually string together enough evidence to put together a hypothesis. Think something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>, but a bit less unorthodox in terms of styling. Signs up hint that a séance is being hosted at the hotel and I'm sure neither that nor the ghostly figures I keep seeing hint at anything remotely concerning going on round these parts.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've distracted myself by relentlessly pressing the hotel desk bell to summon the manager. I need to get a move on, because each little bit of investigating takes time off the clock, and you only get an hour of in-game time to solve this first mystery. Fine, I guess I'll do something useful and ask him about the creepy statue outside this time. Ring Ring.</p>

It is more than commonplace these days for games to get some kind of delay, in fact it's surprising when the big boy names don't get one, like, say, GTA 6, which was meant to be out this year, but got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">pushed to 2026</a>. But it's rare that most games take more than 13 years to develop, an amount of time which retrofuture moonbase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> did in fact take. Except now its release is right around the corner!
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes, I know, you'll believe it when you see it, but as it currently stands developer Lunar Software says that the game is slated for release this coming December 4th. That's just over a month away, as long as the way calendars work hasn't changed since I started writing this, a closeness that would make it surprising if the game received further delays. So, perhaps you'll be able to actually experience the game for yourself by the end of the year!

If you've not heard of Routine before, it's one of those survival horror games, one where you explore an abandoned moonbase. There's mysterious, quite creepy robots that want to kill you (of course!), puzzles to solve (of course), and an aesthetic based around the idea of what the future might have looked like from an '80s perspective (of course?).
</p><p>
It took so long to make in part because the devs simply couldn't work on it for a while, both for financial reasons and a general unhappiness with where it was going. Routine did get a re-reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retrofuturistic-moonbase-horror-game-routine-is-actually-still-coming">back in 2022</a>, now with added support from publisher Raw Fury, with a couple of engine changes mixed in somewhere amongst the decade and a bit development period.
</p>
<p>
Doom 2016 composer Mick Gordon also worked on the soundtrack, but he did leave the project in 2024 due to scheduling issues - a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/582778112589168937?l=english">recent Q&amp;A</a> explained that since that point the audio and audio implementation is being handled by "other people."
</p>
<p>
I do quite vibe with the aesthetic Routine offers up, I have quite a distaste for that clean, shiny look you see so much of in sci-fi these days, and retrofuturism always has that bit of texture I crave. But, well, it did take 13 years to make, so I have some reservations! Good thing I only learned about it from the re-reveal, so I don't have those 13 years of expectations like some of you might. On that note, good luck, Lunar Software!
