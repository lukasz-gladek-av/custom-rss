            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have yet again managed to pull off something remarkable. You know how creating patches to ensure two mods work together smoothly's long been something that requires firing up the likes of the creation kit or xEdit? Well, thanks to a new mod dubbed the in-game patcher, it's possible to resolve issues like that simply by wandering up to the location as the Dragonborn and editing the very make-up of the world.</p>
<p>See a rock clipping through a house because you've downloaded a couple of works that give the same bit of Whiterun a makeover? Just mosey over, grab the misbehaving mineral, and either move it elsewhere or delete it. You'll have make sure you've not messed up anything else in the process before you save your changes, but assuming all the NPCs still have their own heads, you've got your own patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder behind this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158681?tab=description">in-game patcher</a> is RavenKZP, whose previous projects include some equally advanced stuff. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101364">Adding seasons</a> to the new areas added to the RPG by the likes of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and a mechanic that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113658">makes food go mouldy</a> if you keep it in your pockets too long. They've also made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125890">a quest</a> involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s Uncle Sweetshare, which earns them a million extra points in my book.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of me curiously nerding out. This in-game patcher, originally spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-mod-conflict-fix-in-game-patche-nexus-mods/">TheGamer</a>, is a plugin for Skyrim: Special edition's script extender. Once it's installed, you enter and exit a patching mode by opening and closing the game's console, where you typically enter the likes of spawn commands.</p><p>Once open, you select objects as you usually would in the console, and can move, rotate, scale, or remove them as you see fit. Markers, such as spawn points and those which control the likes of idles, furniture interactions, and which way water flows can also be manipulated in the same fashion. You can also add keywords to items if you're so inclined. There are a bunch of quick YouTube tutorials under the mod page's video tab to help you get started.</p>

<p>RavenKZP wrote that their creation can also be used simply to rejig the world clutter to your liking or do a bit of redecorating of houses, cities and the like, which'll probably be what I try first if I give it a whirl. Once you've made your tweaks, they can be saved as "BOS/KID patches so they persist across game sessions" and shared with others in ini file form. The modder's also got plans to keep expanding what their work can do going forwards, including adding the ability to edit multiple objects at once.</p>
<p>As you might imagine given what it pulls off, the in-game patcher does come with a pretty chunky list of requirements - the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim script extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444">Address Library for SKSE Plugins</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123664">Object Manipulation Overhaul</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352">SKSE Menu Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148703">SkyPrompt</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805">Base Object Swapper</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456">Debug Menu</a>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13090">Jaxonz Positioner Converter Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250">More Informative Console</a> are optional extras.</p>

            <p>Gearbox and Take-Two Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched to cries of "pretty good" from (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">some</a>) professional reviewers, and "Stutterland bugfest" from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">a vocal portion of the Steam playerbase</a>. In amongst the complaints about performance, there are some fears about potential breaches of player privacy supposedly allowed for by Take-Two's terms of service. A Borderlands developer has now responded to these fears in the Steam forums, reiterating that Take-Two at large aren't in the business of "spyware".
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/">the statement on Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service.
</p>
<p>"Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations," it goes on. "Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience."</p>
<p>The statement gives a couple of examples of more innocuous data collection, such as sponging up player and device identifiers to ensure compatibility with platforms, or making usernames visible to other players, together with more ambiguous practices like gathering data "to better understand how players play games".</p><p>Take-Two have been caught deploying some pretty 
insalubrious data collection software in the past. As reported by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2018, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> once made use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-vi-removes-red-shell">Red Shell software</a> to track certain system data, in a bid to identify whether people who've clicked on adverts for games then proceed to buy them.
</p>
<p>The Steam statement also seeks to clarify Take-Two's policy towards mods, noting that they "prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to", but do not "generally" take action against mods "that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties." I'm not that familiar with the Borderlands modding scene, but Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somebody-recreated-all-of-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-gta-5-aaaaand-its-gone">have a legendarily iffy relationship with GTA modders</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">Perignon Champagne Gamer</a>, the concern about Take-Two spyware dates back at least to May this year, when a Youtuber video about <a href="https://www.take2games.com/privacy/en-US/">the publisher's recently revised TOS</a> sparked a short-lived uproar.</p>
<p>I do not want to hand over any of my data to any particular large corporation, myself, but I have to say, I don't see anything in that TOS that strikes me as out of the ordinary, for better and worse. Suspicion is the appropriate response to such things, but exaggeration helps nobody. I've read a few comments that assume that Take-Two are automatically hoovering up everything mentioned in the list of possible data types collected, the second you boot up a game, rather than when you deliberately opt into certain services, such as Borderlands 4's irritating SHiFT service for cross-play.</p><p>I am adding "interview somebody to do a proper explainer about data collection practices and privacy" to our endlessly extendable, usefully hypothetical Long Term Features trello. While we're at it, we could look into related anxieties about anti-cheat and DRM, which have recently resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call Of Duty and Battlefield requiring that you enable secure boot on PC</a>.</p>
<p>The TOS aside, some Borderlands 4 players are concerned about the game's usage of two types of digital rights management - the infamous Denuvo software, which has been cited by a few of the reviews that mention launch performance problems, with proprietary Symbiote software stacked on top. We interviewed a Denuvo executive last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-respond-to-their-rep-for-tanking-games-im-a-gamer-myself-and-therefore-i-know-what-im-talking-about">about their reputation for tanking games</a>.
</p>
<p><em>This article has been updated to mention Civilization 6's use of Red Shell tracking software.</em></p>

            <p>You're gonna have to wait a bit longer to murder the steeple for a second time, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-ii">Slay The Spire II</a>'s early access release having just been delayed until March next year. Developers Mega Crit have at least cushioned the blow by revealing the day of the week it'll arrive. A Thursday. Which Thursday? The cheeky folks won't say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After a lot of internal discussion, we've made the call to move Slay the Spire 2's Early Access launch to a secret Thursday in March 2026," Mega Crit wrote in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829?l=english">September newsletter on Steam</a>. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!) Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time."</p>
<p>"There's no single dramatic reason," they added. "Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Thus follows a brief Q&amp;A section in which the studio ruled out some theories about the delay folks might have had, such as it being yet another product of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s launch gobbling up a huge amount of attention. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong’s date was announced," Mega Crit community manager Demi wrote. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>They did acknowledge that adding a lot more new stuff to the formula established by the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> is part of the impetus for the change, but made clear this sequel shouldn't become a game that gets "repeatedly delayed with no explanation". "For one thing, you should never expect radio silence from us," Mega Crit explained. "That’s why we’re here talking to you now. And, as opposed to a general release year, we have an actual specific date that we’re aiming for internally and are confident we can hit this time."</p>
<p>With that out of the way, the devs teased another of Slay the Spire 2's new features, alternate acts. Basically, once you unlock it, when you enter a new act over the course of your run you can trigger a choice between two paths with different environs and foes. The example given is one route offering "a lush, tangled ruin with much of its fauna resembling mystical woodland creatures and sentient flora that might just eat you alive", while the other's "a miry waterway connected to the Spire's sewer system, from which all manner of mutant sea creatures and vagrants might emerge".</p>
<p>The game won't launch with all of the planned alternate acts in place, with some set to arrive down the line as part of early access updates.</p>
<p>If you've not given the original Slay the Spire a go, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review">RPS founderperson Alec Meer's review</a> of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikey</a> deckbuilding. The strapline reads "a miracle of design", so I think it's fair to assume his thumb was pointed skywards.</p>
