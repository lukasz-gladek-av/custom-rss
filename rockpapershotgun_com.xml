Whether or not we'll be getting any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> somewhere along the line is still very much up in the air. But if we do, it seems it won't be under the leadership of Carrie Patel. In a quick post Patel shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-patel-80003aa_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7330425052565307393-bTzY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">LinkedIn</a>, the game developer shared that she's "starting a new position as game director" at the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxenfree">Oxenfree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/night-school-studio">Night School Studio</a>. Patel mentioned literally zero details outside of what her new role is, so it's not even clear why she left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/obsidian-entertainment">Obsidian</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This'll likely have been in the works for a little while, as Night School were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/night-school-studio_were-hiring-we-are-adding-a-few-new-folks-activity-7307830962854248448-9Pm_?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABpdx_8Bp2SwTs04t6viV8z8sBm7M5FTm_w">specifically looking for a game director in March</a>. As a reminder, Avowed only came out this February. It also paints a slightly confusing picture for Night School themself. Earlier this year it was reported that an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of workers were being laid off</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Things have been a bit quiet at the developer since they released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals back in 2023, having not made anything original since then either. They did make a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a> tie-in game called <a href="https://x.com/nightschoolers/status/1910396546774127091">Thronglets</a>, a game featured in the most recent season of the anthology show (in case you forgot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-have-bought-the-developers-of-oxenfree">Netflix bought the studio way back in 2021</a>).
</p>
<p>
Here's hoping Patel and co. get to make something original again. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netflix">Netflix's</a> approach to gaming has been a bit all over the place, ranging from mobile titles, to AAA, but none of it has worked in the way the streamer has found success with film and TV. Their main AAA studio, Team Blue, which included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Halo, and God of War talent, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">shut down last year</a>, so more than anything I hope the same fate doesn't await Night School anywhere down the line.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red's</a> sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is mostly a bit of a mystery, and it likely will be for a while yet given that they're currently full steam ahead on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. We know Anna Megill, who worked on Control and the upcoming Fable game, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">attached as lead writer</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">team wants to deal with some big topics</a>, but there's been nothing like plot details shared so far. At the very least, Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith shared some tidbits about it at Digital Dragons, namely to do with the game's map.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pondsmith explained that with the sequel, he's "not as involved directly," but he does get to look at the scripts of the game. "Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’" 
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64XD2DtKU64" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
In terms of things he shared about the game itself, Pondsmith explained that he "spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place… because there’s another city that we visit, and I’m not telling you anymore than that, but there’s another city that we visit. Night City is still there." He went on to say, "I remember looking at it and going, ‘I understand the feel that you’re going for, and this really does work, it doesn’t feel like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong’. And I said, ‘yeah, I can see this working’."
</p>
<p>
I'm going to assume that he probably isn't even meant to say as much as he's said here, but he's also the literal creator of the world of Cyberpunk, I think we can cut him some slack.
</p>
<p>
Based on Pondsmith's comments, we'll be able to roam around Night City once more alongside this new, Chicago-like city. Smart thinking, honestly. I know people complained about how Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom just used the same map again, but if you ask me it expanded and changed it in some pretty interesting ways. 
</p>
<p>
The Yakuza series repeatedly used the same locations too, not only working well as asset flips, but as a narrative tool too. I don't even like Cyberpunk 2077 all that much, but I'd still be curious to see how Night City changes between games. I'm sure we'll get some idea of what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be like in, hmm, at least seven years? Yeah, that sounds about right.

Alright, so, I know those of us on PC haven't even had the chance to play the first one yet, but it seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> have essentially confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> 2 is in the works. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/">Insider Gaming</a>, Shift Up recently shared its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">investor relations presentation</a> for May of this year, most of it being businessy nonsense neither you or I could give two tosses about. The key thing is a slide in its strategy section, showing a very basic plan for its games Nikke and Stellar Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On Stellar Blade's section, it shows a label titled "platform expansion", presumably in reference to that upcoming PC port. There's also a bit that just plainly says "sequel", which, I don't know about you, certainly implies that a sequel is likely to be in the works. This section also shows that all of these steps are being taken between 2024, i.e. the original release year of Stellar Blade, and 2027, seeming to suggest that Shift Up plan to release a sequel by then.
</p>
<p>
On top of that there's the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studios-next-game-reportedly-aaa-action-rpg-titled-project-witches">previously reported Project Witches</a> listed, also seemingly due out before 2027. Not many details on that one still, but it appears to be early days still as another section notes that there's only 18 people working on it currently compared to the 107 devs working on Stellar Blade, and 148 devs working on Nikke. Worth noting this might have changed by now, as these figures are as of March 2025, either way, you probably shouldn't expect a proper reveal of that for a while.
</p>
<p>
Whether the sequel comes to PC whenever it launches, I couldn't tell you, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game is due out for us in less than a month. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">You'll be able to pick it up on PC on June 11th</a>, though not necessarily everywhere, as it's currently region locked. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blades-devs-would-like-you-to-know-you-dont-need-a-psn-account-on-pc-as-they-work-on-the-region-lock-problem">Shift Up is working on fixing that at least</a>!
