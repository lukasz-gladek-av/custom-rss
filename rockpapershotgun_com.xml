How does one come up with, and subsequently make, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>? Well, it sounds like you just kind of have to do it in weird ways. If you've missed it, Peak isn't just slang you've heard your teen use to denote something being really good, it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">co-op</a> video game about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">climbing mountains with your friends</a> and having a very good/ bad time while doing so. The bulk of work was also done in a single month as part of a collaborative game jam between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer Landfall. And in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/">PC Gamer</a>, a couple of the devs that worked on Peak have shared a little insight into how it got made.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Aggro Crab head Nick Kaman, Peak was made "mostly from jealousy." To be clear this sounds like mostly a joke, but for Kaman and the rest of Aggro Crab, this feeling came about when they learned that Content Warning was also made as part of a one-month long game jam, and sold ridiculously well. "It turned everything we know about game development upside-down," Kaman said.
</p>
<p>
"At the time we were on the precipice of launching our biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure—an intense 3+ year-long project that burnt a lot of us out. While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in MUCH less time." So, Kaman and two other devs at Aggro Crab asked if they could join Landfall for their next jam, conducted in Korea, the latter said yes and off they went.
</p>
<p>
"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks (that were donated to the local indie scene at the end of the month)."
</p>
<p>
Peak itself had actually been pitched the year prior… in a hot tub in Sweden, of all places, said Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that."
</p>
<p>
After that, all their time in Korea was spent either working on the game, or "getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman said. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I’ve ever had working on a game."
</p>
<p>
While sales are absolutely not an indicator of quality by any means, <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">Peak has since gone on to sell a boatload too</a>. I mention only to point out that this doesn't mean the key to success is starting with a good idea and then only taking a month to make it. Both Aggro Crab and Landfall are experienced developers, so I beg of you, don't point to this as an example of a quick route to success.

            <p>There's no way I'm learning this for the first time after ten or so years of people exploring every nook and cranny of this game. That's the thought that went through my head when I spotted a tweet from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> quest designer Philipp Weber earlier this month, revealing that one of the Blood and Wine DLC's quests had a secret cut epilogue.</p>
<p>I've played quite frankly far too much of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> over the years, and I'd never heard of it. Of course, I'm just one bloke, and hardly an endless encyclopedia containing every single bit of trivia about a decade old game. That's when I raked through the internet, and couldn't find any mentions of the cut epilogue. Surely Weber hadn't kept this under his hat for about a decade, not even mentioning it when folks found what he'd called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZZ9p1HbeHs">"last secret"</a> by investigating the exact same quest. Er, yes, he had.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, I'll give you the context. The tweet from Weber that started off my wild goose chase came in response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l7uk19/fun_fact_vivienne_from_blood_and_wine_has_a_mom/">a Redditor</a> discovering cut models for Vivienne De Tabris' parents while digging around in TW3's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-redkit-mod-tools-launch-may-21st-enabling-a-new-era-of-ambitious-overhauls">REDkit modding tools</a>. For a refresher, De Tabris is the cursed lady-in-waiting from the quest 'The Warble of a Smitten Knight'. It's the one where Gerry takes part in the knightly tournament and you're about to read some spoilers for it.</p>
<p>Cue Weber posting that "originally the Warble of a Smitten Knight used to have a flashback scene where we would see Vivienne's parents at the pond, being watched by a nymph who was envious of their love. She was the one who cursed their unborn baby, setting the whole story into motion.</p>
<p>"We used to have a secret quest epilogue in which you could find this nymph, but had to cut it due to scope," he continued, "However, we were able to reuse the nymph's model for the Lady of the Lake and add her to the quest for Aerondight. Originally, she was not even supposed to be seen."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This post shows a nice example of how cut content can sometimes also be a good thing. We lost Vivienne's parents, but gained a Lady of the Lake. <br>Blood and Wine for the Witcher 3 was a huge expansion, but to make it we still had to cut some scope.<br>(1/3)<a href="https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9">https://t.co/XJz4bIFOr9</a> <a href="https://t.co/28vfghTDpy">pic.twitter.com/28vfghTDpy</a></p>— Philipp Weber (@PhiWeber) <a href="https://twitter.com/PhiWeber/status/1932419237714526465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Very cool, but not just that. An answer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdKNtepEt0o">the debates</a> some Witcher fans have been having for years about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1ekqcv0/witcher_3_the_identity_of_the_creature_who_cursed/">the identity of the nymph</a> that cursed Vivienne, with some having speculated that Hearts of Stone baddie Gaunter O'Dimm or one of Velen's crones could be behind it.</p>
<p>And not something that, as far as Weber knows, was public knowledge prior to him tweeting about it on a Tuesday more than nine years on from Blood and Wine's release in May 2016. "I never revealed the secret," the current Witcher 4 narrative director told me yesterday in response to my reaching out to him the day the tweet appeared in our lives, "but after the 10th anniversary and since people found the models already, it felt like an appropriate time!"</p>
<p>It goes to show you, TW3 really is a gift that just keeps on giving. I look forward to learning for the first time once ten more years have passed that Geralt's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/witcher-3-mod-geralt-centaur-horse-man">secretly a horse man</a> while he's saving the world from the Wild Hunt.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-witcher-3-dev-kept-mum-about-a-secret-blood-and-wine-quest-epilogue-for-nearly-a-decade-until-someone-dug-up-some-cut-parents]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Upcoming park management/unethical science sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> will no longer feature generative AI. Publisher-developers Frontier Developments had previously disclosed that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-strongly-feel-this-ai-powered-demo-of-quake-2-is-an-insult-to-life-itself">oft-rubbish</a> technology would be used to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3s-low-system-requirements-spoiled-by-mention-of-ai-generated-scientists">create scientist portraits</a> for your uneaten staff. That disclosure has now vanished from the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>, with the removal of the genAI material confirmed outright in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-using-generative-ai-for-scientist-portraits-following-initial-feedback">Game Watcher</a>.</p>
<p>"We have removed the use of generative AI for scientists' portraits in Jurassic World Evolution 3 following some initial feedback," reads the statement. "The team are continuing their diligent work on the game and are very much looking forward to launching on 21 October."</p>

<p>"Initial feedback" presumably means complaints, be they from dev staff, otherwise eager fans, or the naysayers at so-called games websites like Rock Paper Shotgun. In any event, it’s hard to imagine the algorithm-birthed researchers being especially missed; this was always a strangely specific field of artwork to turn over to an AI assembly line, especially when Evolution 3 is making the effort to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/volution-3-brings-baby-dinosaurs-with-it-this-october">model and simulate the life cycle</a> of several dozen different dinosaur species. That’s the kind of proudly nerdish attention to detail that management enthusiasts love! Why was that doable, but drawing some people in labcoats wasn’t?</p>
<p>Still, credit to Frontier for returning fully to their artistic ways. And, to be fair, for being upfront and particular about how they’d initially planned to use genAI in the first place. Steam’s disclosure system is supposed to inform and empower players as to whether or not to support games with AI-generated material, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">as Call of Duty demonstrated</a> earlier this year, publishers can still get away with submitting only vague claims about the extent of their usage.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/justice-for-faces-as-jurassic-world-evolution-3-drops-its-ai-generated-scientist-portraits]]></content:encoded>
