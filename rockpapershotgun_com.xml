            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel has shed its Project Orion codename and will now be known as... Cyberpunk 2. CD Projekt revealed the name change in their <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">latest earnings results</a>, according to which the new Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has just entered pre-production - roughly defined, the point in a game's gestation when designers, artists, programmers and so forth meet to flesh out the concept, but before they've actually started making anything that's supposed to form part of the finished game. There are now 96 people working on the thing, versus 422 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, 49 on multiplayer Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and 19 for an unannounced original game, Project Hadar.</p>
<p>The grousing, dilettante reader will object that this is scant material for a news post, especially given that CD Projekt are offering no guarantees that "Cyberpunk 2" will be the project's final name - as they commented to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">Verge</a>, Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe." But the dextrous maven of online news-mongering will notice that "Cyberpunk 2" is, in fact, an extremely compact and subtle piece of worldbuilding.</p> <!--more-->
<p>After all, Cyberpunk 2077 is set in the year 2077 CE. By logical extrapolation, Cyberpunk 2 is set in the year 2. Combine that with a hint from Cyberpunk tabletop creator Mike Pondsmith that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-will-see-you-return-to-night-city-and-head-to-a-new-city-described-as-chicago-gone-wrong">nu-Cyberpunk will take place in Chicago</a>, and we can make deductions about Cyberpunk 2's setting by copy-pasting bits of this randomly googled <a href="http://livinghistoryofillinois.com/pdf_files/Timeline%20of%20Illinois%20History.pdf">Living History Of Illinois</a>, with its trust-inspiring emblem of a sickly and loquacious bald eagle attempting to disentangle itself from a discarded shield.</p>
<p>Here is what the nauseous avian scholars of the Living History of Illinois think occurred in the years 500 BC to 900 AD: maize agriculture, village-building, burial mounds, pottery, and the invention of the bow and arrow. That's pretty much a video game, right there. But is it a Cyberpunk game? I have now completed a forensic control+F search on that PDF several hundred times, and can disclose zero mention of "ripperdocs", "braindancing", or "taxi missions that are secretly better than the main storyline". If the indigenous peoples who lived on the banks of what would later be called the Mississippi River had access to aerodynes and quickhacking, they kept it on the down-low. Possibly instead of aerodynes they had barfing bald eagles.</p>
<p>CD Projekt have yet to explicitly confirm anything about the new Cyberpunk's setting, beyond saying that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">want to explore problems like homelessness and the wealth gap</a>. I'd email them a link to this report, asking for a statement, but I love CD Projekt like my very own children, and do not wish to encumber them with some abject nonsense. You, on the other hand, are welcome to leave a comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've never been so happy to see a spike trap as I was in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/debugging-hero">Debugging Hero</a>. At the start of each combat encounter, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406850/Debugging_Hero/">the demo</a> for this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> hack n' slash hands you several numeric cards and lets you pause the game to view both your and your enemies' stats: health, damage, and durability. You then drag the cards on to the relevant stat to modify it, then unpause to continue real-time combat.</p>
<p>It's a cute gimmick, letting you knock down high health enemies to a manageable number, or kill weak ones outright, or heal yourself. But it felt a tad shallow to carry a whole game, even one with dodges and parries in its real-time combat. Then, I entered a room with a trap tile that thrust sharpened spikes upwards at timed intervals, and realised I could manipulate the timer. I tuned it right down, and raucously chortled like a portly racoon at the bakery bins as it pneumatically skewered my idiot attackers.</p>

<p>When I fought the first boss, I noticed I could also slow down his attack intervals, letting me poke with relative impunity for long stretches. You can also mess with projectiles like arrows, slowing them down or reducing their damage. Whether Debugging Hero stays interesting is definitely going to rely on how many new ideas it introduces past the demo - even then, I don't think it's going for something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>'s depth. But, being the Adorno to Edwin's Benjamin in the seminal Marge Simpson School Of Potato Critique, I am compelled to award Debugging Hero our most prestigious accolade: it's neat. The game's out tomorrow, May 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In 2023 EA opened a new studio named Cliffhanger Games, led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, and announced a new third-person, singleplayer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-and-marvel-announce-a-black-panther-game-set-in-wakanda">starring Marvel's Black Panther</a>. They've now cancelled that game and shut down that studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN report</a>.</p>
<p>According to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, via an email sent to employees, this has been done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Additionally, both EA's mobile and central teams will see an unconfirmed number of layoffs - understood by IGN to be less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">the 300 workers laid off in April</a>. From the report:</p>
<blockquote>"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.</blockquote>
<p>EA are reportedly making efforts to find affected workers other roles within the company, via an internal placement programs. "Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues," Miele told IGN, while also saying in the original email that EA would be focusing on Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> going forward.</p>
<p>EA employees were left "upset and confused" at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">return to office mandate</a> earlier this month. In-person work, said CEO Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, leads to "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players". Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">EA laid off 5% of their workforce</a>, (around 670). Despite these recent layoffs, the company now employs 800 more people than this time last year, <a href="http://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">report Game File</a> (paywalled). IGN note this is likely due to EA increasing the size of core teams, which scans with Miele's stated focus on a few select game series.</p>
<p>Between them, Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/EGpW3RvZP2o">good video on the EA-published Spore</a> I watched some of last night. When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a> was released, it shipped with some undisclosed dodgy DRM software named Securom that limited each copy to three device installs via a code. If you happened to upgrade your hardware during this time, there's a chance you would have been locked out of playing the game you bought. Partly as a result, Spore remains one of the most pirated games of all time, although whether you should pirate every product Andrew Wilson has a hand in from now until the end of time is the sort of question you'll have to answer yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
