            <p>
Despite many others disagreeing with this stance, I am of the opinion that it's completely fine that we'll likely never get a "classic" 3D Zelda game again. By that I mean, the whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> format is definitely the direction Nintendo will continue to go in, they've just been too popular. However, I understand the desire for such an experience all the same, and I think Demi and the Fractured Dream might be able to scratch that itch.
</p>
<p>
Announced during today's Annapurna Direct, Demi has you playing as, uh, Demi! A "voidsent" born into a world with a cursed fate he's trying to avoid. It's the debut title from Yarn Owl, and honestly, it really does kind of look like they went "hey wanna make a '90s era Zelda game?" That's not a knock against it to be clear, as it's also a nicely stylish and swish looking game.

I often find that games inspired by the 3D Zeldas can look and feel a bit too flat, or uninspired. Demi the game has a real strong vibe going for it, with Demi the character appealing to my own sensibilities quite a lot. I very much vibe with his deer boy vibe, his sword with a handle made from what looks like a tree branch is cool as heck, and yeah, I even like that he literally just has Link's pointy, droopy hat but in blue. Combat looks nice and smooth too, though that's something I'd have to try out for myself at some point to comment on it properly.
</p>
<p>
As of right now it doesn't have a release date, but you can probably already guess that it's coming to PC given that I covered it here.

With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> having received an indefinite delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">back in June</a>, that just leaves one game to test whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. While this one has been cooking for a while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-prepares-to-stake-its-claim-in-making-extraction-shooters-popular-with-an-october-release-date">it actually has a release date</a>, October 30th. There's been a few tests along the way, and it turns out the devs have one last one in them!
</p>
<p>
The good thing about this test - they're calling it a Server Slam - is that it's completely open to everyone. You don't need any kind of access code, and despite this announcement coming with the shooter's pre-order trailer, you do not in fact have to pre-order it either. This test is taking place between October 17th and 19th, across PC and console, and essentially it's just to get as many people playing as possible to ensure there are no server hiccups when the game actually launches.
</p>

Apparently this test will take place on the Dam Battlegrounds map for those in the know, and you'll be able to get a taste of the game's progression, crafting, and quest systems. It's worth noting that none of this progress will carry over to the full game, so don't get too deep into it. You'll get a backpack cosmetic as a little treat in the full game for your troubles at least.
</p><p>
I've said it before on this site and I'll say it again, I'm not particularly big on shooters, but I'm always curious about a burgeoning genre or subgenre. Sure extraction shooters aren't exactly new, but they are quite hard to recommend given how easy it can be to lose progress. Not sure if I'll be jumping in at launch, though I'll be keeping my eye on it to see how things go at least.

<p>
Arc Raiders is out October 30th.
