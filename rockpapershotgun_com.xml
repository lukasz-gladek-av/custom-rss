Dear reader, allow me, if you will, a moment of honesty. I truly, wholly did not know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> was still going. Not only is it still going, but yesterday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shared a look at the game's impending second year of updates, so I really missed the boat on this one - pun intended, of course. The first season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> game's second year has already kicked off, introducing a few new features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters there's new world tiers, which are basically just optional difficult levels you can choose for certain challenges. Pick a higher tier, get better rewards, simple! There's item ascension now too, which lets you improve your gear with things like randomized buffs and "modifiable slots." Season 1 will be getting a mid-season update too that'll bring in a new PvP feature called Death Tides, essentially a capture and control kind of mode.

<p>
Season 2, which will arrive sometime this summer, will be bringing in playable large ships, but more notably, there'll be factions to choose from each of which have their own boons. Other factions will be hostile to you though, so take that into consideration. After that there's season 3 in the fall, with its biggest addition being land combat. Feels like something you'd think would be there from day one, but we all know how rocky a development period Skull and Bones has had.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, there's season 4, which is quite literally adding in a kraken. It's a pirate game! Of course you have to have a kraken. Outside of that there's the addition of the Hunters Guild, you won't be surprised to hear that it focuses on hunting sea creatures, and there'll be a new large ship to be acquired too.
</p>
<p>
If the fact that Skull and Bones is continuing to receive updates has convinced you to give it a go, perhaps hold off on buying it, as the game is getting a free weekend this week, from April 17th-21st. Can't say I saw this game lasting longer than a year, so kudos to the devs for keeping things ship shape - pun intended, of course.

            <p>The Completely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/normal-fishing">Normal Fishing</a> subgenre continues to flourish with the announcement of Dreadmoor, a jolly little tugboat enterprise set in a world of island-sized ribcages and heightened background radiation. My goodness, so normal! Normality readings off the scale. I am confident that nothing foetid and otherworldly waits in the darkness, far below your rudder. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The obvious parallel here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, the top-down cosmic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trawling sim from Black Salt Games. Our previous captain Katharine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dredge-review">was a big fan</a>. At the risk of yet again sounding like Dr Contrarian S. Hype-Puncturer, I thought it was a bit mid. I loved the concept of reeling tetromino-shaped Cthulhaddock from the abyss while reckoning with a day-night cycle, but in practice, it just felt like a load of fetchquests revolving around a not especially gratifying mystery. </p>
<p>Dreadmoor resembles Dredge so closely in places that I'm tempted to refer to it as Dredgemore. It, too, obliges you to cram asymmetrical bottom-feeders into a grid-based inventory, rotating them to make optimal use of space. It, too, asks you to be careful after sundown. It, too, favours warm, flat colours and cartoon contours, to the point that the giant angler fish that emerge to swallow your boat seem almost pettable. It, too, follows a loop of selling bizarre ocean fauna to swivel-eyed weirdos, then using the proceeds to upgrade your ship and craft new gear.</p>
<p>But Dreadmoor cribs just as much from Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, with the ability to roam inside your boat, cast lines and even venture ashore in first-person view. The boat can be steered in third-person, the better to avoid any tentacles grasping at your timbers. I imagine all that's very attractive to people who are hankering for a Dredge 2.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm most enticed by the idea of crafting my own fishing lures, which puts me nicely in mind of China Mieville's The Scar. Remember the hook they used to reel in the Avanc? I'm not sure Dreadmoor's doughty steamship has the buoyancy or ballast for that kind of prey, but I live in hope/terror. There are apparently about 100 species of aquatic organism to yank rudely from the depths. You probably won't want to keep the stranger breeds aboard your vessel for long.</p>
<p>Dreadmoor has no release date as yet - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3629430/DREADMOOR/">read more on Steam</a>.

It turns out you won't actually be spicing up your life next month, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a delay. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> MMO was originally supposed to be launching this coming May 20th, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421">Steam post</a> was shared today sharing that its release date has been pushed to June 10th. Those that have the deluxe or ultimate edition on order will still be able to play it a few days earlier, now June 5th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Funcom explained that they came to this decision through feedback they've received from beta testers. On the flipside of things, there is some good news: a "large-scale weekend" is now planned for next month where "even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback." Though, hopefully this round of feedback won't delay the game further - can only imagine how much the devs will have to crunch with only three extra weeks! There's no further details about this beta just yet, but apparently they'll be coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening had originally been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-burst-out-of-the-early-access-sands-in-early-2025">scheduled for sometime in "early 2025"</a>, but as with many games these days, plans change. I'm not sure if June counts as early any more, at least it's still technically in the first half of the year.
</p>
<p>
Right around this piece is likely to have gone live Funcom are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0KqiqdiBZ0&amp;ab_channel=Funcom">holding a livestream</a> showing off the game's combat, which seems like a good way to get a better feel for the game ahead of its new June release date.
