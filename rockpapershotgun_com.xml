            <p>
In Crisol: Theater of Idols, you fire bullets of your own blood at frenzied wooden puppets while exploring an island saturated with unpleasant Spanish folklore. As elevator pitches go, I like the immediacy of this one's trade-offs. Blood? But I need that stuff inside my body to convey oxygen and vital nutrients to my trigger fingers. Surely there are other fluids I can fill the bullets with. I get that it would prompt the less sexy kind of revulsion, but Norman Reedus <em>did</em> get away with lobbing cannisters of piss and dribble in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crisol has a demo on Steam as part of this week's Steam Nexus Festering. Being a fan of hideous marionettes and foetid folkliquorice, I was about to download it. But then my powerful journalistic brain kicked into gear, and I realised that I'd already tried Crisol at this year's Summer Game Fest. My belated verdict from back then: the doomy circus setting and scarlet-gold aesthetics are appetising, but the controls are tanky in a way that is sometimes more annoying than thrilling. It's also a bit creaky and forced in terms of scenario design.
</p>
<p>
Here is one such scenario, which also appears in the below trailer: at one point I had to pass through a tumbledown high street area patrolled by a colossal and unkillable jugger-puppet. This objective saw me alternating between crouch-walking through the mud and ducking into shops along the route to scoop up some consumables. Then I came to a gate I had to raise by laboriously turning a crank for a moment or two. Doing this locked me in place, unable to keep an eye on the street behind. You get the idea.

<p>
It took me three attempts, with the jugger-puppet chasing me back indoors each time. While hiding inside shops, I had the pleasure of staring absently at the creature's crotch while it bellowed hoarse threats through windows that were surely large enough to admit its frame. After 20 seconds of this, the roided-up Guignol would go back to its patrol. I guess this kind of ponderous scripting makes sense when you're actually held together by strings. 
</p><p>
Cristol's overall tone veers a bit uncertainly between Guillermo del Torrid art-housiness and House of the Dead. Still, I quite like the wincing restraint imposed by the literal plasma gun gimmick, and the associated pressure to delve around in the crannies for sources of blood besides yourself. I like the webbed and brassy lustre of the vampiric weapons, especially the shotgun, with its double-barrelled syringes. And I quite enjoy the puppets, even though they are functionally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s villagers in their plodding relentlessness and susceptibility to limbshots. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Find the demo here</a>.

            <p>Another group of workers at Microsoft-owned Blizzard have voted to form a union, with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) set to represent them. The CWA say that this union will be made up of "nearly 400" workers across Blizzard's platform and technology department.</p>
<p>Their action follows the formation of a number of other unions at Blizzard over the past couple of years, with developers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">Overwatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-450-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionise-because-passion-cant-protect-us-from-job-instability">Diablo</a> all having recently secured representation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a CWA press release, this latest union is made up of software engineers, project and product managers, graphic designers on Battle.net, localisers, QA testers, and customer support staff.  It's already been formally recognised by Blizzard parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>"I’ve seen too many of my talented coworkers leave the company, either due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, a lack of fair compensation, or proper accommodations not being met," said Blizzard senior quality analyst and organising committee member Timothy Biley. "I’m extremely happy that we, the workers, have greater control over our workplace and that we finally have a seat at the table to truly make Blizzard a company we are proud to work for."</p><p>"Blizzard workers in Texas are joining a new generation of video game developers who know their worth and are standing up for it," the CWA's Ron Swaggerty added. "Together with our siblings in California and beyond, they’re proving that no matter where you work, organizing is how we make this industry sustainable for the people who power it."</p>
<p>A large number of staff at Microsoft have unionised in recent years, from workers at Call of Duty developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">Raven Software</a>, to Fallout and Elder Scrolls studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda</a>, and Elder Scrolls Online developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">ZeniMax</a>. Given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cuts and cancellations</a> the company have dished out since they absorbed ActiBlizz, it's not hard to see why folks are seeking these protections.</p>
<p>Solidarity to these freshly-unionised Blizzard workers.</p>

            <p>The future of GZDoom, the community-updated engine behind many thousands of brilliant Doom mods, is in doubt following a bust-up over the lead developer's use of generative AI to create code. The fracas has seen a number of GZDoom developers announce plans to splinter off and maintain their own engine, UZDoom.
</p><!--more-->
<p>New to GZDoom? It's a fork of Doom source port Zdoom, first released by Christoph Oelckers, aka Graf Zahl, back in 2005. A vast number of Doom modding projects make use of it, including such RPS headliners as literary horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">MyHouse.wad</a>, demon-petting add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-doom-mod-finally-lets-us-make-friends-with-the-cacodemons">Cacofrendo</a> (pictured), and unofficial Wolfenstein 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-of-agony-doom-wolfenstein-mod">Blade Of Agony</a>.
</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">GamingOnLinux</a>, a moderator recently posted on Discord about strife between Oelckers and various members of the community. "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom," they write. 
</p>
<p>The fracas appears to be only partly to do with Oelckers' usage of ChatGPT. Going by the chat on Discord and elsewhere, the backlash is fuelled by long-term misgivings about his bulldozing leadership style. Aside from replicating all of GZDoom's features, the Discord moderator post continues, the UZDoom rebels aim to offer "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'". 
</p><p>Further investigation takes us to this <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">Github page</a> for a GZDoom update that features some code by Oelckers, derived from ChatGPT. It has spawned a comments thread full of people arguing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/oct/08/the-ai-valuation-bubble-is-now-getting-silly">the generative AI financial bubble</a> and the ethics and utility of coding with genAI. Oelckers has both defended his use of ChatGPT, arguing that a lot of programmers secretly deploy large language learning models for smaller tasks, and offhandedly invited the angry users to fork the engine and work on their own version.</p>
<p>The ire has spilled over into <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">later Github bug reports</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">this Reddit thread</a> summarising the situation, which includes further postage from pissed-off GZDoom devs. A few Doom modders have also been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/himynameischair.bsky.social/post/3m36lqd7kbc2s">airing their</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m36nql4u3c2l">grievances</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can only scratch my head and look worried at a lot of this. I know eff-all about the twists and turns of GZDoom's long development - I am one of those drive-by Doomlites who downloads a cool wad every blue moon. Still, it all feels rather momentous, given the sheer number of projects that use the engine. More to follow, I'm sure.</p>
