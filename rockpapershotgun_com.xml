            <p>I actually can't remember the last time I played a shmup. Maybe a Gradius? I don't know anything about ZPF's genremates or even what its name stands for, but I do know a good colourful big bastard turtle when I see one, and that was enough for me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095410/ZPF/">Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>"Great score!" Zam Pankman-Fried told me after I died 45 seconds in. From this, I learned that ZPF is a massive liar, but also that I actually quite like shmups still. Pretty compelling as far as avoid the bad thing 'em ups go.</p>

<p>There is/was/are going to be <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/pages/zpf">physical carts of this one available</a>, and while I appreciate the commitment to the 16-bit, I know where buying one physical game ends, and it ends with me buying so many I'm forced to start an unsuccessful retro gaming YouTube channel where I film myself in front of my heaving collection to adopt an air of legitimacy like a Netflix documentary trying to convince you to heed an MBA's opinion on magic mushrooms because they're sitting in front of a very large bookshelf. Steam suits my purposes fine for now. Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Inspired by classic horizontal shooters like Lords of Thunder, Elemental Master, and the Thunderforce series, ZPF is a passion project from the designer and developer of Super XYX and Tänzer.</li>
<li>Players will dodge and weave through intense bullet patterns, unleashing a barrage of firepower upon hordes of unique and challenging enemies.</li>
<li>Brace yourself for epic encounters with mid and end-stage bosses, each demanding a different strategy to defeat.</li>
<li>Upgrade your arsenal and gain valuable tips between levels at each of the world’s in-game shops.</li>
<li>Finish every stage and discover a treasure trove of hidden secrets.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say I really like how this one looks, even if I lack the language this morning to call it anything more precise than "colourful and cybery". Rainbow Geiger? Enlighten me, art style knowers. Reminds me quite a bit of <a href="https://hollow-press.net/collections/cyberflesh/products/cyberflesh-boardgame">Hollow Press's Cyberflesh</a>. Will I get good enough at it to see that turtle in the cyberflesh? Doubtful, but I'm motivated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When the tragically half-empty hooch barrel of potential that was Capone 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-sin">Empire Of Sin</a> launched back in late 2020, it also sold a pass pledging two story expansions down the line. The first of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/empire-of-sins-first-dlc-and-major-free-update-launch-november-18th">arrived in 2021</a>. Time and more time passed, prompting a union of shaking fists to wave grubby promissory notes scrawled on diner hamburger wrappers and brace themselves for a trampling by the proverbial Pinkerton agents on horseback of continued disappointment. Despite this, that second DLC never materialised.</p>
<p>Do not fear the sound you hear. The Pinkerton's have not found you - it is simply the heavy clopping of legal obligations being grudgingly fulfilled. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Hunt For Aurora is now available</a>, assuming there's anyone left with the energy to avail it.</p>

<p>Romero Games haven't returned for this one. It's been developed by Moonmana, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628460/Ultimate_pirates/">shonky Pirate MMO fame</a>. The DLC centres around new boss Robin Kray and partner Sylvia Taylor trying to nab "the Aurora diamond". I don't know much about diamonds aside from the absurd onslaught of 60's marketing that popularised the engagement ring, and the capitalisation prompted me to look up the Aurora, although the most interesting piece of information I came away with is that "Fancy" is an actual proper grading term, which I enjoy quite a bit. Nevertheless, "crime friends want shiny rock" feels like a worthy enough setup.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Steam has to say</a> about Hunt For Aurora.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>New Boss:</strong> Robin Kray</li>
<li><strong>New Side Character:</strong> Sylvia Taylor</li>
<li><strong>New Gangster Class:</strong> Vanguard (melee and versatile combat builds)</li>
<li><strong>New Racket:</strong> Dance Clubs</li>
<li><strong>Lucky Companion:</strong> A loyal dog with uncanny good luck</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal Expansion:</strong> High-power Prototype Pistol, Plains Rifle, Model 21 Shotgun, M1886 Sniper Fusil, Irma Submachine Gun, MP 28 Submachine Gun, and Brn. Vz. 26 Machine Gun</li>
<li><strong>6 deadly melee weapons:</strong> P1907, Hooked Quillon Bayonet, 10'' Chef’s Knife, Hunting Knife, Balisong, and Fish Knife</li>
<li><strong>4 New Mission Chains:</strong> Dive into 14 missions in total!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I haven't played Empire Of Sin for a very long time. If you have, can you please let me know if there's likely to be a tangible difference between the Chef's Knife and the Fish Knife?</p>
<p>I chatted to Romero Games back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-empire-of-sins-new-updates-are-adding-more-strategy-more-drama-and-truth-thats-stranger-than-fiction">2021 about the future of Empire Of Sin</a>, following a huge patch. I'd be very interested to learn the full story of how the game was effectively abandoned, because Brenda and the team sounded very motivated at the time.</p></div>
