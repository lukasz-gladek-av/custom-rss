            <p>A quick one: Firaxis have confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> will be Steam Deck verified at launch. It's a pleasant surprise, given that 2016's Civ 6 is still only listed as "playable" on Valve's oversized Switch. I like this news about as much as I'm terrified to realise that Civ 7 is just under a month away. I do not need that much strategy game, this early in the year. But hey, at least I'll be able to play the new 4X in bed as Sid Meier intended.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Admittedly, I don't currently own a Steam Deck - James, ever the fickle lord of hardware, took back the one I was borrowing last year. I'll get that guy. But I've been playing a lot of 4Xs in bed, as it happens. I've just discovered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> runs comfortably on my Dell work laptop. Current activities: trying to find a new location for my roving beetle city that has both a strategic resource and a luxury resource within easy building distance.</p>
<p>There are no giant beetles in Civ 7, but the two games do share a campaign structure in the shape of age-based progression. Every time your civilisation enters a new age, you get to pick from a pool of epoch-making options determined by your prior accomplishments. When playing multiplayer, you have the option of confining the proceedings to a single age. It sounds like quite a significant refresh of the whole caveman-to-spaceman concept. Also significant: in a first for Civ, you can choose your leader separately from your civilisation.</p>
<p>Civ 7 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. "It looks very pretty, and it has some very intriguing ideas (navigable rivers and commander units), and also Gwendoline Christie," summarised Ollie. It's out 11th February and you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A recent spate of forced password resets in Action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2 </a>was acknowledged by developer Grinding Gear Games on Sunday, after a hacker gained access to an administrative account. As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-broke-into-path-of-exile-2-admin-account-hijacked-wave-of-characters-2/">404 Media</a>, this follows several reports on the game's forums and social media from players who'd had their inventories emptied of rare items.</p>

<p>“We totally fucked up here,” said game director Jonathan Rogers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM">a podcast with GhazzyTV</a>, explaining how the hack began with a compromised Steam account linked to an administrative account on the game's website - effectively giving the hacker the same access as customer service, said Rogers. This allowed the hacker to reset passwords and log in as other players.</p>
<p>The next bit involves the sort of granular detail 404 Media are obviously much better at explaining than me, so I'm just going to quote them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinarily, whenever a member of Path of Exile 2’s support staff makes a change, that event is added to a list for potential later auditing. But when it came to resetting passwords, a bug meant that change was saved as a “note” and not an event, Rogers said. The hacker was then able to delete the note saying a password had been changed, an apparent attempt by the hacker to cover their tracks too. Because of this, it wasn’t immediately obvious to GGG what was happening with these account compromises, Rogers said.</p>
<p>“66 notes were deleted, so that would imply that 66 accounts were compromised,” Rogers said, although caveated that GGG only keeps logs for 30 days. Interestingly, the compromise “was all prelaunch of POE2,” Rogers said, meaning that the hacker gained access before the game was even available to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>404 mention these incidents echo other reports of items being stolen in December, but it does sound like it's all been caught and sorted now, with Rogers considering introducing two-factor authentication to player accounts after rolling it out for support accounts in the wake of the incident.</p><p>I've personally been really enjoying POE 2, although I'm playing it very slowly, soaking up the vivid horror and wonderful soundtrack before I inevitably become numb to it all and turn into a loot goblin. "Even incomplete, this huge early access ARPG is a gem," wrote Sophie Glass in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">her review</a>, "with a unique and flexible skill system and compelling world".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new report has thrown fuel on the fire labelled "Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake". Don't ask me why people have started labelling fires. It's probably a rite to summon a Daedra, or something. Anyway, a new version of Bethesda's somewhat scorned 2006 RPG is allegedly in the works at Singapore-based Virtuos. If rumour speak true, it's being made in Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to core systems like blocking, stamina, and sneaking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The peddler of this particular leak is <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">MP1st</a>, who I cherish for their minute attention to things like multiplayer shooter update changelogs, but don't especially know as a spreader of inside gossip. As such, I was wary of writing this up yesterday. But on reflection, there is a paper trail: an Oblivion remake is mentioned (among many other things) on the 2020 planning document Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared as part of FTC court proceedings back in 2023</a>. So here I am playing Journo Come Lately.
</p>
<p>
MP1st attribute their information to the website of a "former Virtuos employee" who worked on the game from 2023 to 2024. They'd rather not say who or link to the website in question because they want to protect the user's privacy, which I'm sure has nothing to do with wanting other sites to link to them so they can rank highly on Google for the term "Oblivion remake".</p>
<p>My sibling journalists, if that's the actual thinking here, I am not judging. When I was OXM's online editor I had a whole network of speculative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> DLC pieces that daisy-chained to each other in a slow-mo SEO centrifuge of surgically imagined Dwemer fan fiction. Given that everything lives in the cloud, now, I'm pretty sure current Bethesda developers struggle to distinguish my Tamrielic Google-stew from the official lore bible. They're probably training AIs with it. I suspect it's a core component of the plot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-news-exclusivity-races-setting">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.
</p><p>
Anyway, the former Virtuos employee supposedly cited by MP1st claims that Oblivion is being "fully remade" using Epic's ubiquitous Unreal tools, rather than Bethesda's Creation Engine (a descendant of the Gamebryo engine originally used for Oblivion). Apparently, the project makes changes to six particular aspects of the 2006 game: in MP1st's paraphrase, "Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD".
</p>
<p>
As regards blocking, the remake developers have apparently taken inspiration from Soulslikes, because the old system was too "boring" and "frustrating". The presentation of sneaking has allegedly been freshened up with highlighted icons, and damage calculation has been reworked. The remake's handling of stamina is said to be more forgiving - it's harder to get knocked down when you run out of juice. The HUD has been revamped for younger players, and they've added hit reactions for the player and NPCs to make combat more readable. Archery, finally, now has a selection of third and first-person viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
All of which sounds plausible enough, in that I could use approximately this combination of ideas to describe any number of remakes of games from the mid-aughts.
</p>
<p>
Let's briefly return to that leaked 2020 Microsoft planning document. It had the Oblivion remaster down for release in fiscal year 2022. I'm pretty sure that didn't happen? If it did, our standing with Bethesda PR is even worse than I thought. Perhaps the 2020 planning document was actually an AI-generated descendant of my network of articles on the doings of the Dwemer. I am reporting upon a hell of my own creation!</p><p>It can't be, though, because the document also made mention of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> remaster and, perhaps most excitingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-is-the-only-exciting-thing-on-bethesdas-leaked-5-year-plan-and-im-worried">Dishonored 3</a>. We'll hopefully get closure on all this at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/">the next Xbox Developer Direct</a> on 23rd January. There's a "brand new game" in the offing.</p>
<p>Oblivion is perhaps the least-loved of the Elder Scrolls, or the least trendy, anyway. It's sort of a big green lobby area parked between the oddness of Morrowind and the grandness of Skyrim. Still, it made a splash as the first proper Elder Scrolls game for consoles, and I'm intrigued by the notion that it might be considered hip again. After all, it's hip to like things other people hate. I’m off to write another load of SEO-teasing fan fiction about the tragedy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6hVmn9FM7o">Fithragaer</a>, the most absent-minded battlemage in Cyrodiil.
