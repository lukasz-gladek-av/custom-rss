            <p>
Former Bethesda marketing chief Pete Hines has been chatting about the ups and downs of videogame subscription platforms, such as Microsoft's Game Pass service, GeForce Now and whatever the hell Ubisoft are calling theirs at the minute. Subisoftscription? UbiPassPlus? Answers on a postcard.</p>
<p>Hines is broadly of the opinion that subscription platforms are failing many of the developers who sign up to publish through them, though he cautions that his experience is out-of-date - he retired from Bethesda in October 2023.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In his time at Bethesda under Microsoft, Hines helped Bethesda bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> to Xbox Game Pass. He seems to regret this. "I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today," Hines told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines?trk=public_post_comment-text">DBLTAP</a> this month. "At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. 
</p>
<p>
"Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content - without which your subscription is worth jack shit - then you have a real problem. 
</p><p>
"You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product," Hines went on. "That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making." 
</p>
<p>
Hines didn't go into proper specifics, so it's left to me, a no-nothing figures-averse jackass, to scrabble together what relevant insights I can in the closing seconds of this awful Monday. 
</p>
<p>
The battle lines for whether game subscription services are The Industry's second coming or the work of the Devil (why not both, etc) are pretty well-drawn at this point. Anecdotally, at least, subscription models appear to make people less willing to spend money on individual new games. They indisputably grant more power to platform holders and storefronts. 
</p>
<p>
Platform holders such as Microsoft have often contended that the relationship between the New Hotness of subscription and the olde worlde approach of owning (a license to play) a game is complementary. They suggest that a healthy subscription business will spill over into separate purchases down the line - for example, people buying games that are no longer part of the subscription library.</p><p>Without wishing to portray myself as a comprehensive researcher - see "no-nothing jackass", above - I have come across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187#s0145">one study of Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a> that appears to bear elements of the latter argument out, showing that in contrast to the music or movie and TV industry, these subscription services have not "substantially cannibalized existing revenue streams". 
</p>
<p>
Still, that's treating the income from games on those platforms as a block. Individual developers have reported different returns from adding their games to subscription platforms. Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29">LinkedIn</a> this week in response to Hines's comments above, former Xbox Game Studios vice-president Shannon Loftis suggested that games often suffer for appearing on Game Pass, unless they include a bunch of ways to make money after release. "While [Game Pass] can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.)," she wrote, "the majority of game adoption on Gap comes at the expense of retail revenue, unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization."
</p>
<p>
The other question is whether subscription models are really worth it for the platform holders themselves, given that historically, subscription models have tended to rely on undercharging at first, then belatedly raising the price and making your money back once you've got the audience hooked.</p>
<p>In July, Microsoft reported $5 billion in revenue from Game Pass over the past year. Sources <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368">have told</a> Chris Dring, formerly of GamesIndustry.biz, that "Xbox Game Pass is profitable, even when you factor in the lost sales for its first-party teams". It doesn't appear profitable enough, however, going by Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">recent mass layoffs</a>, but then again, it feels like Microsoft could  pioneer a way to literally grow money on trees right now and still find cause to punt a hundred QA testers into the sea.
</p><p>
I don't have a Game Pass subscription myself, partly because I'm trying to support <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the BDS campaign against Microsoft</a>. In general, I don't like subscription models because it feels like paying rent, and thereby teaches me to think of playing games as even more of a value-extraction exercise. I feel pressured to download and play a load of games to maximise the return on my investment, and then I start to loathe myself, because somebody poured heart and soul into e.g. that cottagecore feline frisbee simulator, and here I am shovelling it down to meet quota. How are you getting on with such things?

            <p>If you peered into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-borderlands-4-celestial-empire-building-and-the-first-big-dune-awakening-dlc">Edwin's maw</a> this morning, you might have seen that Trainatic's out today, September 8th. Well, having now given its demo a go, I can waft away a bit more of the billowing steam of mystery for those standing on the platform who're considering boarding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's a thing you'll say very quickly once you fire up either the demo or full version of this train-builder from developer Ryan Forrester, whose previous works include idle frog collector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/croakoloco-is-not-an-idle-game-because-simply-being-around-frogs-is-a-powerfully-worthwhile-activity">Croakoloco</a> and cleaning sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113490/Mess_Quest/?curator_clanid=43192431">Mess Quest</a>. It's the following: 'Oh crikey, my train's stopped already.'</p>
<p>You see, while the aim of the game is to build a train that can chug along for ages, the loco you start with runs out of fuel when it's barely left the station. That's ok, though. You've got a machine gun perched on the single car behind your engine, and you can use it to shoot some trees during your next trip. This, as well as just running over trees which are perched too close to the tracks (though that understandably damages your loco), is how you gather resources to upgrade the train.</p>
<p>With fuel being the limiting factor on journey length early doors, I invested in improvements to both capacity and efficiency for that off the bat. Soon, with help from an upgrade that let me add an extra car to my train, beginning the process of <strong>enlengthening</strong>, I had a fuel support carriage which would replenish a bit of fuel whenever I shot a tree with my gun.</p>

<p>From there, I began to upgrade the likes of my loco's speed, its firepower, and its storage capacity. Some of the numbers assigned to these upgrades seemed a bit nebulous in terms of how exactly they corresponded to my loco's performance on the tracks, but I didn't much mind that given Trainatic's relatively chill approach to things. As a result of what's a bit of a grindy start, though everything's simple and quick enough that it doesn't drag, I started going on journeys that felt a bit less like brief jaunts down the road. That's when I saw it.</p><p>A pinkish purple orb, spinning its way across the dark and earthy terrain of the woodland surrounding the tracks. Back at the station, a line from my faceless trainmaster, speculating about some strange power that could be linked to the neon interloper. Hmmm.</p>
<p>While I've unlocked automatic acceleration to go alongside the automatic trigger finger Trainatic offers, it's not enough of an idler that I'll be able to pursue this orbnigma while doing something far less important in another tab. So, my full attention will have to be on the train building, the task of taping together a Thomas the tank teeming with tech to ponder those damn orbs.</p>
<p>So far, the game's steadily constructing what almost feels like a stripped-back rail roguelike, and one that's worth at least hopping on for a free test ride. If you fancy doing so, you can find both the demo and full version of Trainatic on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Steam</a>, with the latter costing £3.99/$4.79/€4.71 as of writing, thanks to an offer running until September 22nd.</p>

            <p>Steam tells me I've spent 171 hours of my life to this point playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>. It's not an insignificant amount of time, but it pales in comparison to how long I've spent with the myriad other works of developers Bethesda. Said devs now look like they might have fired up the tease rocket for the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s second major expansion. If they have, the very little they've shown off so far hasn't gotten me right on board to play more.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Almost a year since Starfield's first DLC, Shattered Space, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-shattered-space-looks-like-a-wise-return-to-bethesda-basics">unleashed its spooky gunk</a>, Bethesda commemorated the second anniversary of the game's release by tweeting the short video below.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Yep, the piss filter of teaseage was whipped out, with fans rearranging the frames in such fashion that they read "Terran Armada". Naturally, the conclusion jumped to by plenty of folks is that this could be the name of the second expansion the developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-will-get-at-least-one-more-expansion-after-shattered-space-todd-howard-says">had set in stone for a while</a>, but haven't said anything about beyond that.</p>
<p>The name suggests a fleet of ships from or somehow related to Earth, and if that's the case, my feelings are best summed up by a straight-faced shrug. As much as judging a Bethesda DLC by the name's pretty pointless, in the absence of any other info, the idea of an expansion focused around Earthly matters doesn't get me too excited.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Let me outline why. With its relative lack of aliens outside of hostile planet-dwelling creatures, a fairly dry and scientific NASA-inspired brand of sci-fi, and the fate of Earth being a key thread in its main plot, Starfield feels to me like it's done plenty of Earthy stuff already. It's even done the idea of a ship full of folks from Earth randomly popping up to beef with the residents of the Settled Systems. Remember visiting Paradiso on Porrima II, then serving as the middleperson between the resort and the Earth Colony Ship Constant, the latter of which had somehow managed to roam through space encountering nobody else for about 200 years?</p><p>I do, and it was perfectly meh. That's not to say a DLC couldn't put a twist on a tale like that or find another, intriguing way to revamp the relatively featureless sand-ball that was Starfield's ruined Earth. However, as I outlined when I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/starfield-shattered-space-review">reviewed the Shattered Space expansion</a> at my former home, my view's long been that the best way Bethesda can utilise Starfield DLC is to paint a bit more colour and vibrance onto the canvas of an impressively vast but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfields-abandoned-gore-and-dismemberment-system-sure-would-have-made-it-less-grey">often quite bland</a> universe.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that first DLC was about snake worshippers on a purple planet, so you can argue that for variety's sake trying to go the weird and alien route again wouldn't be ideal. Though, I reckon at this point you might as well embrace the out-there ideas. No one DLC's going to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-individually-rebutting-starfield-steam-reviewers-defending-the-loading-breaks-and-empty-worlds">rehabilitate Starfield's reputation</a> from would-be masterpiece that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">didn't measure up to the endless hype</a>, to universally beloved sibling of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout juggernauts. </p>
<p>A sequel would have that chance, though, assuming it arrived before the actual heat-death of our universe. So, why not go after the strange and unique, as those other Bethesda-helmed series I've just cited have in some of their strongest and most memorable moments, both in the publisher's hands and outside of them? Even if the game ends up being a one-off, have it go out with one or a series of supernova explosions, rather than the cosmic whimper of an aging comet.</p>
<p>We'll just have to see which of those "Terran Armada" ends up being, assuming it's a DLC tease and not just Todd Howard's lunch order.</p>
