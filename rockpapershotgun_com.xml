            <p>Maybe prepare to dig out your finest gaudy suit and mountains of, er, a certain substance. A PC re-release of Radical Entertainment's Scarface: The World Is Yours has suddenly popped up on the Epic Store and Steam. The Epic version is available already, having been "unintentionally pushed live" early due to backend issues, according to new publishers EC Digital Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Listings for the 2006 GTA-like were quickly spotted on both storefronts, with the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f">Epic version</a> on sale for Â£23.79 / $29.99, while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/">Steam listing</a> says a release date's to be announced down the line. The company who look to be behind the resurrection, EC Digital Entertainment, have offered an explanation for this discrepancy in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4113570/view/542246264930041873?l=english">Steam announcement</a>.</p>
<p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned," the publishers wrote. "We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version. As such, you may notice that the current Steam page includes placeholder content. This will be updated leading up to the official release."</p>
<p>"When the game officially launches on Steam, it will include an optional HD graphics upgrade, offered as a free DLC," EC Digital continued, adding a disclaimer that the graphical upgrade may be "subject to change". As for what it entails, they explained: "This enhanced mode uses AI-assisted techniques to improve certain visual elements while keeping the core experience intact. The use of AI is completely optional. Players can choose to play in original or enhanced visuals at any time."</p><p>Now, this is where things get a bit strange. My efforts to look into who are EC Digital Entertainment have borne very little fruit. <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/scarface-the-world-is-yours-pc-re-release-announced">Gematsu</a>'s report on the re-release cites them as a Hong Kong-based publisher, but following the link through to its info/category page on the site only sees you greeted with the Scarface story, a link to a <a href="https://www.ecdeasia.com/">website</a> that's pinging up an access block notification for me, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube channel</a> with three subscribers which has a sole video uploaded in 2009.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwGZe9uvAFk">20 second trailer</a> for seemingly defunct prehistoric RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stoneage-2">Stone Age 2</a>, with the description linking a website for it that doesn't appear to exist anymore. A quick Google search of their name hasn't immediately turned up any other info about the publishers and their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=EC%20Digital">Steam profile</a> doesn't list any other games they've published.</p>
<p>One user in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/comment/nkq6bwc/">Reddit thread</a> about the re-release has claimed that the new Epic version of Scarface: The World Is Yours comes with the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> and <a href="https://fusionfix.io/wfp">Fusion Fix</a> mods pre-installed. Sadly, <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">according to</a> one of the modders behind the two, who goes by the handle Silent, if this is the case it's happened without permission. "None of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice)," they wrote. "I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. I'm going to inquire for further information to the best of my abilities, but so far I doubt that release was cleared with Universal."</p>
<p>So yeah, that's why I was hesitant to encourage the digging out of Al Pacino outfits earlier. There's a chance EC Digital Entertainment have done a proper deal for the game's rights, but if this re-release is of the unapproved or dodgy variety, odds are a takedown could be incoming.</p>

            <p>
Steam is getting a new eight-week calendar feature for both games you've wishlisted and recommended games based on your previous playtime. No longer will you have to source recommendations by reading tea leaves, or visualise your wishlist by labelling different-shaped food in your fridge. Now, you'll get a proper, personalised Monday-to-Friday chart that refreshes every day. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Why doesn't the calendar cover weekends? Because Valve think most developers don't release games at the weekend, and they want to avoid cluttering up the view with empty squares. Any calendar recommendations that do have the insolence to materialise on a Saturday or Sunday will appear in the following Monday box instead.
</p>
<p>
Valve have published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/507342099205587495">a blog</a> for this latest "Steam Labs Experiment", explaining how the calendar's recommendations functionality works. "This new calendar finds people with similar playtime profiles to you, and then looks at the games those players have been adding to their wishlist," the platform holders write. 
</p>
<p>
They add that trying out a bunch of games, as when panning the demo deluge during Next Fests, won't affect your recommendations much, as the system is "more focused on games that you play the most (relative to other players), and spend most of your playtime in. So, a few minutes trying out a couple of new games or demos won't have much impact on your recommendations, but sinking a bunch of time into a new favorite will."
</p><p>
As for the daily calender refreshes, "in reality you aren't likely to see your recommendations change all that much from day to day, but as time goes by you will obviously see new things pop up as the 8-week horizon of the calendar marches forward, or as games lock in their release dates."
</p>
<p>
The calendar includes a round-up of already-released recommended games, covering the past week and the past month. These aren't organised by day or date, as Valve don't think you're bothered about specifics once a game has launched. There are also filters for adjusting the number of games displayed, hiding owned games, and selecting them by tag. As with Steam's upcoming feeds, the calendar also filters out games based on your wider content settings.
</p>
<p>
As ever, this kind of platform level adjustment could make a huge difference to the fortunes of any number of developers. Steam carries a vast quantity of games, and 'discoverability' is a perennial bugbear.</p>
<p>I've never been hugely impressed by Steam's recommendation systems, which seem far too cautious. "Mayhap if you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> you will like [consults notes, sweating] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>?" I've also never really gotten along with calendars - paper ones have to be replaced, and digital ones have all this widgety bullshit in them. Still, the new all-in-one Steam calendars feel like an advance over filtering my wishlist.
