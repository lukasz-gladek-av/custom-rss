            <p>
Not long before joining Rock Paper Shotgun, I wrote a feature for Edge magazine about the origins of the very silly term "AAA game". The overall conclusion I came to is that "AAA game" is possibly a boardroom-level borrowing from the credit rating industry and Hollywood, and that it has little meaning beyond "most expensive/biggest". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a bauble casually excreted by pinstriped cats wallowing in jacuzzis sometime in the mid-90s, for the benefit of the investor class. But in much the same way that any fleck of dust can become a pearl, or at least a larger clump of dust, so the term has attracted additional meanings and significance over the ensuing years, partly because game journalists like myself keep taking it seriously.</p>
<p>My interviewees talked about triple-A's association with the shift to polygonal 3D graphics, with certain genres such as the open world, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and with exclusive hiring practices that require "triple-A experience" and thus have an unavoidable bias, given that "triple-A" studios have often been staffed predominantly by people of a certain race, gender and background.
</p>
<p>
These more specific developments aside, triple-A has shed an A to produce the retrospectively beloved genre of "AA games", aka grainy noughties shooters with a gimmick, and also sprouted additional As. Concluding the Edge write-up, I touched briefly and humorously on Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/">coining of "AAAA game" </a>in a brazen attempt to mindfuck people complaining about the delayed release and pricing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>. 
</p><p>
As sure as the sparrows fly south for winter, another executive has now gazumped Guillemot. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">Ian Games</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/god-help-us-all-gta-6-may-be-a-aaaaa-game-says-devolver-co-founder-and-thats-why-the-entire-industry-is-taking-cover-from-it-like-its-a-nuclear-blast/">Percy Gamer</a> for spotting) about the dark art of competing with other publishers for release dates, Devolver co-founder Nigel Lowrie has described <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> as an "AAAAA game". Here's the complete sentence: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lowrie isn't the first to try this, admittedly. CD Projekt Red's investor relations VP Karolina Gnaś <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-nielubowicz-chief-financial-officer-i-karolina-gnas-vp-ds-relacji-inwestorskich-cd-projekt-sa-start-29-marca-o-godz-1100,704">has already been there and bought the T-shirt</a>. But Gnaś was poking fun at Ubisoft's "AAAA game" claim at the time, whereas Lowrie seems to be in earnest. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, he seems to think that "AAAA game" is everyday parlance now. I, for one, was not consulted about this, but I can see why The Industry might be in a hurry to leave AAAA behind. To my knowledge, the only card-carrying AAAA games besides the ailing Skull and Bones are Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the current record-holder for longest-serving vapourware, and Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, which was recently cancelled. If AAA means "most expensive/biggest", AAAA basically seems to mean "doomed".
</p><p>
The whole circus is worth following inasmuch as it's a crude illustration of the continuing drive to appease investors who are not content with the "maturation" of returns, and are always looking for the next Level Up. Still, I realise the advanced financial language may be confusing to ordinary humans, so I've put together this quick-and-dirty cheatsheet for both existing A-based videogame lifeforms and those likely to emerge the next time an executive joins an earnings call. Here you go:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
AAA - GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAA - Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAA - GTA 6
</p>
<p>
AAAAAA - GTA 6 on max settings
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6: Ultimate Whale's Edition with fully operational Quantum Field simulation and digital rights management supplied by orbital self-guided "Blundershut &amp; Custard" Clockwork Plasma Cannon array
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + gravitational implosion of known universe
</p>
<p>
A - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Gabe, and the Word was Gabe. The same was in the beginning with Gabe. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
<p>AA - [DESYNCHRONIZED]
</p>
<p>
AAA - GTA 3 again

</p></blockquote>
<p>PS. I've just noticed that Edge feature is on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/aaa-developers-discuss-the-three-little-letters-that-have-shaped-an-industry-its-a-stupid-term-its-meaningless/">Gamesradar</a> now, if you fancy a read.</p>

            <p>The first bit of DLC for mud-splattered infrastructure setup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> has rumbled out of the garage, bringing with it a couple of new maps, several extra vehicles, and some extra-tough options for those craving a hard time.</p>
<p>One of those fresh rides is a bridge layer, and you best believe it'll end up wedged somewhere improbable with its wheels spinning helplessly once I get my hands on it. How can you mess up motoring towards a gap, and pressing the 'commence bridgening' button? It'll be possible.</p>

<p>Alongside that bridge layer in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2104890/view/521974992851698336?l=english">Rebuild expansion</a>'s offerings are two new Central European maps. The first,  Contamination, is all about cleanup duty following a train crash dumping something not nice in a river thanks to some earthquaking. Then, there's Wash-Out, which as its name suggests is a rather wet venture into a "reclaimed wasteland" to get an oil processor up and running again.</p><p>Developers Saber Interactive have split 100 new missions between the two, many of which will likely amount to pick thing up or unfuck this please, as is the runner series' tradition. I'm a tad disappointed in the fact that aside from the all-new Vostok MU-97 'Ant' bridge layer, the other four extra vehicles are just revamped versions of rides from the base game. There's a bridge layer conversion for the Tayga dump truck, plus beefed up variants of the Thunder scout, Tuz 119 scout, and Mule T1 crane lorry.</p>
<p>That's it for the stuff included in the expansion, but there's also some free stuff on top of that, in the form of the Wayfarer ST7050 fuel truck and some advanced difficulty options. The latter includes "tougher fuel management, harsher convoy conditions, and stricter recovery rules, while adjusting costs and economy for a more demanding, realistic experience".</p>
<p>While these are features some players have been asking for since release, back when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/roadcraft-review-streamlined-building-biz-beset-by-bumbling-ai-bobs">I reviewed it</a> I quite liked the fact that it omitted some of the nitty gritty management you've got to juggle in a lot of these games. It was something that helped set the RoadCraft experience apart from its muddy siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game">Expeditions</a>, both of which are still getting fairly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1465360/view/543367091067028490?l=english">regular</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477340/view/541115291253342913?l=english">additions</a> for those who want an excuse to hop back into them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Brendy summed the RoadCrafting experience up thus in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roadcraft-review">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>RoadCraft is a podcast game, in the same vein as Truck Simulator or Elite: Dangerous. There's a big place for games like this in the world, sims that excel in delivering a specific kind of wonderful and comforting boredom. Slow tasks that act as a reassuring sedative in the manic whorl of life. But RoadCraft's start-and-go flow makes it a bumpier ride for me. I was falling asleep, but I never quite drifted off into its promised dreamland.</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see what he means about the constructadriving sim having a bit of a mixed-up ethos when it comes to taking it slow all of the time, or being able to speed along if you wish. As the Brendo also wrote, whether you enjoy RoadCraft'll likely depend on how much time you're willing to give it, especially when things go wrong.</p><p>If you've dug this sort of thing before and can clear the calendar, this Rebuild expansion looks a decent reason to fire it up. If only to see whether the bridge layer's as satisfying to use as the stump mulchers and tree harvesters.</p>
