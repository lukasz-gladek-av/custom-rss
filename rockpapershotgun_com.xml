For years now I have watched Haenir's putrid action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blight-survival">Blight: Survival</a> like a miasmatic knight errant squinting through the bushes at a peasant-shaped mushroom. I reached out to the devs for an interview a while ago, and received no reply. I wasn't hugely surprised by their silence: Blight began life as a two-person project, and is a long way from release. Still, there's been some ominous movement of late: the developers have unveiled a new biome and enemies, and are now fielding applications for very limited closed playtesting.

<p>
In Blight: Survival, you and up to three chums roam a squelching hinterland between two warring kingdoms. The conflict has bred a noxious brainrot that has reduced the resident villagers to sporing undead. There are also enemy soldiers to worry about, busily farming the wreckage. You're a graverobber yourself, siphoning gear from the battlefield by means of "mechanics inspired from rogue-lites and extraction games". Your higher goal is to reach and obliterate the source of the Blight. I'd have thought persuading the opposing kingdoms to stop spilling blood everywhere would have been the place to start, but this is a video game.

<p>
I will not say that Blight looks like High Art. I will not say that it courts thematic complexity. It is about hiking through the flyblown boondocks, murdering reanimated shepherds with a longsword. I don't get the sense that any particular commentary on any particular war is being offered. Still, within its stinking parameters, it ticks a number of boxes for me. Firstly, "directional combat", with players angling their sword to swing or parry. Directional combat is often horribly implemented, or treated as a source of comedy, but it worked in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> and it mostly works in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and I'm always drawn to the concept, because I like to feel like I'm literally hefting a sharpened metal stick. To get a sense of it, check out the reveal trailer from 2022.

<p>
Secondly, Blight has some appreciably nasty swamp environments, full of chopped chapels and gibbet trees. It makes me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, but there's some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> here and probably some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as well. I enjoy when games commit to being a swamp level, inasmuch as this is purposefully and viciously alienating a section of your audience in advance. I'm hoping the landscapes will be as enveloping as they seem, with plenty of opportunities to get lost. "Will you go back and secure your spoils or risk it all and push forward?" offers the Steam page. "How far are you willing to go?" That very much depends on whether I've got dinner on, Haenir. When I'm playing an extraction-style game the critical factor is whether the average round lasts longer than it would take a pot of pasta to cook.
</p>
<p>
Haenir's puny ranks have recently been swollen by "several dozen full-time developers" from publisher Behaviour Interactive, including "level designers, narrative writers, programmers, UI/UX devs, concept and VFX artists, animators, sound designers, QA testers, directors, producers, and more". I'm a bit leery of Behaviour, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">recent mass layoffs and closures</a>, but Blight's sweaty skirmishing feels like a decent fit for the creators of Dead by Daylight. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774880/view/545603039390598280?l=english">Read more in the latest Steam blog post, including details about the forthcoming playtests</a>. Release date as yet the game hath none.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">Horror</a> is escaping a melted flesh abomination, but to pull off true terror, you need to have a gleefully murderous human get right up in my face and grin about whatever nasty human stuff they're planning to get up to. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/agni-village-of-calamity">Agni: Village Of Calamity</a>, an Indonesian survival horror that looks interesting for its early Resident Evil influences, but has gotten stuck in my head for specifically evoking Resident Evil 7's intimate human threat. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It's that claustrophobic camera work that's drawn me in. I have to admit I've become so spoiled by indie survival horror of late that I've grown slightly numb to the sort of things that used to excite me. Fixed camera angles. Limited inventory space. I blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a> for being so excellent. But Agni feels deliberate, rather than overly reverent to its influences.</p>
<p>Agni is your character. She's an Indonesian cop who's gone rogue to explore a remote village. Not a remote village, Agni! That's where the bad things happen. I'm especially fond of how the setting allows for more lush and distinct greenery than you might expect from this genre. Not enough vibrant fronds in survival horror, as a rule.</p>
<p>"Throughout the journey, Agni grapples with guilt, fear of abandonment, and unresolved trauma from her past," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151360/Agni_Village_of_Calamity/">Steam</a>, leaning into Silent Hill-isms. "Her perilous journey tests her resolve as she confronts her inner demons while striving to find out what happened and find her missing partner".</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/DYPsXgQHsGk">13 minute gameplay video</a> available besides the trailer. Agni explores an abandoned house with her trusty lighter, strolls past some mannequins (pointing out the tired trope herself, which doesn't absolve you, game), and eventually has to run as they come to life. Again, it's the focus on Agni's own reactions during cinematics that I feel is the strongest part here, lending everything an off-kilter indie cinema slant I'm very drawn to.</p>
<p>Things get progressively strange, but I'll leave that for you to discover on your own. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of post-apocalyptic shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl</a> have shared a roadmap for future updates, promising new guns, smarter foes, and a helpful development kit for modders. Among the changes is good news for anyone frustrated after pumping their entire backpack of bullets into 30 to 50 feral hogs. Murderised mutants will now drop loot of some kind, instead of offering no reward at all.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>We're not told what kind of loot they'll drop, but in the developer's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/572627883580720125">roadmap post on Steam</a> there's a little picture of a tooth scribbled next to the note "mutant loot". So probably lots of handy gizzards and guts. Currently, when you kill a mutant, their corpses are simply empty. This is unlike defeated human foes who can be ransacked for bullets, food, and boots. This means that a series of mutant encounters can quickly drain your ammunition stocks. Especially when it comes to the spongier beasts. And getting nothing back after firing all that precious ammo into hides can feel frustrating to some.</p>
<p>Like I say, it's not the only upcoming change. The developers listed their other priorities for the next three months in the post. Smarter enemy and ally AI are high on the list, with "better cover/flanking use" and "limited grenades". Mutants will soon eat fallen victims if all goes to plan, and will "react to threats". There will also be two new weapons, we're told, alongside widescreen support and "further stabilization".  </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Stalker-2-Beastmaster-4-header.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>I got nothing for killing this? What a boar. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/GSC Game World</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another item on the list is a beta for a planned "ModKit". While there are already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-bulletsponge-mutants-can-be-nerfed-with-this-handy-mod-saving-you-precious-rounds">plenty of handy mods</a> for Stalker 2 (including one that already adds <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389">mutant loot</a>), this SDK will come packaged with a guide and might make modders' lives a little easier. The devs are also planning to set up Steam Workshop support, so players can add mods easily from there. </p>
<p>These plans might change, say GSC Game World in a flavoury disclaimer scribbled at the bottom of the stained note: "Mission targets may be moved from Q2 to later dates in case of Zone instability." </p>
<p>Stalker 2 launched in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-is-out-now-and-buggy-as-hell-but-the-developers-are-already-planning-fixes">very buggy state</a> but was well-received despite the jank. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a> James called it "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off". Soon after the radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> came out, the developers admitted that some important features, such as the "A-life" simulation of patrolling squads, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">simply broken</a>. But they've been routinely and reliably patching things since then, with the latest significant batch of fixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-latest-patch-once-again-comes-with-four-figures-worth-of-fixes-and-improvements">landing last month</a>. </p>
<p>James also once became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beastmaster-of-stalker-2-part-one-how-to-make-friends-and-eviscerate-people">a beastmaster with lots of mutant minions</a> in the game. I wonder how he feels now his "friends" will soon become skinnable loot rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'm thankfully very remote from the capital these days, but Edwin will occasionally regale the morning meeting with dark fables about how much a pint now costs in London. He'll stumble on to camera, his eyes bloodshot and breathing heavy, and we'll all know he's traded a new vital organ for a swift half. Occasionally he'll dart his head around to the sound of banging at the door then immediately dive out of the window, and we'll pray for his safe return after outrunning The Bad Teapot gang, who he borrowed £8000 from in 2006 for a warm plastic beaker of Carling with a dead wasp floating in it. Sounds bleak down there.</p>
<p>As such, I would not blame anyone south of the Severn-Wash for resorting to the stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle </a>drink stealing antics we find in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sipssassin">Sipssassin</a>. You play a bald, sharply dressed sneak thief. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never pay for another drink as long as you live. There are some nonsense lore reasons about why it's actually good and cool that you're half-inching everyone's tipples but that just makes it less fun, honestly. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Many classic stealth tricks are available to you. Disguising yourself as a security guard. Hiding in a cardboard box. Burying yourself in a ridiculously-placed hay bale. Putting a moose head over your victim's eyes so they can't see you pinch their margarita. As with classic Hitman, there are also a selection of mundane objects to bonk people with, stunning them so you can make a getaway. You're not confined to just Agent 47's disappointing son, either. You'll also unlock other characters, one of which is Agent 47's much less disappointing son, a horrible goose.</p>
<p>There are four game modes in all. 'Sipstraction' tasks you simply with stealing six drinks then scoring you on how many times you were discovered. In 'Happy Hour' you'll need to combo guzzle as many ill-gotten bevvies as possible in a two minute time limit. 'Drinkvesitage' involves a "special tracking activity", and there's also an exploration free roam mode, where you'll take on side quests and meet characters. I'll let good mate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820190/Sipssassin/">Steam</a> describe the features. That's just good business sense, that.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>25 playable characters to unlock</li>
<li>5 unique missions with hidden secrets</li>
<li>4 distinct game modes to prove your Sipssassin abilities</li>
<li>Over 60 different drinks to drink</li>
<li>Lots of NPCs to steal drinks from</li>
<li>6 Legendary Drinks that grant special power up abilities</li>
<li>6 Special Gadgets that help you be a sneaky little guy</li>
<li>50 collectible shards to find and rebuild the Chalice of Destiny</li>
<li>Disguises to gain access to restricted areas</li>
<li>Wacky characters to meet and talk to</li>
<li>An alternate dimension video game conference called "Yeet3"</li>
<li>A super long straw so you can drink your neighbor's milkshake</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sipsassin is due out on May 2nd, 2025. No price details, yet. Slightly more than a wasp pint, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>15 years on from the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a>, I still think with fondness and yearning of the Uboinik automatic shotgun. It’s a six chamber cylindrical affair with mouthwatering red shells that dangle before your trigger finger like pert, juicy plums. This is just to say / I have shot / the shells / that were in / the shotgun / and which / you were probably / saving / for the mutant round the corner. / Forgive me / they were murderous / so sockety / and so round. Ahem.</p>
<p>Reloading the shotgun is an intricate process of 1) sliding four shells into the available chambers while tossing the weapon jauntily from hand to hand, and then 2) cocking it again to expose and fill the remaining two chambers. You can also chamber a single shell and cock the weapon, if you don’t have time for a full reload, which means when you load another four shells and fire them, there’ll be an empty chamber to reckon with midway through the next burst. That empty chamber has gotten me killed a dozen times, I think.</p><!--more-->

<p>Somebody poured love into that reloading animation. Love and a certain spitefulness. This is Metro 2033, 4A Games’s spiritual successor to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which takes place in the Moscow underground after the nukes. Ammo is also currency here, and the dingy rails teem with bandits and mutants. There is no time to get poetic about shotguns. Today, 15th April, you can experience all that love and spitefulness for free. The Redux edition is 100% off on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a> till tomorrow to mark the game’s 15th birthday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-metro-2033">the RPS review of the original Metro 2033</a>, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) was wooed but not wowed, calling attention to “a jarring disconnect between the excellence of its appearance and the adequacy of its action.</p>
<p>"It’s a good enough shooter, but it looks like it should be a phenomenal one,” he went on. “In a perfect world, there’ll be a mod that fiddles with the balance, maybe ups the human count and lowers the mutant count, and definitely leaves a few more gas masks lying around.” </p>
<p>The 2014-released Redux version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metro-redux-review">adds a bunch of modes and graphics features</a>: as Christopher Livingston summarised, “if you enjoyed Metro 2033, I strongly suspect you'll like it even more on the new engine, especially since the options for a grueling, hardcore experience are still there despite the revamped stealth and improved AI making things a little easier for you.”</p>
<p>The typical question to ask of any 4A Games news piece is: which 4A Games, exactly? The studio began life in Ukraine in 2006, but in 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta. While they've collaborated on Metro for years, the two studios are now totally separate: 4A Games in Ukraine have rebranded as Reburn, and are now developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, while Metro remains in the hands of the Malta studio, who are still owned by Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
