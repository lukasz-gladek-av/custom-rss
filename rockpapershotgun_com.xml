            <p>
One of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-selection-box-edwins-bonus-games-of-the-year-2024">Xmas selection box games</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-rooms">Withering Rooms</a>, a delightfully frightful haunted house action-RPG that balances mazey Metroidvania level design with the ability to be a witch who can supersize herself and gallop around on suits of magic armour. With a quick glance over my shoulder at our dear friend Sir Eugene Optimisation, I dare to describe it as a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, if Bloodborne had been made by a tiny independent developer. 
</p>
<p>
Also rather Bloodborney: the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/withering-realms">Withering Realms</a>, a sequel of sorts in which you play a ghost girl clinging to the back of a customisable combat doll. Sir Eugene Optimisation requests I add here that the doll conceit reminds him of well-received Soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Which is a fair observation, I think, though I would also say the doll’s lipless, one-eyed grimace reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>. How’s that, Eugene – three for three? Anyway, here’s a trailer.

As the title suggests, the key change here from Withering Rooms is that you’re no longer confined to a single house and grounds. Instead, you’ll get to “explore the mysterious town of Penwyll and the sprawling graveyards, tombs, caves and rotting estates that surround it”, with combat now unfolding on a full 3D plane. The year is 1926, but not as you may recall it if you happen to be 100 years old. In Withering Realms, the first World War was interrupted by an occult event which has caused the dead to walk and spirits to roam. It’s also given certain people the ability to cast spells.
</p>
<p>
The ghost girl is Clover, who died during the above occult event. She’s able to interact with the world only through the doll, which can thankfully be outfitted with a range of bludgeoning, carving or shooting implements, including a “pivoting greatsword” and a “chain rock”. The doll aside, Clover has an ally in “daring freelance investigator” Althea - one of the few other characters who can see her.
</p>
<p>
I still need to finish Withering Rooms but this looks like more of what I enjoyed about that game. There are some involved-sounding overworld mechanics: you can “expand the world map by defeating massive perimeter guardians”, and return to areas at night “to encounter new, horrifying creatures and secrets”.
</p>

Sandworm-bothering MMO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will release on 20th May, developers Funcom have announced, and you can start tailoring your very own Arrakish (I swear it's a canonical term) adventurer by means of the just-released character creator. Any desert delver you produce with said creator can be imported to the full game at launch. 
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Monster Hunter's Hunting Horn, I've recently gotten into the habit of making characters who look like Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. I'm not sure Dune: Awakening has sufficiently puckish hair to support this - not many big frizzy gingers in the Dune universe, in my experience. But I'm willing to give it a shot, for science. Anyway, here's a trailer.

<p>
And here's some blurb about that character creator: "Fine-tune every aspect of your looks, then choose your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. The final choice determines your starting abilities, but you will gain access to every School eventually, and can even mix and match abilities from any of them."
</p>
<p>
The character creator accompanies a benchmark mode, which "lets you check your hardware performance and system compatibility while being treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm." 
</p>
<p>
In the full game, sandworms are a persistent threat that roam the world and are drawn to the sound of players using thumpers, mining spice melange or just walking around on the bare sand. As I discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">in my preview last year</a>, you can lure the worm into attacking rival spice miners. I think this is the part of Dune: Awakening that most has my interest. The idea of building another base and levelling up doesn't really grip me, as much as I like the setting.
</p>
<p>
Read more of Dune: Awakening on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam</a>. Ah, steam. There isn't a lot of that on Arrakis. Water is scanter here than redhead prog rock musicians.

            <p>Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick recently hailed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">the "increasing" importance of the PC market</a> in the lead up to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release this autumn. Could it mean we're getting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> crimeathon the same time as consoles? Buddy, we don't even get <em>updates</em> the same time as consoles. Things might be speeding up on that front at least, based on an email Colin Rockstar sent us earlier. On March 4th, they're giving us some nice gubbins for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> that they previously saw fit to exclusively roll out on machines that don't even have the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>.</p>
<p>The upgrade is free "with a one-time Character Migration flow to bring over your Story Mode and Online progress", and offers new vehicles and vehicle performance upgrades, animal encounters, new graphics options, and faster loading time. There's also a "and much more" in there but Colin loves saying that. You can find the full details on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/akk98a4o755825/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-coming-march-4">Rockstar's website here</a>.</p>

<p>I gave up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a> once it became apparent that Rockstar sneered so hard they tasted their own nostrils every time someone mentioned it, but animal photography feels like a direct transplant from there, no? I haven't touched GTA 5 for years, mind, so I'm not sure if it was already in the game. The update will also feature "recent player experience improvements for GTA Online, including kernel-based anti-cheat protections, and proactive voice chat moderation to help keep GTA Online safe, secure and fun for everyone". Thanks Colin!</p>
<p>In other crime news, Rockstar Games have been reportedly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-let-you-modify-its-own-map-using-roblox-style-user-creation-features-claims-report">thinking about letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map</a> with Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
