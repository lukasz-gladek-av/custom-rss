            <p>What up, murder brothers. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> just got a new PvE mission, featuring the somewhat cranky Trygon, a big Tyranid beastie with more arms than is generally prudent. The boss will burst out of the sands of planet Avarax to stab you with said arms, but only after you hunt him down for a bit. Better take the new weapon the developers are also adding in this update: the Inferno pistol. If you want to see how shiny and well-painted these new additions look (you Warhammer freaks always do) then come gander at the trailer. </p>

<p>You're off to this dusty ruin to pick up a reluctant Tech-Priest who has refused to evacuate. But of course the spiky-limbed Trygon is going to make that difficult. "It bursts from the ground to unleash devastating assaults with its scything claws and bio-electric attacks," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500569576639038653">an update post</a> from developers Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>They've also added that new handgun, the Inferno pistol, to both PvE and PvP modes, a "close-range thermal weapon" that can be used by four of the game's marine classes: Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy. And to make multiplayer PvP a little spicier, they've also opened up other weapons to classes who previously couldn't use them. The Sniper class can now use the Heavy Bolt Pistol and Instigator Bolt Carbine, for example. </p>
<p>There's a small cloister of other stuff. You can now host private multiplayer lobbies, there are some new wolfish skins to buy, alogside new shades of blue and pink to spraypaint onto your little space fascists. You can read <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/191-7-0-patch-notes">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you go bug hunting, let me do a little lore research. Ah, yes, here we go. "The Trygon is a colossal serpentine creature whose iron-hard carapace is proof against all but the heaviest of weapons and whose giant talons can scythe through even the most formidable battle-tank," reads a description of the creature on <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/Tyranid-Trygon">Warhammer's website</a>. Good to clear things up. For me, a "Trygon" sounds like a shape you've never heard of but are asked to draw on graph paper in a high school entrance exam.  </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm not a big Warhammer dude. Although I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review Space Marine 2</a> and found it to be a pretty decent third-person insect repellant, with some well-crafted environments and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-bloody-battles-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-make-for-a-great-photo-mode">great photo mode</a>. Edwin had some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">more nuanced thoughts</a> on its depiction of goosestepping masculinity, worth a read even if, like me, you approach your blockbuster games with bubblegum-chewing aloofness, always ready to spit it out the moment all the flavour is gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last month, "Mark Corrigan's Oblivion" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-getting-a-barber-mode-and-by-golly-i-hope-i-can-actually-be-a-barber">free barber mode update</a>, and now with yesterday's release of <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4">Patch 1.2.4</a>, you can finally have those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>barbers shave Henry of Skalitz boiled butter bean bald. Did baldness signify nail-hard bastardry in medieval times, or simply some kind of maledicted scalp leprosy? Hopefully it's the former. Henry'll need to look tough to survive the new Hardcore mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first casualty of this set of difficulty modifiers is Henry's sense of direction. You'll no longer know exactly where you are on the map, and your compass won't show cardinal directions either. Instead, you'll have to ask NPCs where you are to get your bearings, and look to the heavens to guide your way. No fast travel, either.</p>
<p>There's a selection of 10 negative perks to choose before you start the game, of which you'll have to pick three. For example, you can give Henry a chance to throw his back out while picking herbs, a personal favourite for how mundane and insulting it is. The underground herb economy isn't what it used to be either - the patch also promises a rebalance so "they never sell for a higher price than their buying price". Tracking down a full list of the perks has been a little tricky, but here's an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kcd2-hardcore-mode-perks-tXGwZsn">Imgur gallery with just that</a>.</p>
<p>There's also no combat UI, enemies are more aggressive, and if you get branded for going on a crime spree, there's a perk that makes the brand permanent. I like the sound of it overall. There's a few instances of flat number tweaking, but I can see things having to ask NPCs for directions make the world feel absorbingly textured. I've actually been waiting for this patch to have a proper playthrough. If you don't fancy any of this, the hardcore medieval roleplayers over at Nexusmods are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/kingdomcomedeliverance2">already cooking up fixes</a> for basically everything interesting about the new mode. What are they like, eh!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I feel like all I've been seeing the past few days is people asking if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will be the game that finally brings extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> into the mainstream. No one seems to be quite sure, mostly because it isn't done or out yet. The thing is, it's not the only extraction shooter due out this year that'll put that question to the test, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one the way still too. It comes from former Battlefield devs after all, who have found success with their other shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>. And earlier today, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> announced that another playtest for Arc Raiders is on the way this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Signing up for the playtest is pretty simple on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a>, you just have to head to the game's page and request access to the beta. The test itself is running from April 30 to May 4. Not everyone will be able to try it out, I should note, it's luck of the draw, but if you're feeling lucky and you're curious as to whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream, it's worth a shot.

<p>
In a press release Embark shared that they've taken on a bunch of feedback from the last test, implementing a bunch of "tweaks and improvements." They've also added in more Arc enemies (evil robots that have taken over most of the world), as well as weapons and gear. Player progression and crafting systems are apparently "deeper" now too, and there'll be a preview of what the game's battle pass will be like.
</p>
<p>
I like the vibes of Arc Raiders a lot. Bit of a stereotypical "humans are in hiding in tiny settlements because robots have wrecked the planet" kind of premise, though it looks good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs&amp;ab_channel=ARCRaiders">in motion</a>, and I'm digging its particular flavour of a post-apocalypse setting.
</p>
<p>
That's the thing though, Marathon looks good in motion too, and based on most previews, plays good too. There's some specific complaints people are having about Marathon (namely a worrying lack of content at launch) which raises further questions as to whether it'll be the one to make a notoriously tough genre like extraction shooters popular.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can't say how things will shake out. Games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> are still trudging along quite well, maybe it doesn't need to be a massively popular genre. Guess we'll have an idea by the end of the year!
