            <p>
"BEING A TEENAGER SUCKS. So we made a videogame about it." These are the opening words on the Steam page for Jenny Jiao Hsia's Consume Me, a "life-simulation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" about feeling "stupid, fat, lazy, and ugly in high school." Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and say many of you that are of a post-high-school age probably don't want to re-experience it anytime soon, but Consume Me looks like such a good time I'm going to suggest you do so anyway, especially because it just got a demo.
</p>

<p>
That self-described genre of life-simulation RPG certainly seems apt as the game sees you do things like performing Tetris-esque puzzles to make a well-balanced breakfast, putting make-up on, and walking your dog. It almost looks like an RPG by way of the mundane sections in any of the modern Persona games, said mundanity amped up and sillified to 11.

<p>
Rather than an RPG mechanically though, there's two things it reminds me of first and foremost. One is the WarioWare series, there's a real oddball minigame feel to a lot of what Consume Me appears to offer, even if it's a bit occasionally a bit slower paced than what the greedy yellow-cappedâ€¦ Wario is. It also reminds me of old Flash games - think Newgrounds, Miniclip, Nitrome, that sort of thing, the kinds of games you'd play during IT classes when you were meant to be putting an Excel sheet about the price of eggs together.
</p>
<p>
I'd actually seen a much, much earlier version of the game at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overthinking-games-the-achievable-goals-of-wobble-yoga">the V&amp;A's Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition</a> way back in, cripes, 2019, and was enamoured by it then. It's great to see how far it's come - it even won the IGF Grand-Prize earlier this year! No release date for this one just yet, but you can go ahead and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">wishlist it on Steam and check out that demo anyway</a>.

What do you think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islands-and-trains">Islands &amp; Trains</a> is about? I'm not going to give you long, because it really is just right there in the name. As you've presumably already guessed, it is a quaint-looking sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> where you make tiny diorama-like islands, adorning them with tracks for trains to choo-choo along. I told you, it's a name that does what it says on the tin, and if it appeals to you at all, well, there's some good news, as it just came out today.
</p>

<p>
Islands &amp; Trains for the most part looks like one of those kind of build-your-own screensaver type of games, without the screen saving part. Developer Akos Makovics specifically cited games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> as influences, all titles with a focus on making peaceful places to look at with a hopeful sense of ease. So, if they're up your alley, this one probably will be too.

There's apparently over 400 types of tiles to play around with, lots of variations amongst those too, and you'll notice animals like cows and ducks flocking in as you build up your city. I'm not typically a sandbox builder kind of person myself, and yet looking at it I can't help but harken back to my own childhood playing with my dad's model railway. 
</p>
<p>
He wasn't the kind of model train enthusiast that had all the extremities like sets and tiny trees, so imagination was key to building up a picture. Islands &amp; Trains looks like a nice opportunity to express that childlike sense of train-oriented curiosity. You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/">Steam</a> right now if it takes your fancy.

            <p>A modder is asking for help resurrecting Borderlands Online, an MMO version of Gearbox's comedy gun-runner that only ever saw daylight in China. It was announced in 2014 and shut down in 2015 alongside development studio 2K China, but footage of the abandoned project appeared online earlier this year. Now, intrepid digital archaeologist EpicNNG is trying to overcome "thousands of errors" and restore the MMO to a playable state.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can hear about these mighty ventures in the latest update video, below. The build EpicNNG is working with "has been publicly available for the past 10 years", but was only recently discovered by another modder, Lewis, with the cautionary note that "a lot of the downloads were riddled with viruses". They've now confirmed that "we have got the full game" and "can get in eventually, it is just a matter of when".</p>

<p>That's providing, however, other people pitch in, and EpicNNG is concerned that Take-Two Interactive, 2K Games or Gearbox might block the project ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. "God forbid that happens here, and this gets shut down, and I receive a cease and desist because we're taking away from the marketing of Borderlands 4," the video frets. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, we covered a Stop Killing Games survey which held that around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games with online requirements are doomed</a>. Here's hoping this one returns from the abyss. It's the first I've heard of the Borderlands MMO, and while I've fallen off the series, I'm curious to see how the developers at 2K China reworked the fittings.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">launches on 12th September</a>. Gearbox frontman Randy Pitchford has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">saying daft things about it</a>. He does so love doing that.
