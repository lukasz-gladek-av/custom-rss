            <p>
For all of their faults (the list may be endless), the interesting thing about live service games, when done well anyway, is the way they can change from day to day. There's an actual living quality to them that, even if I'll always prefer them, a singleplayer game can't capture as well. One such game that can change quite drastically is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, with its varying map conditions and events, swapping in and out at the whims of its developers. This rotation isn't something universally loved, but CEO Patrick Söderlund has said that they're here to stay.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a broader interview about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, when asked about Embark's response to those that don't love the rotating schedule of conditions and events, Söderlund explained that they are "on a rotating schedule for multiple reasons. Obviously, we believe that it's a part of how the game should be played, that not everything is available at all times. We believe that creates tension. It's an element of fun. It's a way for us to move people from map to map, which we believe to be important."
</p>
<p>
Söderlund continued to explain how the studio doesn't want all map events to be constantly available, and "that most likely won't change. Sometimes we'll let them stay for longer. Sometimes we run two or three in parallel, but they may be different, but we believe that to be a part of how the game should be experienced." The CEO did also share that while they plan to continue adding more map conditions, some may end up being removed temporarily, with the potential for them to return "with a different edge."
</p>
<p>
This obviously won't be accommodating to everyone, as obviously some will have schedules that constrict the time of day they can play. And there lies the double edged sword of these ever evolving live service games. Mayhaps this reality where FOMO-driven gameplay does not make for entirely great experiences.

            <p>
Last month, Ubisoft pretty unceremoniously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelled a bunch of games</a>, the most notable of the bunch being that long gestating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. This came as part of a major restructuring at the company, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">putting up to 200 jobs at their Paris HQ at risk</a>, ultimately leading to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">call for an international strike</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-fire-assassins-creed-designer-who-spoke-out-publicly-against-return-to-office-as-union-reps-call-for-ceo-to-resign">firing of one Assassin's Creed designer</a>. It's all a concerning mess, and now the creator of Prince of Persia and lead designer on the original Sands of Time Jordan Mechner has shared his sympathy to devs affected by the remake's cancellation.
</p>
<p>
"The remake's cancellation as part of Ubisoft's restructuring was disappointing news to all fans who'd been eagerly awaiting it, myself included," Mechner wrote in a <a href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days">blog post</a> on his personal website (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/prince-of-persias-creator-reacts-to-ubisofts-cancellation-of-the-sands-of-time-remake-having-a-project-killed-is-a-brutal-experience/">PC Gamer</a>). "My sympathy goes to the development team in Montreal; I can only imagine how they must feel. Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It's an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn't often see, but developers are all too familiar with."
</p>
<p>
Mechner also highlighted how damaging this can be for the spirit of younger developers who don't have many shipped games on their CV yet. "It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated, but artists put their hearts into their work."
</p>
<p>
I found this line from Mechner to be highly pertinent: "Memories of nights and weekends spent in studio crunch instead of at home with loved ones, sacrifices that felt worth it at the time, only add to the pain retrospectively once their object ceases to exist." Sure would be nice if this whole system of taking nigh on half a decade plus to make a game just kind of ended at some point!
</p><p>
The Sands of Time remake seemingly wasn't the only notable game to get the axe, as it was also recently reported that an online Assassin's Creed game was in the works, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-online-cooperative-game-originally-spun-off-from-assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">but that's supposedly been canned now too</a>. Anyone else feeling tired? Yeesh.

            <p>
In a few months time we'll be approaching the anniversary of Square Enix realising that actually, their commitment to releasing certain games only on particular platforms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">isn't that good for them after all</a>. These following two years will supposedly have been a time of internal change for the studio, with that translated externally via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Remake games releasing on more than just PlayStation. Perhaps they're finally making smart choices! And then last year, instead of finally showing off something like, I don't know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, which was first revealed four years ago now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">they announced Killer Inn</a>. Okay! And now, you can try it out for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Heading over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/">Steam page</a> allows you to join a playtest taking part this weekend ahead of its early access release next week. No pre-requirements, just click a button, and you're in. But perhaps some context for the uninitiated. You and 23 others find themselves in the titular Killer Inn, where 16 of you are designated as lambs, the rest as wolves. It really is quite like Werewolf, with wolves attempting to sneakily kill the lambs, while the lambs try to figure out who the wolves are.
</p>

<p>
Clues can be left behind at the scene of a crime to be discovered, traps can be set up to trick lambs, and also it looks like just about everyone can have guns to just fully blast each other with. There is a strong Unreal Engine premade vibe to the whole thing, quite honestly, but the overall concept isn't awful, it's just an incredibly strange game for Square Enix to not only publish, but partially make (alongside Tactic Studios). Who knows! This is a streamer bait game if there ever was one, and social games like these are having a big moment right now, so perhaps there's an audience for it somewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you don't manage to try out the beta test, you'll be able to pick it up when Killer Inn releases February 12th, next week.

            <p>
I'll be truthful with you for a moment: I do, from time to time, enjoy a game where I do not have to be supremely strategic, and get to watch different lights and colours light up on my screen. Something that's got the juice, but doesn't ask too much of me. Everyone needs to turn their brain half off once in a while! And I believe I could quite easily find myself switching off that half to STICKER/BALL once in a while, a "pool game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> from the future."
</p>
<p>
Ok, so, I do have to admit that for the first couple minutes of STICKER/BALL's demo, I had to turn my brain on ever so slightly to figure out what was going on, so let me explain it for you here. You have six balls. When a run starts, there is a single die on the screen, so you shoot the die, and get points, of which there's a minimum you have to make each round, increasing upon a successful one. Once the ball comes back to you, you are granted a choice of one singular sticker amongst three, all of which have different effects to get you even more points.

For example, a house sticker spawns a human when you hit it, and said human gives you three points upon spawning, or six if they survive, and eight if they die from getting shot by a bullet. So, you might then want to place a gun sticker on the dice field, of which there are 216 slots, each line unlocking the more stickers you get. You can also choose which stickers go on which numbered die, and they'll randomly appear on the main field, prompting you to determine just where you want to point your ball towards.
</p><p>
The more dice you get, the more opportunities for the ball to bounce around and cause the different stickers to interact with one another. A game of true, honest cause and effect. And as mentioned, one that requires just a smidge of thought, as when there's enough stickers on the field, you can kind of just feel out where it's best to shoot your shot on instinct, resulting in those treasured flashing colours.
</p>
<p>
I think ultimately the game is summarized quite well by the last line of its Steam description: "Enjoy the chaos, it’s on purpose." I will, STICKER/BALL! No exact release date attached to this one, but it's currently slated for release in 2026, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/_STICKERBALL/">here</a>.

            <p>
You know, you'd think that with decades worth of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> in existence, side quests would have been more or less figured out by now. And yet, there are still enough games releasing that seem more interested in going for quantity over quality. But for the devs over at Archetype Entertainment, the goal is to make the side quests in their upcoming sci-fi jaunt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus-2027">Exodus</a> not feel just "tacked on."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/mass-effect-veterans-dont-want-side-quests-to-feel-tacked-on-to-their-new-sci-fi-rpg-and-they-cant-add-everything-or-the-game-would-be-thousands-of-hours/">GamesRadar</a>, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> writer and current Exodus narrative director Drew Karpyshyn explained that side quests are more about "trying to give players the chance to explore what they want to explore, that will add to the main story." He continued, "We definitely don't want you to feel like you're doing it because you're obligated, like 'I need those three points to get my next level on this skill, so I guess I'll do it'. We want side quests to be something you would do even if you weren't getting a reward - you're going to get rewards, of course, it's a game, but we want you to feel like 'This is something I'm interested in, this is something I want to explore.'"
</p>
<p>
Karpyshyn noted that in turn, Exodus' side quests are tied into its themes and companions you may have. "It's tied into interesting aspects of our game that maybe don't get explored as much on the critical path, but you can see them," he explains. For Karpyshyn it's that age old tricky thing of deciding where is best for the team's focus, as they know they can't add whatever they want without the risk of the game becoming "thousands of hours [long], which sounds great in theory, but isn't realistic."
</p>
<p>
Personally, a game that's thousands of hours long sounds like a nightmare to me, so, I'm happy to see some amount of restraint being enacted here. As it currently stands, though, it'll be a while before we find out if Archetype succeed in making good side quests, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exodus-devs-want-you-to-know-that-despite-matthew-mcconaugheys-ai-deal-not-a-drop-has-been-used-in-their-game-so-far">as it's not due out until some time in 2027</a>.
