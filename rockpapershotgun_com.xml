            <p>
Remember how literally only two weeks ago, PlayStation held one of their "Look at the State of the Place, You've Made Such a Mess!" presentations? There were plenty of announcements that landed with suitable aplomb, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-belmonts-curse-sees-dead-cells-devs-bring-back-vampire-whippage-and-konami-say-its-just-the-start-of-a-revival">new Castlevania</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-first-person-walk-around-a-foggy-scottish-town-in-the-90s-silent-hill-townfall-is-certainly-serious-about-instilling-dread">proper look at Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, and a reveal of remakes of the OG three God of War Games. So it strikes me as perhaps a bit odd, and funny, that today Insomniac Games have, with quite little fanfare, confirmed the release date of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> joint.
</p>
<p>
I'm serious, the studio has literally just released a six second video across its socials which literally just shows the date for four of those. Oh, it's September 15th, this year, sorry, forgot that's the important bits, though for us in PC land this means next to nothing as the game will be a PS5 exclusive at launch. But given that all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games eventually made their way to PC, we probably safely assume Wolverine will do much the same.

In terms of when that might be, well, I can make a guess. The first Spider-Man game came out before Sony started their PC porting strategy, but for the second smaller entry, Miles Morales, it took two years to make the jump, and for the full-on sequel the wait was about a year and a half.
</p><p>
It is worth considering the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is getting a PC release next month, less than a year after its PS5 launch, but Kojima Productions aren't owned by Sony like Insomniac are, so that might make a difference. All of this is to say, we should expect to wait at least roughly a year, if not a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Since its announcement, we honestly haven't seen all that much of the action game in, well, action, apart from a short gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-wolverine-at-long-last-gets-a-borderline-uncomfortably-bloody-gameplay-trailer-and-a-ps5-release-window">shown last year</a>. I expect it'll be a good few months before we see anything lengthier, perhaps in a summer showcase, but hey ho, marketing has to do its thing! And I'm sure it'll continue to do its thing when it's our turn to play.
