            <p>Ubisoft workers have raised concerns with company management about <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">a deal</a> with Saudi Arabia to create a free DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> set in the country, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Announced with little fanfare - at least, as far as add-ons for pretty prominent games are concerned - on a Saturday morning last month, the free DLC is set to add a new story chapter set in 9th century AlUla later this year. AlUla is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ula">ancient oasis city and governorate in Saudi Arabia</a>, though Ubisoft's <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735">announcement post</a> didn't mention the country by name.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in this report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot announced the DLC alongside the online reveal during a speech in Riyadh at a conference put on in conjunction with the Esports World Cup, which the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Saudi government are funding</a>.</p>
<p>According to an internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A, which Game File's Stephen Totilo has published as part of his report, workers at the publisher have demanded answers from management about this partnership with Saudi Arabia. The question from a staffer about the issue specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, asking whether Ubisoft execs believed an association with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image.</p><p>While they've publicly told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-staff-reportedly-raised-concerns-about-saudi-arabia-deal-for-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-as-company-insists-it-maintains-creative-control">IGN</a> that they have creative control over what goes into this DLC, Ubisoft reportedly wouldn't tell staff anything about how it came to be, simply stating that they don't comment on "rumours". They did however, make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman, the latter being <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a> and the person who allegedly ordered Khashoggi's assassination. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," Ubisoft management told workers.</p>
<p>The company also defended Guillemot having travelled to Saudi Arabia in late 2024 alongside French president Emmanuel Macron to meet with Saudi politicians. That was just a "classic diplomatic tool for expanding France's influence and reach around the world", according to Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The reported partnership with Ubisoft over Mirage DLC - released at no charge, as is often the case for sizeable add-ons boasting not just new missions, but a totally fresh location to explore - is far from the only gaming-related investment the Saudi government and their associates have made in recent years. Just last week, PIF-backed "giga project" Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">bought co-ownership of fighting game tournament Evo</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now. Our Borderlands 4 review is not, because we have only just been sent a review code. I fear I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">unduly forgiving of Team Cherry</a> last week for not supplying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> code before release - they're a cute, tiny indie, after all, albeit a cute, tiny indie with the power to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-has-murdered-steam">break Steam</a> - so let's take a firmer stance this time: bad! Wrong! Don't you know you're suffocating games journalism, Gearbox and 2K Games, you swaggering chancers? Whither accountability and transparency in a time of choosy PR departments? 
</p>
<p>I should teach you all a lesson by diverting your brand power and googlejuice towards some other game instead. I think I will, actually. What else is on sale today. Ah yes, Try To Drive.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Try To Drive (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">Steam page</a>) is one of those daft multiplayer games that trades on co-op partners repeatedly sabotaging each other. In this case, it's a tandem simulator, a tandem being a bicycle for two people.</p>

<p>Doesn't sound nearly as arduous upfront as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">climbing out of hell</a> while shackled to Nic "We Can Jump Those Lasers" Reuben and Brendan "My Left Not Your Left" Caldwell, but you will not be cycling down any ordinary roads in Try To Drive. You will be cycling along chains of floating biscuits pooped out by gingerbread men. You will be ponderously T-bogging your way over precarious glass accordions.
</p><p>I actually have some firsthand expertise to bring to bear, here, based on sharing a tandem with my life partner. The trick is to put the one with the biggest bum in front. No, I am not going to tell you whether I have a bigger bum than my partner - don't be uncouth. My other top tip is to put a mirror on your handlebar so you can check whether the other rider is goofing off.
</p>
<p>I have run out of tandem expertise to share, so let's circle grudgingly back to Borderlands 4, the game that murdered journalism. My big takeaway from the previewage so far is that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won't be as jokey as the other Borderlands games</a>, apparently because it's set in a totalitarian world, and they want to set a grimmer tone. 
</p>
<p>As some of you noted at the time of that linked report, the idea that humour isn't seemly in this context seems absurd, given that past Borderlands games have already seen us battling against odious corporate bosses and tyrants, while rattling through gags like ammo belts. That said, I do think Borderlands in general could benefit from being less punchline-driven.
</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can tell you only that they want <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">100GB</a> of SSD space for the pleasure, and they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">pondering an $80 price tag</a> at one point. If you're hungry for more, I will grit my teeth and suggest that you cast your eye over <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">this review from Very Gary Computing</a>. They <em>did</em> get code, possibly because they didn't call the studio boss an idiot in any of their news coverage.
</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
