Soberly breaking down the plot, mechanics and presentation of InCARceration would be like trying to cook a meal, win a spelling bee or perform a sneak-attack after being welded inside a car. So I will say only that this is an amusing bizarro take on WarioWare that makes me yearn for other, bizarro takes on WarioWare.</p>
<p>You may find it cathartic if you've had any dealings with obtuse legal systems lately. A Kafkar sim, perhaps. Yeah, that'll do. <a href="https://crayonmelon.itch.io/incar">Play it in a browser here</a>. If you've already tried it, there was an update this week that (possibly?) adds a new ending and does away with some unintended quantum physics.

<p>
The dignity of journalism requires that I drag this news piece kicking and screaming past the 300 word mark, so let me add that the release of InCARceration continues <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">a promising year for unhallowed "carlike" experiences</a>. It was created for this February's automobile-fixated TFR Gamejam, which harbours a few other roadsters of note - the comparatively sheeny <a href="https://mabalobo.itch.io/redshift">RedShift</a>, in which your debt increases when you crash, and the gloomy pizza delivery sim <a href="https://eirye.itch.io/high-road">High Road</a>, of which we may jovially and unforgiveably say "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>-esque, is it? Paratoppings, more like!" You can find the jam on <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-001/rate/3262838">Itch.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
Question for the thread: what makes a minigame collection more than a minigame collection? Decent variety between minigames?  Not actually being called a "minigame collection"? An overarching theme to stop it feeling like you're pointlessly fishing different shapes and colours of marshmallow from a bowl of Lucky Charms? Some actual craft, so that the component games are more like exquisite snowflakes than soggy cereal pieces endorsed by racist leprechaun imagery? Or alternatively, a full embrace of the disposability of minigames? Let the players have their fill of politically incorrect breakfast comestibles. They deserve nothing better.</p>
<p>It turns out RPS has some Background Reading to share. Here's Brendy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-7-most-needless-minigames">the seven most needless minigames</a>, and here's Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/worst-hacking-minigames-ever">sticking it to rancid hacking games</a> in particular.

LiDAR or "light detection and ranging" is a way of working out and picturing the distance to an object by shooting laser beams at it, and timing how long it takes the laser to bounce back to the scanner. It's been used for a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">Hard Science-y purposes</a>, from mapping cave systems to measuring changes in the Amazon forest canopy. It's also become popular among artists, who use it to create high-fidelity yet abstractly coloured and ethereal visualisations of, for example, <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/daniel-coe-lidar-data-river-art/">rivers</a>. Now here's LiDAR Exploration Program, a "relaxing atmospheric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>" game from KenForest, in which you roam maps with a handheld LiDAR gun scanning the geography into being.

I've just been playing the Itch demo, and it's sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> but for ghosts. I'm assuming the game doesn't physically calculate the passage of individual laser beams for the simple reason that my work laptop can run it without shuddering to pieces. Each level gives you a list of individual objects to scan. It certainly works as a chillout play: the landscapes appear to be wholly static, and you can take your time going over every surface, using the mouse wheel to expand or tighten the cone of lasers emitted by your gun. There's an alt-fire on right-click which scans the whole screen from top to bottom. All very methodical and restful. But also unnerving. 
</p>
<p>
LiDAR can't reveal the interior of an opaque object, or anything behind the surface you're scanning. As such, using it to explore a 3D environment involves the repeated discovery that any objects you've painted into existence are hollow when viewed from other angles. In encouraging you to hold yourself and the perspective motionless, the right-click full screen scan also subtly has you thinking that you're printing out a 2D photograph, but then you move, and the flat illustration twitches into three dimensions.

I like the unassuming delicacy of these chills, the way they emerge 'organically' from the central conceit. There are more outright horror touches, mind you: the scanner is the only way to see, and sometimes, it reveals things you'd rather have left in the dark. There's a top-down rotatable level map view on tab which somehow doesn't quite ruin the mood. Studying my luminous forays from on high, I was reminded of Arnie following the Predator's green blood through the jungle.
</p>
<p>
Still, I enjoy the demo more as an artistic tool than a horror game. I like narrowing the beams and drilling a density of detail through trees, then circling around to analyse the quiet violence of my vision as it spills out from more intensely illuminated surfaces, closer at hand, to stray puffs of photons in the depths of the forest. I wish more games drew this much attention to the properties of light.
