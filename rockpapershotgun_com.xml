            <p>This is just a quick write-up, because it's outside office hours, but... Mobius Digital, creators of wondrous virtual orrery and gravitational stageplay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, are making a new game.</p><!--more-->
<p>The "announcement" takes the form of a throwaway line in an otherwise unremarkable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/753640/view/521964845255360514?l=english">Outer Wilds update changelog</a>. Here it be:</p>
<blockquote><p>This minor patch is now out on Steam only, but will be brought to all other platforms except Nintendo Switch in late May. If you’re not on Steam, don’t worry, you’re not missing out! This is a minor patch mainly for adding a couple folks to the credits and fixing two PC-only bugs: clicking out of the game disabling certain inputs (such as the key for the ship’s lock on), which affected streamers in particular, and diagonal movement being faster than normal with mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Why stagger the releases like this? It’s to increase the chance that, if any bad bugs on Steam slipped through testing, they’ll get caught and fixed before the release of the other platforms. This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!</p></blockquote>
<p>After the usual bullet-point round-up of additions and fixes, the changelog post adds that "there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game."</p>
<p>So then. Well now. What could they be up to? Another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>? Further attempts at simulating quantum mechanics and other elements of "post-classical" physics? I am all agog. Thanks to reader Faxmachinen  for spotting it and passing it on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
