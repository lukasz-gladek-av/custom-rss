Sometimes to chill out I watch timelapse videos of ocean creatures such as starfish colonising patches of sea floor. Perhaps they're gracefully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG17TsgV_qI">devouring a seal's carcass</a>, or moving to escape a lethal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcUouLOmQuU">descending finger of ice</a>. Look, I'm quite a morbid guy, but 'beauty of nature' and all that.
</p>
<p>
It turns out there's an equivalent in Warhorse's recent RPG-palooza <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here's a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to gather.

Hypnotic, yes? We could do with this kind of thing in Bethesda games. The Reddit video has now been circulated on the Xeetbox, and Warhorse programmer and open world scripter Patrik Papšo has chimed in with some thoughts about the social systems powering such wholesome feats of litter collection.
</p>
<p>
"Haha, that's an NPC behaviour I made!" he <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890444455028600836">wrote</a>. "They choose what they pick based on the value of the item and their social status. That's why nobles might ignore cheap items, but beggars will pick them up." Under the game's node-based AI system, Papšo <a href="https://x.com/BlueX_ow/status/1890788009802350674">explained</a> in a subsequent tweet, when an NPC sees an object dropped by a player, the system checks its price against the NPC's own "social multiplier", then checks to see if another NPC is already picking it up. 
</p>
<p>
Papšo also has some insights in that tweet thread about roads-not-taken. For example, Warhorse once had a system whereby if you dropped a stolen item, the original owner might spot it and trace the theft back to you. The developers cut this feature, however, because it was too difficult for players discarding dozens of items to make the connection between a particular item and suddenly being accused of a crime. There was also once a bug whereby if an NPC "reserved" an object for collection and the player picked it up first, they might filch it from your inventory instead.
</p>
<p>
The soothing, glacial spectacle of Kuttenberg townsfolk swarming a heap of worn-out gambesons aside, I like all this because I can imagine a game where NPCs actively acquire, exchange or discard objects, and you entertain yourself simply following an object's passage from hand to hand. Imagine somebody nicking your favourite boots early on, and flogging them over the black market. A few dozen hours later, you spy somebody else innocently wearing them while traversing a mountain pass.
</p>
<p>
There's probably a simulation that does this? Right now, I can think only of how dwarves claim items for their own use in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer would like to know if video games journalism is OK. He is concerned that the "whole space is gonna go away or be corrupted by things". He mourns the heyday of magazines, and is bemused by this "SEO" malarkey he keeps hearing about. Much like a Dickensian child holding out a bowl for more gruel, he wants to know if there's still a "path" for "people with a real honest voice".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/">an interview with XboxEra</a>, in which they whimsically "flip the script" by having Big Spencer ask the interviewer a question. I'm quite glad I am not one of XboxEra's interviewers, because if Phil Spencer had asked me this question I would have exhaled so dramatically I would have jet-propelled myself backwards through the wall and into near-Earth orbit.
</p>
<p>
"People who talk about video games, like the state of the game industry, press and community and all of that, it's just in constant evolution," Spencer began. "You see it, just like the industry itself. But I'm just curious, like from where you sit. Should we, as people who are someone who consumes content - I'm on YouTube, I'm reading stuff. How should we feel about the state of people like yourselves who get to talk about video games? Should we be worried that that whole space is gonna go away or become corrupted by things? Like people with a real honest voice? And just who want to kind of talk constructively about an industry they love? Is there a path for them?" 
</p>
<p>
XboxEra writer Jon Clarke responded by talking about the damaging influence of "rage bait" reporting, which he thinks is the "biggest problem that the industry faces across the board". XboxEra don't go in for any of that nonsense, he added.
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I love that," quoth Almighty Phil. "No, I love it because it's something that makes me long for magazine subscriptions, where you subscribe to a magazine and that's kind of where you guys are, right? And it's you're paying on a regular basis for the quality of the dialogue.
</p>
<p>
"But otherwise it's just too.... what do they call it? Search engine optimization or something like that?" he impishly continued. "And I have friends in the industry. I obviously do something different, but as somebody who's looking for kind of balanced discussion, not all positive - we should be constructive and talk about things that aren't working for us as players as well. Sorry to make it a heavy question but it is where my head's at."
</p>
<p>
Let's imagine that, having been launched into near-Earth orbit by my own sighs of despair, I now explosively re-enter the room through the opposite wall, stripped naked by atmospheric winds and coated in a thick melange of mosquitoes and condor poo. There is time, as I somersault through the briefing chamber with dictaphone wildly extended, to scream some rapidfire observations of my own. 
</p>
<p>
"PHIL! Phil. I too miss the days when people paid for video games journalism, regularly or irregularly. I too dislike writing headlines such as What Is Doom: The Dark <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> For Fortnite Fans Free Horses Fast. But Phil, this is the equivalent of the high school bully asking us why we are hitting ourselves. Your company makes <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/">billions</a> from Search! Those "friends in the industry" you allude to have been trying to steal Google's pie for decades and now, they're devising software that turns searching for websites into a process of auto-regurgitating cliffnotes from those websites and cutting off whatever ad revenue we have!"
</p>
<p>
"Avoiding rage bait?" I would continue on my next orbit through the room, now gripping pieces of satellite fuselage and tarred absolutely purple by air friction. "Your company helped invent the concept of "console wars", Phil! I know you prefer the Kumbaya rising-tide-lifts-all-ships rhetoric these days, but it wasn't that long ago that Xbox execs were getting former PlayStation exclusives <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/classic-e3-moments-xboxs-greatest-triumphs/">tattooed on their arms</a>. Talk constructively about an industry we love? How are we supposed to do that when you keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">laying people off</a>?"
</p>
<p>
"Help us bring back the glory days, Phil!" I would shriek, as I disappeared for a third time over the horizon. "Refound Official Xbox Magazine and donate it to the Internet Archive! Go pour glue into Copilot's personality core! Rehire Arkane Austin! Turn Halo Studios into a worker's cooperative! Cede The Coalition to the CBC!" The interview would continue in this staggered fashion until the urgency of my gesticulating finally overpowered Earth's gravity, and I disappeared forever into the last place not corrupted by capitalism.

            <p>Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. </p>
<p>You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not Don't Nod Montreal's Colin McInerney or one of the other hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a game creation jam dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LQoGS0q7ls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The jam runs from Thursday, March 13th to Thursday, March 20th, the 19th anniversary of Oblivion's 2006 launch. Oblivion aside, it takes inspiration from Bass Reeves Can't Die, a game concepted by Strange Scaffold boss Xalavier Nelson Jr, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colin.how/post/3lehstucgq225">created by McInerney</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ukg2BqIk0">promoted/discussed</a> by Youtuber Julian "Noodle" Morley.</p>
<p>"Feel free to iterate on the original persuasion-puzzle concept or abstract your wheel into something entirely new!" <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wheeljam">explains the jam page on Itch.io</a>. "If your wheel is recognizably derived from the Oblivion wheel in any way shape or form, it is fair game."</p>
<p>Entry is free, and the hosts have considerately put together some Unreal, Godot and Unity Engine templates for people to work from. They're also offering prizes in the shape of 3D-printed Oblivion Persuasion Models. From the Itch page: "They spin! And have magnets! Maybe I'll put your names and the categories on the back of the wheel? I dunno! I didn't think that far ahead!"</p>
<p>There are several prize categories. Under "Hotwheels", we file developers who "spend an exorbitant amount of time juicing your wheel, making custom graphics for it, and making it buttery smooth". Under "Reinvent The Wheel", we find those who "use the wheel in a way that even the most seasoned game designers couldn't possibly fathom". And under "Put The We In Wheel", we find developers who "somehow found a way to have multiple wheels".</p>
<p>I'm quite fond of Oblivion's Brainwashing Pizza. I'd love to see another developer randomly revive it as an in-game item - perhaps Kojima can be pie-suaded to build it into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. I also adore gamejams run by sickos who are obsessed with extremely specific features or mechanics from many decades ago. I'll be keeping one eye on this while the other remains peeled for news of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">long-rumoured Oblivion remake</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
