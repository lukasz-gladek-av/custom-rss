            <p>All creative work goes through several iterations before arriving in its final form. This very post, for example, began as a little notice of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a>, before I realised Edwin had already done that. Now it's instead about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, an RPG which Nic definitely described in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">his review</a> as "operatically, hauntingly, and slightly unhingedly French".
</p>
<p>Turns out it wasn't always so, as early in development Clair Obscur was set in "a steampunk Victorian England", and there's some early footage of it in action.
</p>

<p>Five years ago, Sandfall Interactive CEO Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">posted on Reddit</a> in search of voice actors for the project, described at the time as "a 3d modern take on the JRPG genra with western style characters". The project was called "We Lost" and Broche shared early video footage of the game, the original links to which no longer work, though it's available via reuploads.

</p>
<p>One of the people who applied to be a voice actor on the game, Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, went on to instead be its lead writer. In a recent interview, she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a> about how the project changed. "The gameplay would have been similar, but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a call with investors that caused the project the change course. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Guillaume called me, and he's just like, ‘Alright, reboot. We're starting from scratch,’” she said, following a call in which potential investors told them, "You know, you can think bigger, don't hold yourself back just because you're worried about funding. If you could do what you wanted to do, what would you write?"</blockquote>
<p>There are some memorable games set in London already - a city which Nate memorably referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-legion-how-to-talk-like-a-fackin-future-fackin-cockney">"hard mode Paris"</a> - so I'm glad Clair Obscur reached for a more distinct flavour, one that Nic named in his review as "French French FRENCH IT'S FRENCH FRANCE French French French French!". Love that guy's writing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Co-op shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> added its third enemy faction, the Illuminate, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">back in December</a>. Now the alien squids are headed towards Super Earth itself, and to counteract this latest threat to democracy developers Arrowhead are giving soldiers new ways to customise their weaponry.

<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">explained on the PlayStation blog</a>, the new update adds weapon customisation for all primary weapons, letting you complete missions and pay in-game currency to unlock attachments and skins. "Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield," says the post.
</p>
<p>These newly tweakable weapons are proposed as a response to Illuminate heading towards Super Earth, and doing so with newly added enemy types. That includes "the Stingray", a flying enemy that can perform strafing runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>; "the Crescent Overseer", which can drop explosives on Helldivers behind cover; and the Fleshmob, a "Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy."
</p>
<p>"Voteless parts" is good. Good marketing, marketer.
</p>
<p>The in-game store has also been amended to offer items permanently, rather than only a rotating time-limited selection, meaning that you can now go pickup that fascist dandy cape you missed first time around. I like when developers decide to stop preying upon FOMO.
