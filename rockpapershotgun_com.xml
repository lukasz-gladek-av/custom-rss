            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) are set to launch an industry-wide union of video game workers in the U.S. and Canada at this year's GDC. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) will bring together "video game artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The union’s mission is to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, but also to build large-scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry," say the CWA. "Their first issue campaign will be around layoffs – given the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-third-of-developers-think-generative-ai-is-a-negative-for-the-games-industry-says-new-survey">1 in 10 video game developers were laid off in 2024</a>, many video game workers have been mobilized to organize. And now they can! Workers will be sharing around a petition to address the industry-wide layoffs and hope to gain widespread support while at GDC".</p>
<p>If you're attending GDC, you'll be able to pick up a zine they've put together, which includes "UVW-CWA’s mission statement, FAQs, an op-ed on direct-join unionism from CODE-CWA Senior Campaign Lead Emma Kinema, and member quotes". Otherwise, the zine will be available from the <a href="https://code-cwa.org/">CODE-CWA's website.</a></p>
<p>From the zine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights, setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organizers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labor movement."</p></blockquote>

Forthcoming life sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the plucky (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">genAI-ridden</a>) David to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s Goliath - will cost $40 at its early access launch, the developers have announced. What's more, "all updates and DLCs will be provided for free" until the game hits 1.0, according to translated commentary from game director Hyungjun Kim. 
</p>
<p>
This is being styled as a gift unto the gamers, and another way of tempting them from the clutches of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, whose DLC packs commonly sell for full-game prices. The other way of looking at it is that of course early access "updates and DLC" should be free. The point of early access is that you're paying for an unfinished game with the expectation that it'll eventually be worth the money. Also, what's the difference between an update and a DLC? My my, Inzoi, what a can of worms you have opened.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news arrives care of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8">a global showcase</a> last night, which also breaks down the new life sim's early access development - it's launching on 28th March. We can expect four major updates this year, together with new outfits and furniture every three months. Here's an approximate rundown. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Update 1, May</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
New outfits
</p>
<p>
Indoor temperature
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In terms of competing with The Sims, the key addition is probably that mod kit in May. InZoi will need a healthy community of tinkerers if it's to usurp the EA colossus (or perhaps just prosper alongside it - why do I insist on pitting them against each other? Why am I like this?)</p>
<p>I'm also quite interested in the ability to play a ghost - there are 16 ways a character can die in Inzoi, and if you have bad karma when you pop your clogs you'll linger on as a spectre, thwarting the birth of new Zois by, as far as I can tell, contributing to the neighbourhood population cap.
</p>
<p>
Returning to the point about the unfairness of charging for early access DLC - obviously, game development isn't that cut and dried. Perhaps a developer runs into unexpected costs that require them to slap a price tag on an early access update. Perhaps they decide they want to add a player-requested feature they haven't scoped for. Perhaps they really needed to charge more for the base early access game but didn't feel they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Still, I don't like the dilution of the early access concept here. In general, it feels increasingly like developers and publishers view early access as simply a variant of the live service game, with more purchaseables being added over time.
