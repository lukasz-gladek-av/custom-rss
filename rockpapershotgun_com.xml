<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> is one of those forever games where occasionally I'll see that it's released something new and think "dang, that old dog is still truckin' along?" It seems to be that time of year again, as both a big update for the game as well as a new expansion dropped yesterday. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox</a> previously described this as a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">phoenix update</a>" to try and sort out a bunch of the game's long-running issues, as well as make some tweaks to help bring in new players.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, based on some recent Steam reviews since the update dropped, a lot of people seem to be saying it's kind of done the opposite, at least in terms of making the game run better. I'm sure that'll get fixed eventually, the game's nearly 10 years old, I doubt one dodgy update will sink this spaceship. In terms of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823294872846886">update's big changes</a>, the game now groups singular populations by species, strata, and ethic. These groups then produce Workforce, which then get assigned to jobs on your planets.

DLC wise, there's lots of additions there too. You'll find a couple of new biological shipsets, which kind of look like different species of deep sea squid. There's also a new origin called the Wilderness, a "Hive Mind exclusive origin" that requires you to play with a biological ship set.
</p>
<p>
Godzilla and giant space creature lovers alike may also be interested in the new player crisis scenario which lets you breed your very own giant monster. Existentially terrifying, but makes for some cool gameplay.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's new civics like genetic identification and civil education, a new deep space citadel megastructure, an overhauled genetic ascension, and a lot more. Big DLC! Too much to cover here, but that's ok, it just leaves plenty more for you to discover. Or to just read about in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502823913043001850">Steam post</a>.

            <p>Rockstar have released a second trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It's one of those cinematic clip shows of scenes from the game, setting up the story and relationship between dual protagonists Jason and Lucia. It's horny and boring at the same time. Nope, there's still no word on a PC release, sorry. </p>

<p>In the video we see Jason "Do You Even Lift" Duval going to collect his partner in crime (and life) from her stint in prison. Once free, Lucia "Okay One More Butt Shot" Caminos fires many weapons, kicks people, and makes kissy faces at her criminal bae. This is all set to 1986 pop hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NnMl7NUmS8">Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them," say Rockstar on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the studio's website</a>, where they're finally sharing more about the game's story. "But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida â€” forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."</p>
<p>Other characters include conspiracy theorist pal Cal Hampton (basically Jack Black), bank robber Raul Bautista, gangster-to-musician Dre'Quan Priest, and two social media rappers known as Real Dimez. The developers have dumped a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">ton of screenshots</a> of these characters and more.</p>
<p>The trailer follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">the game's recent delay</a>, which pushed the open world crime sim's release date back to May 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
