            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foxhole">Foxhole</a> is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don't play it. It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.
</p>
<p>Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

<p>Dropping bombs on the world below? I get it. Delivering paratroopers behind enemy lines? I love it. I'm less clear on how air-to-air combat works. There's a shot in the trailer of two nimble fighter planes diving and shooting down some bombers operating at a lower height, but I'm struggling to work out how that actually functions as a player action.
</p><p>Otherwise air combat plugs into Foxhole's vast battlefield is obvious ways. It expands the logistical side of the game, as players will need to work to support aircraft production and supply, and "every pilot is a player", as the trailer says, with players also able to play a gunner role onboard. 
</p>
<p>Foxhole Airborne follows on from Foxhole: Naval Warfare, which added ship-to-ship combat and beach landings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/foxholes-massive-naval-warfare-update-is-out-now-adding-gunboats-and-subs-to-its-persistent-battlefield">in October last year</a>. It means that the game will now feature land, sea and air combat all on the same persistent battlefield.
</p>
<p>Lest foot soldiers feel they're being neglected, an infantry update will arrive later this month on November 18th. It aims to revamp combat, with new anti-tank weaponry, close quarters combat, medic changes, and a stamina and suppression overhaul, among others. It sounds like a robust set of changes. You'll find screenshots of that, and of more planes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505460/view/4438953498491486592">in a developer news post over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We'll have a review of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> soon, but I keep making Brendy do other tasks so he's not had enough time yet to ride the rails. That means it falls to me to at least let you know that Frontier's theme park builder is out now.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The sequel's big new feature is the ability to fill your theme park with water, crafting pools and slides alongside your more traditional rides, or combining the two Splash Mountain-style.
</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 was announced back in July and Brendy had a chance to play it at preview in September, where he found it mostly offered the same creative charms as the first in the series:
</p>
<blockquote>Much of what made up the first game returns. The focus is still on creating your own rides and attractions from scratch, rather than relying on pre-made roller coasters and water flumes (though those will still exist for those who prefer to pre-plop). That encouragement to piece things together even goes for the snack kiosks and changing rooms, which can be embedded in the shells of other buildings, like clicking together modular toy models.</blockquote>
<p>The original Planet Coaster led creative and patient souls to craft some truly wild rides, but its reputation as a management game was less positive. I'm curious if Planet Coaster 2 can make the game more appealing to me, someone who can't be bothered to craft an original and physically feasible rollercoaster from scratch, but who does enjoy designing a capitalist hellscape which siphons the money-marrow from customer's wallets. Hopefully Brendy will answer that question next week.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Steam user reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">aren't looking too hot</a>, but you can pick up the game for £40/€50/$50 if you're already convinced.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-the-surprising-genre-twist-of-the-classic-run-and-gunner-is-out-now.1029168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-the-surprising-genre-twist-of-the-classic-run-and-gunner-is-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I would never have predicted there'd be an isometric tactics game based on run-and-gun series Metal Slug, yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is, and I am here for it. We've been following its development for a while but it's out now on Steam, and seemingly as strong as its demo suggested.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Metal Slug Tactics is a tactical RPG, to be specific, as well as a roguelite. You fight your way through squads of enemies to unlock weapons and perks for your own soldiers, with those upgrades persisting across the campaign even if you fail and must repeat specific missions.
</p>
<p>Nic mostly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-tactics-demo-is-pure-nostalgia-for-better-and-worse">praised the demo during June's Steam Next Fest</a>, finding it had more tactical depth than the nostalgic copy-paste he was expecting:
</p>
<blockquote>Every turn each character gets one move and one action, but if you take the action first, you also lose your move. This feels on the more restrictive end as far as action economies go, but you can use "synchronisation" attacks to stretch that economy out, further than a pack of Subway meat over a thousand anemic dirt-loafs. These are special tag-team actions you trigger for free by setting up orthogonal flanking postions. For now, though, it’s just Marco. I can pick between a pistol and a machine gun, but the latter has limited ammo. It’s here I notice some nice quality-of-life bits. You can undo moves and fast forward enemy turns, though there is a restriction on the undo-ing, which I’ll unfurl below like a yellowing lettuce leaf on a stale roll that costs eighteen pounds, or sixteen pounds with ten years' worth of Subway loyalty points.</blockquote>
<p>Nic also took a lot of shots at Subway sandwiches in that article, for he does not acknowledge the glory of the Italian BMT.
</p>
<p>Metal Slug Tactics' demo no longer seems to be available - boo - but the game itself is currently £18.89/$22.49/€22.49 with a 10% launch discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
