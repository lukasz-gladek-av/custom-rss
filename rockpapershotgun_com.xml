One of my favourite anime shows is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlrPO6dBaxw">Sakura Quest</a>. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Hoshino needs to persuade 100 residents to attend the festival by gathering clues about their "quirks and desires". Some of these clues are found online, care of a gorgeous Y2K web browser that harbours a few minigames. Others must be uncovered using Hoshino's low-key Sherlockian capabilities. "A tossed-aside cigarette butt tells a story, and the fragrant scent of trees hides the sneaky presence of a mosquito," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107530/Danchi_Days/">the Steam page comments</a>. Confound you, trees! When the day of the festival comes, we will chop you down for firewood. Providing we get permission from the council.
</p><p>
Danchi Days takes inspiration from auld Japanese console delights like Earthbound and Moon Remix RPG, but it's also semi-autobiographical - based on developers sandy powder and Melos Han-Tani's experience of living in a real-life danchi, with art from illustrator mogumu. It's being published by Analgesic Productions, whose other works include the amazing and perpetually overlooked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> games. I'm hoping the new game's apartment block doesn't harbour anything like Anodyne 2's desertNPC.

Keen? It's not out for a while - sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch up on Sakura Quest. Don't miss the multiple episode arc about the fight to extend the local bus route.

            <p>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian">Fantasian</a> was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit's exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> for us PC heads, calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian-neo-dimension">Fantasian Neo Dimension</a>. It's actually out today, too, if you're interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension has you play as Leo, who awakens in a strange land filled with machines and zero recollection of how and why and who. Soon he discovers that the machines are suffering from a virus called "Mechteria" that's really not a good thing for humans or robots alike. And so, it's up to you and your pals to engage in turn-based fights and free the world from the virus.</p>

<p>Fantasian's neat spin on turn-based battling lies in how you're able to target multiple enemies, whether that's in a straight line, or in an arc, or in large AoE blasts. You're also able to 'collect' random encounters as you're exploring out in the world, so you can fight them all at once for a large cash-in when it suits you - an excellent time-saver.</p>
<p>And on the world front, it's rather nice eh? It blends handmade dioramas with CG, which gives exploration quite the striking aesthetic.</p>
<p>If you're a longtime fan who knows all this stuff and wants the lowdown on the new features, I've got you. There's new Japanese and English voice overs, new difficulty options, 4K resolution, and the option to switch the battle music from the original soundtrack to songs from across the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
