            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> might have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">launched buggier</a> than a holiday at a nature reserve dedicated to cockroaches and coders, but since that point Team FOLON’s put a lot of effort into making sure people can enjoy the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">pretty damn good game</a> it’s created. While you’ll have to wait a bit longer for some Londony DLC, you can now play some of the mod in VR.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/747?tab=description">Fallout: London VR mod</a> is available to grab right now in beta form via Nexus Mods, having been developed by a team led by modder Asciimov. So, it hasn’t come from Team FOLON directly. That said, Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter has shouted it out via an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1377617569514782831">Team FOLON’s Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>“Please note that this is a community-made and unofficial mod by Asciimov's  ‘Fallout: London VR’ modding team,” Carter wrote, “Team FOLON does not provide any support for this.</p>
<p>“This mod and its conversation system are still in beta, as only around 10% of the quests (one main storyline) have currently been tested, but at the moment all known game breaking bugs have been fixed.” So, you can at least get started with your virtual reality trip to the city of baked beans, bowler hats, and blokes who sound like Michael Caine.</p>
<p>Carter also headed any questions folks might have about the Fallout: London DLC that Team FOLON’s <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">working on</a> off at the pass, adding: “If you are expecting us to announce the DLCs, they are still in the works and coming soon.” Cool.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the Fallout: London VR mod a go, the list of requirements is on its Nexus Mods page. You’ll need <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> with all DLC, Mod Organiser 2, Fallout 4 Script Extender VR version 0.6.21, and - unsurprisingly - Fallout: London. The Fallout: London VR team also has its own <a href="https://discord.gg/7xCQMU8CJ2">Discord server</a> you can head to for help troubleshooting issues that don’t have potential fixes outlined already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s latest patch, version 1.01.1, makes the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> somewhat easier for single player Nightreigners. It boosts the number of runes awarded for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-guide#how-to-play-solo">Nightreign solo expeditions</a>, and gives you one free automatic revive per boss battle. A great day indeed for people who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">wish the game's multiplayer were still more in-game covenant than feature</a>.</p>
<p>By strange coincidence, the odds that I will actually play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> have now gone up 1.011 times. I was pretty disenchanted by Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a>, in which he summarised the game's Extended Fromverse battle royale bum-rushing as "a stripped-off part of FromSoft's creative identity with little appeal absent the whole". If they can significantly decrease the reliance on jolly cooperation I'll be much more interested - I had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-is-the-secret-long-lost-cousin-of-metal-gear-solid-5">similar feelings</a> about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - though this still feels like a game I'm comfortable skipping.

<p>
It's not just you chum-deficient Let Me Solo Her-mits who are benefiting from the latest patch. From Software have also done minimum-spec players a solid by sorting out a bug that caused rendering problems on low graphics quality settings. What's more, they have "fixed a bug where the Climb up action sometimes failed when using the keyboard", and "a bug where the Climb up action was difficult to perform when using a gamepad". Sing out if this particular fumble has ever cost you a match.
</p>
<p>
All that's in addition to some rebalanced rewards: you'll be able to earn more high-rarity Relics when reaching expedition day 3, and it's now more likely you'll obtain those high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones bought at the Small Jar Bazaar. You can read the full patch notes, including a list of smaller bugfixes, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">over yonder</a>.

<p>If you are hell-bent on facing Elden Ring Nightreign's various murderbeasts all on your lonesome, allow me to take your elbow and usher you towards our round-up of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-solo-character">best Elden Ring Nightreign solo characters</a>. Ollie Toms died a million times researching that piece. I see the souls of his slaughtered past selves lurking behind his eyes, raking their fingernails against the glass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
