            <p>Good news, people who're still interested in giving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> a go for reasons that don't involve gleefully watching as a poor NPC undergoes a sudden glitchy elongation. Developers Build A Rocket Boy have just pushed out the first in a series of updates designed to swat a bunch of the performance and crash-related issues that've plagued the game's launch.
</p>
<p>If you were busy with other hobbies such as arctic exploration or hardcore spelunking earlier this week, the GTA/Cyberpunky Mindseye suffered a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-launches-to-clips-of-atvs-glitchily-spaghettifying-a-bloke-named-seb-but-a-patch-is-on-the-way">pretty nightmarish debut</a>. The user reviews weren't totally negative right out of the gate, but it's fair to say it didn't land in the fashion ex-Rockstar bigwig Leslie Benzies' studio probably hoped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue the release of today's <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933482714444730741">first hotfix</a> for the game, which has arrived "on an expedited timeline as the first in a series of patches" designed to address the myriad of technical issues players have been having and act on their feedback.</p>
<p>Out now on PC and PS5, with Xbox soon to follow, the patch includes "CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimizations" - as part of that last bit, the memory leak that had been identified as the cause of a number of different crashes has been rectified. Build A Rocket Boy have also introduced new "pop-up warnings" on PC that'll tell you if Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling is disabled or if you've got a machine with a CPU which has "potential crash issues". I assume these pop-ups'll be something like little text boxes that say 'uh oh'.</p>
<p>The hotfix makes MindsEye's CPR mini-game easier, in what could be construed a as wonderfully ironic metaphor for the situation the game's ended up in performance-wise. It also adds in the ability to mess around with the depth of field, and fixes issues with "missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games".
</p>
<p>"Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time," Build A Rocket Boy pledge in the hotfix's notes, adding: "We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if these efforts are enough to turn the game's fortunes around, with first impressions being as important as ever for games, regardless of whether they've got ex-GTA bloke buzz.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
