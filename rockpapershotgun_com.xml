            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a> has attracted a fair few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> comparisons for its sci-fi squad combat and romanceable companions since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">announcement last month</a>. Not least from developers Owlcat themselves, who've namechecked the "iconic" RPGs as inspirations. In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons">recent interview with Polygon</a>, creative director Alexander Mishulin said he's humbled, but that Osiris Reborn also has its own approach to choice, consequence, and storytelling  that's a bit different from Bioware's sci-fi trilogy and also the other one (Andromeda was actually pretty solid though).</p>

<p>"Some [people] get into the industry of making games because they saw [Mass Effect] and were inspired. So it would be impossible to deny that Mass Effect had a lot of impact on us as game developers," Mishulin told Polygon. “On the other hand, it’s an Owlcat Games game and it’s different in many ways. We make our story a little bit differently. We’re making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency.”</p>
<p>Which I choose to interpret as him very diplomatically calling Mass Effect's morality system a bit naff, at least in comparison to the CRPG lineage Owlcat are used to working with in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warty Thou: Rogue Trader</a>. Which, fair, but also choices like "do the horrible Genophage and annoy your best Krogan mates or don't do that" felt monumental at the time. </p>
<p>"If you happen to be playing a character of Mars origin or Earth origin — and you will be able to select your origin from the start — you will not be very welcomed on Ceres because of those events," Mishulin offers as an example of how your character's background will set the stage for future encounters. But if you're playing as a Belter in the same situation, there'll more "opportunities, more places to visit, probably some new side quests and everything".</p>
<p>Owlcat aren't "modernising" Mass Effect, Mishulin goes on to say, "just making a game in the same genre but with all the modern trappings."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/owlcat-welcome-mass-effect-comparisons-with-their-expanse-rpg-but-say-theyre-approaching-choice-and-consequence-differently]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's the open environments of tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/every-day-we-fight">Every Day We Fight</a> that have most caught my eye. Huge warehouses, bases, and ruins so stuffed with cover and walkways as to suggest the dominant species on the game's pre-alien invasion earth were sandbag piles. These sprawling layouts aren't just for show or getting a nice height advantage, either. The city is explorable between battles with your gang of resistance members, letting you poke around and scavenge before sneaking into optimal positions for the next scrap against invading aliens.</p>

<p>My own personal reaction to realising I'm trapped in a time loop would be the Bill Murray approach, i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/dTbGzGQCe-o">inserting large slices of cake</a> into my mouth, to the audible disgust of Andie MacDowell. Here, you'll be using it to your advantage by learning the location of useful discoveries for subsequent runs. These roguelite bits also make themselves known through a sort of push-your-luck heat meter, where subsequent fights get tougher and enemies more numerous, but also offer better rewards.</p>
<p>The executive producer on the game is YouTube tactics man ChristopherOdd, who I credit for making me markedly less rubbish at XCOM many years ago by offering the simple but transformative advice to prioritise finishing off aliens over everything else - the thinking being that one stray shot from one lowly sectoid can feasibly still kill your best guy. Good advice! Here's him narrating <a href="https://youtu.be/UGywygR2oLA">the game's feature overview trailer</a>. I should also point out how much I appreciate this kind of calm, epic strings-free explanation of what a game actually is. Good trailer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrival of the Rifters brought the world to a standstill, but life goes on for your fighters. Uncover their checkered pasts as they learn to work together. Unveil the mystery of the alien invaders and their control over time as you fight through the streets of a once-beautiful city to reveal the full truth about the war. Your resistance grows stronger with each success, and with each failure – after all, death is only the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every Day We Fight should be on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546080/Every_Day_We_Fight/">Steam in early access</a> by the time you read this, unless you've somehow snuck in the RPS content management system, in which case: get out! The lingering scent of bumeggs and Peter Monyleux squirming is ours to enjoy alone.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publishers-time-loop-tactics-rpg-every-day-we-fight-is-out-today-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>
