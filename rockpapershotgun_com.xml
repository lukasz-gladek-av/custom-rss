            <p>Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/10-dead-doves">10 Dead Doves</a> when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">she wrote about it</a> back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. I have been pigeonholed.</p>

<p>Distinct from the implied narrative conceit mainly revolving around poisoned chips, 10 Dead Doves opens with Marcus - “the Most Pathetic Man on Earth” - going backpacking on the Appalachian Trail with his buddy Sean, searching for an urban-legendary place called “The Ant Farm”. Presentation is all medium poly papercraft and fixed angles, tank controls and all. It’s very odd and very fun. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/">demo here</a>, by the way.</p>
<p>This is likely part cop-out and part time constraints, but I feel the highest praise I can give what I’ve played of 10 Dead Doves is that I don’t feel I could adequately do it word-justice in anything less than a much longer article. I will say this: while I do not feel it’s attempting to be the indie game equivalent of an A24 film in any way, I do <em>feel</em> that my fellow A24 wankers will likely appreciate it. I’d compare it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a>, almost, in the way it uses the sort of camera techniques, spatial tricks and disorientating artistry that feel like they’re film specific, but are actually implemented in ways only a game could pull off.</p><p>If this sounds overly worthy or highfalutin, I should say that it’s also just very funny. Nothing sums up the scrappy avant-garde approach better than the devs singing the game title acapella over the splash screen. Some of the language used in the more eldritch sections is winkingly baroque, and the way the character’s faces dart jarringly between distinct expressions is brilliant. I actually didn’t finish the entire demo since I plan to grab this on release, but it’s shot right up for me as a must-play for the year. It’s a Columbidae-te, then. One for the massive cross section of ornithology enthusiasts and indie horror fans, that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Complete <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>'s Space Age DLC and - feelings of acute megalomania aside - you will be able to upload a snapshot of your game to the "Galaxy of Fame", this being a digital night sky from which your cataclysmic industrial exploits shall gaze down eternally, for the instruction and/or disillusionment of tomorrow's factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The star map, which you can check out <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434">here</a>, is developer Wube Software's "last little surprise for Space Age", which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorios-space-age-expansion-is-out-now-adding-asteroid-factories-frostpunky-iceworlds-and-rotting-jungles">launched earlier this week</a>. You'll be prompted to upload your game to it once you've reached interstellar space. It lets you save general map info, such as time played, together with a chart view of planets and platforms and your item, energy and kill stats. You can update your solar system once you've enshrined it for posterity, but be aware that each player can only have one star at once.
</p>
<p>
"You can browse around and see other peoples factories and see how they work," the developers continue. "You might notice that some of the maps look a bit suspicious, well at this time we aren't blocking saves that use cheats/commands/editor, as we don't want to be overly restrictive, but we will add some filtering options soon." 
</p>
<p>
I'm posting this partly because a lot of people are playing Factorio right now - the Space Age DLC has gone down a treat on Steam - and partly because I enjoy fanciful attempts at preserving player accomplishments in games. The Galaxy of Fame reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_(video_game)">Noctis</a>, the amazing experimental space exploration sim with some of the loveliest prismatic effects I've ever seen in a game.</p><p>Released over two decades ago, it allowed players to name the planets they discovered and share them in the form of an old-school database. You can still <a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">download those files with the app and visit the worlds in question</a>. I wonder if Factorio's cyclopean assembly lines will command similar nostalgia, in 20 years time.

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">"beautifully designed yet imprecise platforming adventure"</a> Tales Of Kenzera: Zau are working on an Afrofuturist gothic-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with isometric visuals and a body-sharing dual character premise. Currently known as Project Uso - the Swahili word for 'face', 'appearance' or 'surface' - it'll take place in the same world as Kenzera, and will take inspiration from Surgent Studio founder Abubakar Salim's experiences of parenthood. Providing, that is, the developers can find enough money to make it.</p><!--more-->
<p>"As soon as my daughter was born I knew what I wanted to cook," Salim (who is otherwise known as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed: Origins) told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer</a>'s Ed Nightingale yesterday. "This idea stems from this question of 'who am I?' Zau was a question of 'who am I without a parent?' This is essentially looking at 'who am I now as a parent?' I really wanted to make this very dark and visceral, a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy." </p>
<p>In Project Uso, you play a kind of android vampire called the Solost, who exists to hold the souls of the deceased, but who is also the vessel for Eshu, a trickster god from Banshu mythology. You'll get access to the powers of both the android and its divine passenger, but they'll sometimes disagree. When this happens, you'll have to carry out a Crucible Check - a dice roll battle, seemingly - to decide who gets control of the Solost's body. According to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s report, the overall experience is redolent of Disco Elysium, the Batman Arkham games and Resident Evil.</p>
<p>I've never played Tales Of Kenzera, but the shift away from platforming and into the more writing-led RPG genre makes sense, based on Alice B's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">review</a>. "Tales Of Kenzera shows great precision in its character and world design, in the writing, in the voice acting, even down to individual animations," she wrote. "But it lacks precision in some areas of the combat, in particular the platforming, which arguably is the bit that matters more in a platformer." Still, Alice B went on, "I'd like to see what other tales can be told in Kenzera".</p>
<p>It sounds like Salim has plenty more to tell. "Where else can we pluck from and play that could be really exciting within this space?" he comments in the Eurogamer story. "I designed it that way as a whole." </p>
<p>If there's room for the setting to grow, however, there isn't necessarily the means. Surgent are pretty hard up at the minute. Kenzera doesn't appear to have sold well, prompting Surgent to make layoffs in July. With Project Uso still early on in development, the company's games division is "on hiatus" while they try to rustle up some funding. It's an especially bitter predicament given the racism Surgent Studios had to face down from some quarters over Kenzera's protagonist and setting.</p><p>I hope Surgent can pull things together. Characters who share bodies are always entertaining, and I'd love to play more RPGs inspired by Afrofuturism. I'm a bit less convinced by Salim making a game about fatherhood, simply because this is an emotive gambit I associate with triple-A dudes who no longer wish to be associated with their previous gory action games, but that's mostly just me being cynical.

            <p>Real ones know that the only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/x-com">XCOM</a> spin off worth its salt is Hasbro’s 1999 play-by-mail banger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM_(email_games)">First Alien Invasion</a>, although that didn’t stop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> studio Irrational from getting to work on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series’ universe after being acquired by 2K in 2006. If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bureau-xcom-declassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a>, but Irrational co-founder and current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wild-bastards">Wild Bastards</a> studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project. Kaiju ambitious.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/exploring-the-twisted-road-of-irrationals-doomed-xcom-game-from-fighting-aliens-the-size-of-entire-city-blocks-to-a-multiplayer-mode-where-you-could-be-the-aliens/">Speaking to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer</a>, Chey says the initial spark was "What if XCOM wasn't a turn-based game? What if you were one of the operatives, as opposed to just clicking on a map with them?" It’s a thought that might seem risible to purists, but looking back on that old trailer with the appreciation I have for Irrational now, I can’t help but see much of the backlash as a reaction not to the game itself, but to the fact that XCOM hadn’t had a strategy entry since, well, Microprose's 1999 play-by-email banger First Alien Invasion.</p>
<p>After releasing two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/freedom-force-pc-retrospective">Freedom Force</a> games, designer Ed Orman says that they’d "realised, with the advent of first-person, that turn-based was a bit of a niche. You're not going to hit the big numbers. And we were working on BioShock, which is a first-person shooter. So if we're doing that, why don't we have a crack at a first-person version of XCOM?"</p>
<p>An initial concept was to translate the idea of managing a squad into an FPS, says Chey.</p>
<blockquote><p>"First-person shooters have really struggled with the notion of managing a group of people. You have your AI companions who run around in front of you and get shot, or they run off and do something else, or they kite the enemy into attacking you when you don't want them to. It's very, very hard to make them behave sensibly and give you a feeling that you're managing them and not get overwhelmed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Another idea was the aforementioned Kaiju, he continues, though this was eventually abandoned because "we felt it was getting too far away from what XCOM was supposed to be about”.</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole game would be about the scale disparity, that you were little human soldiers. The aliens have brought these huge creatures as part of their invasion force, and your job is to take them out. And you have to do that by actually, Shadow of the Colossus style, getting onto them and running around, planting a bomb at the base of their spine to blow their head off.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the response to the creature designs shown in that E3 trailer, Chey says "People who loved XCOM wanted to see the same creatures from the tactical game in first-person, and duke it out with a Muton and a Sectoid. They may not be the most original monster designs ever, but they're part of what people love."</p><p>Chey eventually left Irrational in 2009, and the project became The Bureau. Do read the full PC Gamer piece for more. "The Bureau, swiftly stripped of its thematic threads and charm, begins with a dismal and disheartening room by room tour of dull third person shooting, sectoid bullet sponges and explosive barrels," was wot Adam Smith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-bureau-xcom-declassified">thunk at the time</a>. "As squads are introduced and tactical options expand, the game finds its feet, but they are encased in heavy workboots rather than natty dress shoes. Even at its best, The Bureau stumbles from mission to mission rather than striding". Hey, at <a href="https://youtu.be/nF_Ca45JRFs">least some people had fun</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
