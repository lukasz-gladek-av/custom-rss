            <p>
Earlier this week you may have seen what was framed as a <a href="https://x.com/SuperSisi/status/1996855092734230658">leaked trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4. Admittedly, thanks to Dwitter compression and supposedly being a recording of a screen rather than direct capture, it looked convincing enough, as long as you don't look too hard at it. There's that pesky thing called "Ay Eye" going around these days though, so you should never trust something right off the bat these days. Now, as confirmed by Shenmue developer Ys Net, it turns out that that footage has nothing to do with them, and may even lead to legal action.
</p>
<p>
The developer explained in a statement posted to Zitter that they have "confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an official 'Shenmue 4' related video produced by us. This video has absolutely no connection to Ys Net. Furthermore, at this time, Ys Net has not released any trailers, footage, or other promotional materials related to 'Shenmue 4'."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Ys Net went on to note that because of the "unauthorized" use of their logo, making fake trailers like this "constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," and that as a result they are considering "potential legal action." Yikes!
</p>
<p>
Fake trailers obviously aren't a new thing, there have been plenty over the years that range in convincingness. This one, though, looked a bit skewy in a number of places, so it's entirely possible the fake Shenmue 4 trailer is entirely AI-generated. Which obviously raises a bit of a conundrum: how is anyone, even big successful studios like Rockstar who are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">facing a similar problem</a>, meant to combat this?
</p><p>
All of these AI-generated video tools are obviously training on media it does not have the rights to, so that people can do dull things like make Homer Simpson fight Naruto or something (just go play Fortnite). But if these tools suddenly stop letting people work with copyrighted materials, their popularity, and those revenue, will dwindle, so of course they can't do that.
</p>
<p>
Either way, right now, whether this trailer used AI or not, Shenmue 4 isn't currently real as far as we're concerned. Though maybe if we ask nice enough, Ys Net will give it a go making another one.

            <p>
In an ideal world, none of us would have to be bound by the rope called copyright, we could produce all the media we want about our favourite things, like that Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisend and Cinderella ship I have now likely made many of you aware of. Alas, this is not the world we live in, and because of that fact the team by the upcoming mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> Classic is having to rename it after a bit of a prompting from the original game's creators, Valve.
</p>
<p>
"As most of you pieced together quickly, Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic," the modding team explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040">Steam post</a> over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
"When we submitted our demo for Steam Next Fest, the review process was held up on IP rights. This was expected, and it had already happened to our main app, so we contacted Valve to get it cleared up. Upon doing so, we were met with the request to rename our mod. We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September."
</p>
<p>
Not being able to launch the demo led to the team focusing on the mod's rebrand, though apparently deciding on a new name was pretty tricky. Namely that was because they couldn't really find any other word apart from "classic" that conveyed what it needed to, and fit the same acronym of TF2C. 
</p><p>
Despite "Classified" not being considered seriously as a name to start with, as time went on, its double meaning, with the word's origin "classify" evoking "'to make something classic" and its literal definition," that lended itself well "into the spy film theming that early TF2 had carried," meant that it ultimately won out in the end.
</p>
<p>
Alongside all of this rebranding is one more bit of news, however: the mod has been delayed to January 30th, 2026. It's not the new name that's led to this, by the way, it's a few different reasons, including the classic need for more polishing and testing, but also because it'll need to go through the Steamworks review process.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about this mod yet, the main focus of it is to bring the classic (word choice purposeful) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more in line with its original inspirations and tone, bringing back things like some cut weapons and Multi-Team maps, as well as completely new features like new gamemods, items, and visual enhancements.

            <p>They might <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">not have committed</a> to making any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> ending the canon one, but the folks behind Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> have been quick to decide they'd like to get started on filming a third series as soon as they can. Summer 2026, if all goes well, so the radioactive glow of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">imminent second series</a> hasn't totally faded to background levels by the time a follow-up drops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So said executive producer Jonathan Nolan in a recent chat with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer">Ian Games Network</a>.</p>
<p>"With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," the producer outlined. "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all." He then added: "I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend. You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>Well, the conundrum outlined in that last bit sounds <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">similiar to another medium</a>, especially as the last couple of Fallout entries grow more and more distant in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>As it is, I'm not surprised that having been given the green light earlier this year Fallout's showrunners are keen to keep pressing on while they've got momentum. It's not like they'll need time to decide the basics of where the third series will go either, having sketched out some stuff all the way up to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fallout-tv-star-says-his-characters-plot-has-been-planned-up-to-at-least-season-5-or-6/">fifth or sixth season</a> according to Maximus actor Aaron Moten.</p><p>I am interested to see which location's next on the road trip list of Lucy and co, with the series now having done arguably the two biggest stops on the non Bethesda-developed Fallout tour - California and Nevada. Maybe it'll be off to the Midwest for some Fallout: Tactics deep cuts.</p>
<p>I jest, but to be honest if the trend of revisiting locations is set to continue, it'd be nice to see an entry that isn't already given prominent billing given a bit of a spotlight. I mean, most of the gear and props will likely still be made to look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-ish in the name of corporate synergy, but hey, I'm used to that by now.</p>
