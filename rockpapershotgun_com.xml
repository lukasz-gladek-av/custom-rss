            <p>
Look, we all know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> is a weird little series. You can torture your Sims, meet fairies and werewolves and vampires, have half alien babies. So I feel like I shouldn't be all that surprised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion pack, Adventure Awaits, seeing the return of imaginary friends. And yet here I am, taken aback and slightly horrified by the game's interpretation of imaginary friends in its first gameplay trailer.
</p>
<p>
I truly find them existentially uncomfortable. Imaginary friends come in the shape of four different dolls that can morph into humanoid creatures that will keep your Sim child company if no one else will. You can choose between four different personalities for them too, which includes Goofball, Creative, Competitive, and funniest of all, straight up Evil.

<p>
Worst of all, if your Sim child bonds with the imaginary friend enough, they can Pinocchio-style turn into a real human. A lot of ethical questions being raised here I'm not confident the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game will answer, and quite honestly I don't know if I'd want them around my own kids (NB: I don't have any, but let's imagine I do for this joke to land).
</p><p>
That's not what the expansion pack is solely about, though, in fact it's mostly not about getting your children to create human life. Adventure Awaits also introduces three new neighbourhoods for your Sims to explore, with activities like fishing in mountain streams, sharing campfire stories, or just having a romantic retreat. This comes with a new feature, Scheduling Getaway, which allows your Sims to plan weekend trips or summer holidays. Alternatively, with the game's new Custom Venues and Getaway System, you can make your own getaway spots for your Sims to hang out in.
</p>
<p>
At least those retreats sound like a nice reprieve from the horrors presented by the imaginary friends. In any case, Adventure Awaits is out October 2nd, so you don't have to wait very long.

            <p>Have you brought batteries for your torch? Good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s Deep of the Night update's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">primed to arrive in the wee hours of tomorrow, September 11th</a>, and there's a pretty hefty balancing patch to dissect before it arrives.</p>
<p>I've cracked <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">the notes</a> open already and I'll be honest, I'm a bit surprised. Well, maybe concerned is the best way to put it. You see, the word increased is used an awful lot in relation to stuff you can do hurt an enemy. That seems fishy. Just what have you got planned to make lives miserable again once Deep of the Night drops at 2:30AM BST, FromSoft?</p>

<p>Let's start with version 1.02.2's batch of changes to each of the Nightfarer classes aside from Ironeye, who's presumably been left out because he must already be perfect. Wylder's gained more poise while casting claw shot, which now dishes out more stamina damage to blocking foes. The strength and dexterity gains Guardian earns on levelling up have been boosted, as has the range of their steel guard passive.</p><p>Duchess' dexterity gain on level up has also risen, some of her dagger attacks are more powerful, and her finale ultimate art has had its duration lengthened. The trade-off is a decrease in her two-handed dagger’s second heavy attack damage. Raider's greataxe and great hammer-induced stagger, Recluse's Magic Cocktail spells, and Executor's cursed sword attacks have all gotten more effective. Oh, and you can now walk straight through Revenant’s spirits, Helen and Frederick. I'm not sure whether that last one counts as a buff or nerf - let's call it a quirk.</p>
<p>On top of that, the stagger damage inflicted by dual-wielded jump attacks has been boosted across the board for small and medium arms, while it's been dialled down for larger weapons.</p>
<p>Flipping across to the everdark sovereigns, the famously tough Equilibrious Beast has gotten the most adjustments. "We have confirmed an issue where condemned Nightfarers summoned during this fight may not be rendered under specific conditions," Fromsoft also note in relation to that boss, promising to address that problem down the line. Aside from that, Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight look to have gotten slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>The Night’s Tide will also now dish out more damage after you beat the second night boss. A PC-specific tweak worth noting is that FromSoft reckon they've improved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s stability "in some environments", so hopefully you'll find things run more smoothly in the Deep of the Night.</p>
<p>Right, there we go. Best of luck rolling in the deep. Assuming you've not jumped in early thanks to mods.</p>

            <p>Historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> will get new culture mechanics in its 2.0 update, developers Oxide Games and publishers Stardock have announced. As with culture features in certain Civilization games and - well, the only other specimen that comes to mind right now is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins Of A Solar Empire</a>, this will allow you to claim territory without firing a shot, by dint of being way fancier and more refined than all those yokels across the border. Should the aforesaid yokels remain unmoved by your splendour, there's also a new Agitator unit that can be sent into foreign parts to foment rebellion.</p><!--more-->
<p>Agitators aside, the Revolutions update introduces a bunch of military units specific to each civ, such as Japanese Samurai and Mongol Horse Archers, and treats leader characters to a revamp with distinct traits and abilities.</p>
<p>They've introduced more "realistic natural resource clustering" for map generation together with revised rules for trade, and boldly claim to have made the AI smarter. But returning players may be most beguiled by the hot and spicy talk of cutting down on micromanagement. They've replaced the old production queues with "smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy". Filth!</p>
<p>All of which sounds like it might go some way towards addressing Sin's criticisms in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">Ara: History Untold review</a>. "Empire-building re-envisaged as managing elaborate production chains, then re-re-envisaged as another 4X with repetitive micromanagement and weak, bland AI," was her brusque summary. It sounds like the bulk of the audience agreed, for the Revolutions update boasts of being heavily inspired by player feedback.</p><p>How does Culture work in Ara? It's a new quality of life category that generates Influence, this being a currency that can be spent on cultural traits and territory expansion, saving you the need for armed invasion. The Agitator unit is the basis for a second form of conquest that becomes available in the game's second act: ideological subversion.</p>
<p>According to Stardock CEO and Oxide co-founder Brad Wardell, these new methods of assimilation are partly designed to liven up the lategame, once the whole map has been exposed and the rival civs are fairly entrenched.</p>
<p>The update will make some technical improvements - "a sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options" plus "major engine optimizations [that] deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage". It's out 24th September, but there's a beta version available now - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338294049112358?l=english">read more on Steam</a>, where Wardell has also posted some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/507338927350218798?l=english">lengthy reflections</a> about the workings of strategy game AI.</p>
