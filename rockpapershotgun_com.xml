Folk Emerging describes itself as a turn-based 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, but in practice, it's possibly more of a 2.5X strategy game, in that it puts you in charge of a nomadic hunter-gatherer community from before the rise of agriculture and the founding of towns and cities. 
</p>
<p>
As this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">developer update suggests</a>, it's like the turn or two at the very start of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization</a> when you just have one Settler unit, but stretched out across thousands of years, with a social element and rustic spreadsheet aesthetics that remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. It's got somewhat doofy cartoon Stone Age muzak, but is otherwise the most intriguing Civlike strategy game I've laid eyes on since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/4x-strategy-game-entrotria-is-in-theory-galactic-civilizations-but-looks-like-a-jackson-pollock-painting">the one that looks like an octopus murder scene</a> - and whadayaknow, by happy coincidence there's a public playtest running from right now till August 18th.

Going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2275300/view/517468855824548048">the Steam page</a> descriptions, you'll move your tent-dwelling tribe continually around a procedurally generated hexagonal map that consists of nine climates. Each climate has a different food web that is represented by an actual web, with a node for each predator and prey species. Ideally, you'll pick a mixture of food sources from that web so as to keep your cavepeople hale and hearty, without reducing the local ecosystem to dust.
</p>
<p>
While the hunter-gatherer premise obviously precludes construction elements, there <em>is</em> a research tree. You start off splitting flints, later gravitate to the mysteries of fire, and eventually clock domestication and the process of sowing and reaping. Alongside this, you'll flesh out your community's culture by picking between binary norms such as "pride" or "modesty" and "diligence" or "hedonism": these affect things like the odds of war with other groups of humans and how you approach trade.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the social simulation elements, which are represented as a tangled natto ball of coloured faces. "Manage the relationships between individuals, families, and tribes," explains the Steam page. "Watch your collective adapt over countless generations. Beware the unintended consequences current choices can have on your great-great-great-grandchildren." Mental note: try not to accidentally invent the patriarchy.

<p>
Lastly, there's combat, which sees you autobattling with charcoal cave paintings. You'll want to be wary of picking fights, because if Grarg the Forager takes a sharpened stone to the kisser, you'll not only lose her foraging skills but also all of the "hard-won wisdom" she might otherwise pass on to her kids. So the technologies and practices at your disposal are hereditary, then, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>? 
</p>
<p>
Other points of interest: the world periodically succumbs to an Ice Age, which obviously requires ingenuity and preparation to survive. You can join up with other roving communities to form bustling tribes of quarrelling factions. I'm going to sign up for that playtest and see how long it takes me to become an evolutionary dead end.

            <p>Oh, hello there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> The logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> with a name that's real awkward to stick midway through a sentence has surprise-released today, August 7th, right off the back of an appearance in a Nintendo Indie World showcase.</p>
<p>When we woke up this morning, all we knew was that this game about telling people where to stick their bottoms would be coming out in August - a vague window previously announced during June's Whole Direct. Now, it be here.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," devs Ausiàs Dalmau Roig and Sergi Pérez Crespo wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035120/view/545616987916599655?l=english">Steam post</a>. In doing so, making official the release they'd revealed with a fresh trailer in Nintyland. "Over the past two years, we have worked hard to bring you Is This Seat Taken? We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p>As you might have gleaned from the name, the game's all about pleasing little shape-people -  who each have different wants and demands - by seating them in the appropriate spots, with the infinite whims and limited chairs in each scene forming the challenges you'll bang your head against. Well, relatively. It looks pretty chill.</p>

<p>If you want a taste of what it offers before dropping your hard earned cash, the demo our Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-stress-free-logic-puzzles-of-is-this-seat-taken-make-for-my-favourite-demo-in-ages">played earlier this year</a> is still free to grab on Is This Seat Taken?'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">Steam page</a> as of writing.</p>
<p>"I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head," the Reuben wrote of his time with said demo, "The world's first Seatlike? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed."</p>
<p>So, there you go. It's like the video game version of a nun's robe that's secretly concealing a strap-on. Or maybe that's not quite what he meant there. You can see why when I ask Is This Seat Taken?, the answer's often a look of disdain, can't you?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-seat-taken-i-hope-not-because-the-sitting-themed-logic-puzzler-is-out-now]]></content:encoded>
