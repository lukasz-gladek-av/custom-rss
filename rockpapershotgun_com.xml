I fear and covet no videogame genre on this Earth like the bullet hell shoot 'em up. I find these scions of the arcades irresistibly beautiful. They look like how I imagine human nervous systems appear to thunder spirits. By the same token, I’m not sure they're actually designed to be processed by the human nervous system. They're the sort of game the androids will play, once they’ve hunted down and incinerated the last of our kind.

Within the shmup genre, the Touhou Project series stands as a diamond-hard constellation of electrochemical pizazz. Dating back to 1997, it spans 20 mainline games and 13 spin-offs, all created by Team Shanghai Alice, a studio that apparently consists of a single guy, Nagano, Japan-based Jun'ya Ōta. The series has spawned a vast cosmos of fanworks. Today sees the release of another fan game, Touhou Kouzougi ～ Flickerframe Shutter Festival from Brazilian game developer Ryann Thierry. 'Tengu paparazzo', you say? Seems worth a quick post. Here’s a trailer.

I’m writing about Flickerframe Shutter Festival partly because I really like that trailer soundtrack – the game's score is the work of Benji Tunez, and is apparently full of references to other Touhou productions – and partly, because this is my first exposure to the concept of a “photography bullet hell”. As in other shmups, the basic idea here is to survive on a screen that looks like a tornado full of stinging jellyfish. The twist is that rather than just shooting bullets back at the source of those projectiles, you’re trying for a Kodak moment. 
</p><p>
“Use your camera to take shots of the bosses, while also clearing the projectiles shot by them!” explains the blurb. “Acquire new skills given to you by your clients to aid you in your sessions! Try getting the craziest shots to overcome your highest scores!”
</p>
<p>
Photographing bosses to death – what a concept! I actually think I might be able to master this one, inasmuch as a lesser-known vidyagame gurnalist skill is taking screenshots during fights. For the professional hack, there is no shame greater than having to illustrate a breathless description of a nuclear haymaker with a picture of the protagonist looking at a table, or something. 
</p>
<p>
True, you can automate the taking of screengrabs nowadays, but I’ve always preferred the personal touch - and I’m sure that old school obstinacy will stand me in good stead as I try to beat Flickerframe Shutter Festival. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3829880/Touhou_Kouzougi__Flickerframe_Shutter_Festival/">Which you can find on Steam</a>.

            <p>
Not long before joining Rock Paper Shotgun, I wrote a feature for Edge magazine about the origins of the very silly term "AAA game". The overall conclusion I came to is that "AAA game" is possibly a boardroom-level borrowing from the credit rating industry and Hollywood, and that it has little meaning beyond "most expensive/biggest". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a bauble casually excreted by pinstriped cats wallowing in jacuzzis sometime in the mid-90s, for the benefit of the investor class. But in much the same way that any fleck of dust can become a pearl, or at least a larger clump of dust, so the term has attracted additional meanings and significance over the ensuing years, partly because game journalists like myself keep taking it seriously.</p>
<p>My interviewees talked about triple-A's association with the shift to polygonal 3D graphics, with certain genres such as the open world, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and with exclusive hiring practices that require "triple-A experience" and thus have an unavoidable bias, given that "triple-A" studios have often been staffed predominantly by people of a certain race, gender and background.
</p>
<p>
These more specific developments aside, triple-A has shed an A to produce the retrospectively beloved genre of "AA games", aka grainy noughties shooters with a gimmick, and also sprouted additional As. Concluding the Edge write-up, I touched briefly and humorously on Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/">coining of "AAAA game" </a>in a brazen attempt to mindfuck people complaining about the delayed release and pricing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>. 
</p><p>
As sure as the sparrows fly south for winter, another executive has now gazumped Guillemot. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">Ian Games</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/god-help-us-all-gta-6-may-be-a-aaaaa-game-says-devolver-co-founder-and-thats-why-the-entire-industry-is-taking-cover-from-it-like-its-a-nuclear-blast/">Percy Gamer</a> for spotting) about the dark art of competing with other publishers for release dates, Devolver co-founder Nigel Lowrie has described <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> as an "AAAAA game". Here's the complete sentence: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lowrie isn't the first to try this, admittedly. CD Projekt Red's investor relations VP Karolina Gnaś <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-nielubowicz-chief-financial-officer-i-karolina-gnas-vp-ds-relacji-inwestorskich-cd-projekt-sa-start-29-marca-o-godz-1100,704">has already been there and bought the T-shirt</a>. But Gnaś was poking fun at Ubisoft's "AAAA game" claim at the time, whereas Lowrie seems to be in earnest. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, he seems to think that "AAAA game" is everyday parlance now. I, for one, was not consulted about this, but I can see why The Industry might be in a hurry to leave AAAA behind. To my knowledge, the only card-carrying AAAA games besides the ailing Skull and Bones are Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the current record-holder for longest-serving vapourware, and Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, which was recently cancelled. If AAA means "most expensive/biggest", AAAA basically seems to mean "doomed".
</p><p>
The whole circus is worth following inasmuch as it's a crude illustration of the continuing drive to appease investors who are not content with the "maturation" of returns, and are always looking for the next Level Up. Still, I realise the advanced financial language may be confusing to ordinary humans, so I've put together this quick-and-dirty cheatsheet for both existing A-based videogame lifeforms and those likely to emerge the next time an executive joins an earnings call. Here you go:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
AAA - GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAA - Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAA - GTA 6
</p>
<p>
AAAAAA - GTA 6 on max settings
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6: Ultimate Whale's Edition with fully operational Quantum Field simulation and digital rights management supplied by orbital self-guided "Blundershut &amp; Custard" Clockwork Plasma Cannon array
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + gravitational implosion of known universe
</p>
<p>
A - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Gabe, and the Word was Gabe. The same was in the beginning with Gabe. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
<p>AA - [DESYNCHRONIZED]
</p>
<p>
AAA - GTA 3 again

</p></blockquote>
<p>PS. I've just noticed that Edge feature is on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/aaa-developers-discuss-the-three-little-letters-that-have-shaped-an-industry-its-a-stupid-term-its-meaningless/">Gamesradar</a> now, if you fancy a read.</p>
