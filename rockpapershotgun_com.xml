            <p>Ok, so if you're one of those high-vis types who can be driven up the wall by health and safety code violations, you might want to look away. Crashout Crew, a co-op chaos-generator all about forklifts, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> co-developers Aggro Crab, with sights set on a 2026 release preceded by a Steam demo this month.</p>
<p>I told you to look away, high-vis types! Why are you already running to management with a written demand that all heavy machinery can't be drifted around at top speed and slammed into boxes?</p>

<p>Anyway, forget about them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a> looks like a great laugh. You can up to four mates are strapped into forklifts that can boost and drift, with the mission of grabbing various good strewn around a warehouse, and pushing a big red button to jet them off on the right conveyor belts. Failure to do so results in quotas not being hit, and presumably a telling off. As you progress, you can add extra quirks or wrinkles to the action via safety violations, much like in real life.</p><p>"After the recent cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-under">Going Under</a> 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development," Aggro Crab wrote of how it came to be. "While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew!"</p>
<p>A full release in 2026 is being aimed for, but ahead of that Crashout Crew'll be getting a demo on October 13th, as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest. You'll be able to give the first three levels a go and see if the chaos offered is up to snuff.</p>
<p>Aggro Crab have also made clear that Peak, the co-opper based around going for hikes up big hills developed by themselves and Landfall Games, will still be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-wants-you-to-waste-your-time-on-silly-things-like-basketball-and-chess-in-its-latest-climbing-averse-update">getting updates</a>. The studio plan to dual wield goofy creations in their quest to ensure that every being on Earth must have at least one chuckle with their colleagues while playing a video game.</p>
<p>It's a noble cause, and also a formula that's yielded Peak a considerable amount of success so far. So, let's see if doubling down will rocket Aggro Crab's forklift to even greater heights.</p>
