            <p>Right, so, you've read the headline. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> mod that adds a rubbish chute to Megabuilding H10 with full animations and everything, so that you can exit V's default flat via a big slide down to ground level.</p>
<p>It's a totally unnecessary thing for someone to have spend time adding to a video game. It's a totally unnecessary thing for a person to download and add to a video game they've bought. It's also totally glorious, to the point that none of that other stuff matters a jot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's called (clears throat) <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22334?tab=description">"Weeee"</a>, and is the work of prolific Cyberpunk modder Phil 'Deceptious' Wright. If you've modded Cyberpunk at any point over the years, odds are you've given any number of their more advanced works a look, with these including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/11590">revamped romances</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7833">custom quests</a>, and a whole new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/18223">intro/backstory option</a>.</p>
<p>All of that stuff's really impressive, especially given that most of it relies on community-developed tools that modders have made to let them bend a game with notorious bug potential to their will without breaking it. At the same time, as a mod user, I get just as much of a kick out of seeing all that expertise turned on something that's just for a laugh.</p>

<p>Enter the trash slide. It's a very simple and goofy premise, but it's been put together like the Mona Lisa of gags. There's a full animation that plays just as seamlessly as any of the base game's every time you slide down from the atrium of the Megabuilding, and transitions into a satisfying thunk as you land in a pile of binbags. There's a ladder neatly tucked away to get you down to street level from there, so you aren't limited to jumping down and breaking your cyber ankles.</p>
<p>For a big yellow slide tacked to the side of a building, the chute's not so in-your-face as to take you out of the wider Cyberpunk experience. It's goofy in practice, but I could easily see myself incorporating it into the backstory of a quirky character who doesn't like lifts.</p>
<p>CD Projekt could add an exact copy of this to the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">their next patch</a> and you'd not feel like their standards had slipped one bit. I love jank in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">jokey modding antics</a> as much as anyone. It's often a huge part of the charm, knowing for sure that a human had a laugh making this because they've cocked it up a bit. However, there's something to be said for tomfoolery that's executed with the deft touch and elegance of the finest Shakespearian knob gag.</p>
<p>If you want to try the slide, you'll need to grab its requirements, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, because as I stressed, this is advanced modding at its finest.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, the troubled sequel to dino husbandry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, will "hopefully" launch into early access by 2027, according to Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz. The key question appears to be when to shift the focus away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, the original Ark's Unreal Engine 5 revamp, which launched in early access in 2023. Also, designing a Soulslike combat system is hard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">PCGamesN</a>, Stieglitz explained that Studio Wildcard had a vertical slice (loosely defined, a demo that shows off all aspects of the final game) for Ark 2 prior to Survival Ascended's launch. But the devs "felt that as a team, it would be very difficult to follow that all the way through to a complete game with both our experience level and [our scope] as a company". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz says the developers needed to get their heads around Unreal Engine 5 before taking a swing at Ark 2, and in particular, its new Soulslicorice combat system. "It's very difficult to do soulslike combat in a multiplayer PvP context," Stieglitz went on. "You could probably count the number of games on one hand that have even attempted that in an actual PvP context."
</p>
<p>(FromSofties may be in uproar over this last claim - in his defence, Stieglitz is presumably referring to games like Ark that allow dozens of players per public session. Still, by all means count up the alternatives and prove him wrong. I'd do it but I need both these hands to type with.)</p>
<p>
Right now, "a small portion" of Studio Wildcard are working to "refine" the mechanics of that old Ark 2 vertical slice. Stieglitz reckons it'll take "18 months of hardcore team focus to [turn] that vertical slice into an early access game, when we get to put the vast majority of our team back on it." He thinks Ark 2 will launch into early access "hopefully within the next two years", but it all depends on when Studio Wildcard decide to shift their efforts away from Survival Ascended.
</p>
<p>
Aside from dancing the Soulslike Fantastic with the new brontosaurus-punching mechanics, Studio Wildcard intend to feature proper NPC antagonists in Ark 2, "because that's been implied by the trailer and has been part of our design for quite some time as an opposing force, so to speak". 
</p>
<p>
Stieglitz wants to "add a lot more threat level to the environment and the feeling of being able to enjoy a PvP-like experience, even without [fighting against other players]." He's also gunning for a user-generated content system that works more "seamlessly under the hood while you're playing the game", rather than being presented as a menu.
</p>
<p>
Survival Evolved players may not be too tickled to hear of the present commitment to Survival Ascended. The Unreal Engine revamp launched in October 2023 with some new creatures and structures, but without much of Survival Evolved's expansion content. In the process, Giant Squid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-evolveds-official-servers-switch-off-in-just-a-few-hours-paving-the-way-for-remake">took the original game's servers offline</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As the developers have hitherto made plain, Ascended exists in large part to fund Ark 2's development, not just help them cut their teeth on a new engine or git gud at parrying. Initially, they were planning to launch it in a bundle with a $50 Ark 2 pre-order, but players swarmed the comms like testy oviraptors, and the developers ultimately released Ascended by itself for $45, before launch discounts. It now has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-survival-ascendeds-first-expansion-recruits-the-studio-behind-jujutsu-kaisen-for-some-flashy-anime-cutscenes">a DLC roadmap that runs till end of 2026</a>.
</p>
<p>
The bad blood continues to swirl. Steam user reviews for Ascended remain <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2399830/ARK_Survival_Ascended/#app_reviews_hash">mixed</a>, and the original Ark <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">has more players on Steam right now</a>, despite the loss of official server support. Still, I'm sure Studio Wildcard will keep plugging on with it, because after all, confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as...
