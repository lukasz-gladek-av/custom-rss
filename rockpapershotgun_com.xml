Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a>? That was a bloody lovely game. I'm always partial to a game where photography is the core mechanic, there's such a specific joy in navigating a space attempting to capture a fracture of its essence. Photo modes just aren't the same, I want someone to textually give me a camera and send me on my way. A sequel was announced last year, quite simply called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem-2">Toem 2</a>, and during yesterday's Day of the Devs, some gameplay was shown off for the first time.

Essentially, it looks like more of the same (which I want to quickly make clear is a wonderful thing), albeit clearly with a few more years of artistic experience under the developers' belts. Environments are fully 3D now, rather than what (I'm guessing) were all 2D textures mapped onto 3D objects. You're still out on an adventure, taking pictures along the way to uncover a phenomenon that is being kept hush, hush for the time being.

The sequel will feature special NPCs called Friends (aww), all of which have their own unique questline. Once you've wrapped up a quest, they'll give you a camera tool like, uh, scissors! Which cut things! As scissors are want to do. Or you'll get a hammer, no prize for guessing what that does. None of these things sound particularly camera related, but they look like fun ways to interact with the world. You can jump around and climb things now too, lots of ways to have some fun outside of taking a picture of a cheeky gnome.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for Toem 2 just yet, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/">here</a>!

If we're being honest with ourselves, the original PSP was a sort of Proto-Switch too, no? As in it was home to a lot of odd, smaller-scope games that not many other platforms might have featured outside of Nintendo's earlier handhelds. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/patapon">Patapon</a> was one such tiny oddity, one of the most charming games on the platform, if not to ever outright exist. It did go on to get a couple of sequels, but the series (outside of an upcoming remaster of the first two) is sort of dead. Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, a spiritual successor from Patapon's creator is here to satisfy your tiny-guy-chanting-to-music needs with a newly revealed release date!

Featured during yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation, it was revealed that the rhythm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action game (take a shot for every genre it mixes) will be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/">Steam in early access</a> next month on July 25th. I'm quite excited by this one personally, those little chants in the original Patapon are burnt into my ear canals, I'm looking forward to getting something fresh in there that I can also repeat to myself ad infinitum. Yes that sounds like someone's personal hell, I just love a good chant.

Luckily, none of us actually have to wait to check it out either. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo</a> you can give a punt right now, something I'll be trying to fit in amongst the 1000 showcases taking place this week. The one thing I'm uncertain of is the roguelike element - outside of that it just looks like an incredibly lush and colourful, modern take on an old classic. Whether that roguelike quality will rob itself of tightly designed levels is something I'll have to find out for myself.
</p>
<p>
Ratatan also differs slightly in that you can freely move the little guys around, adding an extra tactical layer to it all. I will cry if even one of the Ratatans die, so, I'll be working hard to make the right choices.
