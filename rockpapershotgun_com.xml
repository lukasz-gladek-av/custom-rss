            <p>BioWare’s misbegotten mech-me-do Anthem died this week after EA pulled the official servers. It’s a sad day for people who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">saw promise in the game’s sci-fi world and flight mechanics</a>, however spoiled by the always-online looter-shooting, and a happy day for people who really hated being called “freelancer” in community bulletins. I was an actual freelancer when Anthem came out in 2019, and I didn’t get no mech suit. At least when the Destiny developers call you a Guardian, it feels sort of romantic, rather than like rubbing your nose in your own economic precarity. </p>
<p>Anyway, ‘officially unsupported’ doesn’t necessarily mean ‘gone for good’. In one of his many tell-all videos, former Anthem executive producer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> kingpin Mark Darrah has outlined a plan for bringing Anthem back as a single-player RPG, with a “conservative” budget of $10 million.</p><!--more-->
<p>Darrah makes his case for an Anthem re-release at the end of a gigantic new video "The Truth About What Happened on Anthem", as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">Eurogamer</a>. The first step, he says, would be to update the game for current gen consoles, introduce the latest graphics features and lock it to 60 frames a second. “You're going to spend some engineering probably making that be pretty solid,” Darrah explains. “But it's not too difficult because you're getting there to a large degree by throwing better hardware at it.”</p>
<p>Hmm! I feel like I need a third-party programmer’s opinion on this. I’m not used to seeing the words “not too difficult” in connection to updating games to run on new hardware. Then again, I didn't preside over the development of a bunch of Mass Effect and Dragon Age games, so what do I know.</p>

<p>“Two, and this is a big one, you move to locally hosted servers,” Darrah goes on. “Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months before launch. I don't know that they still work, but they the code is there to be salvaged and recovered.” Local server support would, of course, eliminate the publisher expense of keeping the game online. Presumably, the game's operating costs would need to rely on player donations, as with the formerly NCSoft-run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/city-of-heroes-community-run-private-server-gets-official-license-from-ncsoft">City Of Heroes</a>.</p>
<p>The lion’s share of the work in Darrah’s proposal consists of “[pivoting] to something that’s more about single player storytelling”, once you’ve got Anthem running on local servers.</p>
<p>“This is a game where the combat is designed around a group of four people,” he acknowledges. “So where most of your $10 million needs to go is in the creation of AI party members. And since this is BioWare, go all the way and make them companions. There are some existing characters that you could potentially promote into companions, but I think you're you would find that there is actually a lower friction route by making three to five new characters with dialogue, with plot arcs that are brand new to the series that are people who would go with you through the existing story of Anthem, as well as their companion content. </p><p>“You could go as low as three,” Darrah continues. “That's basically just enough to fill out your party. By going beyond three, you're able to have stronger personalities and people can potentially like or dislike them. Or if you want to tie the characters to specific Javelin styles or combat styles, it allows you to go into that as well.” I have to confess, I don’t quite follow Darrah here – surely if you have more characters, those personalities will get fewer resources apiece, and be less memorable?</p>
<p>“Writing those characters, not very difficult,” the elder BioWayfarer asserts. “Making the characters be able to move with you, that's where a lot of your work is going to have to go. You are essentially going to have to figure out how an AI-controlled Javelin pilot can stick with you out in the world. There are lots of Creepy Watson style tricks and cheats that you can use to make it easier, but a big amount of your work is going to have to go into the design of making those characters stay with you out in the world, making them be able to fight in a meaningful and useful way.”</p>
<p>Quick round of applause here for the drive-by mention of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWQk8zmpOs">Creepy Watson</a>, who is very much my favourite point of overlap between Sherlock and Slender Man.</p>
<p>Darrah feels that if you can accomplish all this, “what you've essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent, BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single player game.” He observes with 100% correctness that this would appeal to the many who didn’t play Anthem because they hate multiplayer looting and shooting. But he cautions that you “probably” wouldn’t be able to sell it for the current triple-A price of $70 a pop, and even then, he can’t see such a game selling “five, six, seven million copies”.</p><p>Needless to say, Darrah doesn’t expect EA to be keen, commenting that his plan “is very antithetical to what was being investigated in terms of fixing Anthem in the past”. The reference here is to Anthem Next, EA’s abortive attempt at a live service reboot. </p>
<p>Darrah washes all this down with some thoughts on game preservation at large. “We're entering into a period where we have disappeared media - media that becomes unavailable through direct intentional actions by the rights holder,” he says, drawing parallels with Disney’s now-unavailable Willow TV series and DC’s reportedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batgirl_(film)">near-complete, yet unreleased Batgirl movie</a>. </p>
<p>“Should companies be required to make their games playable indefinitely?” Darrah muses. “I think there's a conversation to be had there. The things that would have been required to make Anthem playable in its entirety from the beginning back in 2019 were are substantial and they would have compromised parts of the game. But you can imagine different forms of a playable Anthem. Like we just discussed, there is a possible path to a singleplayer version of Anthem that doesn't require dedicated servers. So maybe there's a version of legislation that could be imagined that keeps games playable in some state beyond their intended lifespan.”</p>
<p>Darrah throws in a shout-out to Stop Killing Games, the consumer movement to introduce laws requiring publishers not to render games unplayable by taking their servers offline. “Their goals are a little bit more ambitious than simply having a conversation,” he notes. “But at least now the conversation is actually happening.” </p><p>SKG are certainly making headlines. Recently, a handful of UK Green Party members <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-green-party-mps-would-be-compelled-to-support-stop-killing-games-if-a-proposed-policy-amendment-passes">proposed an amendment</a> to make support for the group's objectives official policy. The SKG petition has also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">debated in Parliament</a>, with one Labour MP arguing that "the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>

            <p>Let the runes of protection blaze upon the vestments of the machine spirit; let psalm pervade circuitry and obliterate the Enemy’s designs; let fire and catechism fall upon the creeping ruin of Abominable Intelligence. Brothers! The hour of motion is at hand. Games Workshop have banned their employees from using generative AI tools to create or design Warhammer stuff, because their senior management don’t consider the technology very “exciting”. Their CEO also seems irked about software companies shoving generative AI into every new device or system update, whether it’s desired or not. The tech-priests are coming for your candy ass, ChatGPT!</p>
<p>That said, they don’t appear to be prohibiting the usage of generative AI by partners, including game developers, and they will allow senior staff “to continue to be inquisitive about the technology”, which I am tempted to read as a sop to investors driven stir-crazy by NVIDIA’s share price. Omnissiah be… somewhat enthused? Relatively undisappointed?</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Games Workshop’s stance reflects concerns about the company’s art being appropriated and used for generative AI ‘training’. I’m sure they’re also worried about a backlash from Warhammer’s massive community of miniature painters and other external creatives (recently, poster marketplace Displate <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">got it in the neck</a> over AI "red flags" in a Warhammer 40,000 artwork). Speaking during the company’s <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/7lRczzQBbvA22PEmSVJN8K/2de2f722e20e1d69b9aa3ed4e1b95678/2025-26_half_year_report_v3.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a> yesterday, Games Workshop chief executive Kevin Rountree shared the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>A very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it. We do have a few senior managers that are: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not. </p>
<p>We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio - hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, all this seemingly just applies to Games Workshop itself, for the moment, but it’s sure to have ripple effects among Warhammer videogame developers such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a> studio Owlcat, who revealed back in 2024 that they were <a href="https://x.com/OwlcatGames/status/1763946679470788722?s=20">using generative AI</a> "for additional work with concepts and speeding up some internal processes". Games Workshop are historically pretty zealous about how their designs and setting are recreated by third parties.</p><p>While there are plenty of generative AI evangelists on the shop, including a few big cheeses at EA, Ubisoft and most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-director-goes-all-in-on-ai-as-south-koreas-games-industry-looks-to-compete-on-the-global-stage">Stellar Blade developers Shift-Up</a>, there is also a mounting tide of resistance to generative AI adoption. Recently, Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">cancelled a whole game</a> over suspicions of generative AI usage in a trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse have banned generative AI art from their games, and Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">partly walked back</a> their own implementations of the tech in the forthcoming Divinity.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you've laid hands on the plastic contours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, you’ve probably seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a> in action: badges of honour (or of 'Unsupported' disgrace) on a game’s Steam store page, reflecting how well it runs and plays on the portable PC per Valve’s in-house testing. The programme is being expanded to include the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> too, and is set to bestow a lot more games with Steam Machine Verified status, given what a Valve designer calls "fewer restraints" in their judging criteria.</p>
<p>Lawrence Yang – who’s worked on the new Machine, the Deck, and the also-incoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> – told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game Developer</a> that it’ll be easier for a game to achieve a coveted green checkmark sticker with its SteamOS mini-PC, and that Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" for its new verification checks as the Steam Deck’s. Even if, especially in the case of the Frame VR headset, different requisites will apply. This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-own-any-steam-deck-verified-games-then-youve-already-got-a-guarantee-theyll-work-on-the-steam-machine">follows a Valve blog post</a> that put things in simpler terms: if a game is Steam Deck Verified, it'll be Steam Machine Verified too.</p>
<p>Rather than a lowering of standards, for the Steam Machine specifically, it’s pretty obvious that “lifting constraints” simply reflects differences in the hardware’s power and use cases versus the handheld Steam Deck. Yang didn’t specify details, but it’s easy to guess which criteria from the Deck Verified programme weren't as urgently applicable: for instance, some only score a 'Playable' badge instead of full Verified status because they include small text that’s harder to read on the 7in, 800p screen. The Steam Machine intends to hook up to TVs and desktop monitors, so that’s probably not worth including in the new device’s rulebook.</p>

<p>Considering the shared use of SteamOS, other touchstones will definitely remain, like whether a game can display the correct gamepad button glyphs (Valve would very much like you to play the Steam Machine with their revamped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>) or whether it needs occasional keyboard input. Valve will be testing for performance too, though since the Steam Machine is significantly beefier in the graphical muscles than the Deck, it’d naturally win more Playable and Verified statuses here anyway.</p><p>This is all good news for players and developers alike – the former get more at-a-glance transparency on which games in their library will work, and the latter (as Game Developer points out) a handy marketing tool. It’s a shame, then, that the Steam Deck itself has become mired in uncertainty since its reveal late last year, the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component shortages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">price rises</a> raising questions around the Gabecube’s affordability and lack of a concrete release date beyond "early 2026".</p>

            <p>A first round of hotfixes has arrived for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, following the Minecrafty sandboxer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-out-now-and-its-devs-are-advising-those-suffering-download-issues-or-errors-to-keep-plugging-away">arrival in early access</a> form yesterday. Developers Hypixel have also offered some insight into which aspects of it they're planning to prioritise working on in the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving right into <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">the note</a>s for this initial round of hotfixing, you'll naturally find a number of the "most critical" initial teething issues folks reported running into upon firing the game up for the first time. For example, you'll now get a warning if your computer's time is out of date, since this had caused some "authentication issues", with the launcher login process as a whole hopefully now less likely to serve you such errors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to setting up servers, Hypixel have added a message letting you know whether authentication is required after your server boots up and made sure you'll be automatically switched into offline mode if your online session runs into a hiccup which invalidates it. A number of crash causes have also been ironed out, including some caused by simply using buckets - that fix will require you to destroy and replace any workbenches which now aren't working as intended. Picking certain hair styles before doing your eyebrows in the character creator is another of these potential returners-to-desktop which have been dealt with.</p>
<p>Alongside delivering this round of initial fixes, as part of <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a longer post</a> celebrating Hytale's early access launch, Hypixel have offered a bit of insight into what you can expect them to be doing in the near future:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the first few months, we intend to deliver updates quickly and frequently, as there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites we need to tackle before we can move into larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences. The work on the official minigames will begin in the coming months, enabling us to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, we already have prototypes of social features, such as friend lists and proximity voice chat, in development. Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time!</p></blockquote>
