            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now. Our Borderlands 4 review is not, because we have only just been sent a review code. I fear I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">unduly forgiving of Team Cherry</a> last week for not supplying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> code before release - they're a cute, tiny indie, after all, albeit a cute, tiny indie with the power to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-has-murdered-steam">break Steam</a> - so let's take a firmer stance this time: bad! Wrong! Don't you know you're suffocating games journalism, Gearbox and 2K Games, you swaggering chancers? Whither accountability and transparency in a time of choosy PR departments? 
</p>
<p>I should teach you all a lesson by diverting your brand power and googlejuice towards some other game instead. I think I will, actually. What else is on sale today. Ah yes, Try To Drive.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Try To Drive (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621700/Try_To_Drive/">Steam page</a>) is one of those daft multiplayer games that trades on co-op partners repeatedly sabotaging each other. In this case, it's a tandem simulator, a tandem being a bicycle for two people.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Red Core Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Doesn't sound nearly as arduous upfront as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">climbing out of hell</a> while shackled to Nic "We Can Jump Those Lasers" Reuben and Brendan "My Left Not Your Left" Caldwell, but you will not be cycling down any ordinary roads in Try To Drive. You will be cycling along chains of floating biscuits pooped out by gingerbread men. You will be ponderously T-bogging your way over precarious glass accordions.
</p><p>I actually have some firsthand expertise to bring to bear, here, based on sharing a tandem with my life partner. The trick is to put the one with the biggest bum in front. No, I am not going to tell you whether I have a bigger bum than my partner - don't be uncouth. My other top tip is to put a mirror on your handlebar so you can check whether the other rider is goofing off.
</p>
<p>I have run out of tandem expertise to share, so let's circle grudgingly back to Borderlands 4, the game that murdered journalism. My big takeaway from the previewage so far is that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-wont-be-making-jokes-every-minute-because-its-set-in-a-totalitarian-world">won't be as jokey as the other Borderlands games</a>, apparently because it's set in a totalitarian world, and they want to set a grimmer tone. 
</p>
<p>As some of you noted at the time of that linked report, the idea that humour isn't seemly in this context seems absurd, given that past Borderlands games have already seen us battling against odious corporate bosses and tyrants, while rattling through gags like ammo belts. That said, I do think Borderlands in general could benefit from being less punchline-driven.
</p>
<p>Beyond that, I can tell you only that they want <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-cutting-the-gags-borderlands-4s-pc-specs-say-it-still-needs-100gb-of-ssd-space">100GB</a> of SSD space for the pleasure, and they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">pondering an $80 price tag</a> at one point. If you're hungry for more, I will grit my teeth and suggest that you cast your eye over <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">this review from Very Gary Computing</a>. They <em>did</em> get code, possibly because they didn't call the studio boss an idiot in any of their news coverage.
</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Patch 2.31 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac and Nintendo Switch 2!</p><p>This update includes an AutoDrive upgrade and Photo Mode adjustments. It also addresses common issues encountered by players. For details, check the full list of… <a href="https://t.co/Jdpx1DI4V5">pic.twitter.com/Jdpx1DI4V5</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1966081108199809196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>
