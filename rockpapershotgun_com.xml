One of my favourite anime shows is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlrPO6dBaxw">Sakura Quest</a>. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

Hoshino needs to persuade 100 residents to attend the festival by gathering clues about their "quirks and desires". Some of these clues are found online, care of a gorgeous Y2K web browser that harbours a few minigames. Others must be uncovered using Hoshino's low-key Sherlockian capabilities. "A tossed-aside cigarette butt tells a story, and the fragrant scent of trees hides the sneaky presence of a mosquito," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107530/Danchi_Days/">the Steam page comments</a>. Confound you, trees! When the day of the festival comes, we will chop you down for firewood. Providing we get permission from the council.
</p><p>
Danchi Days takes inspiration from auld Japanese console delights like Earthbound and Moon Remix RPG, but it's also semi-autobiographical - based on developers sandy powder and Melos Han-Tani's experience of living in a real-life danchi, with art from illustrator mogumu. It's being published by Analgesic Productions, whose other works include the amazing and perpetually overlooked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> games. I'm hoping the new game's apartment block doesn't harbour anything like Anodyne 2's desertNPC.

Keen? It's not out for a while - sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch up on Sakura Quest. Don't miss the multiple episode arc about the fight to extend the local bus route.
