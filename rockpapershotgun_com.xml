</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> publishers Hooded Horse are imposing a strict ban on generative AI assets in their games, with company co-founder Tim Bender describing it as an “ethics issue” and “a very frustrating thing to have to worry about”. </p>
<p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways… suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku</a> in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'” I assume that's not a verbatim quote, but I'd love to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>The publishers also take a dim view of using generative AI for “placeholder” work, or indeed any ‘non-final’ aspect of game development. “We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender went on. </p>
<p>“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.” As an example of this slipping-through, see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">the accidental presence of a generated placeholder in The Alters</a>.

</p><p>Hooded Horse employ two artists for marketing, and Bender feels “it would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this.”</p><p>As with much discussion of generative AI, the difficulty of Hooded Horse’s position is pinning down what they're trying to ban. Does an artwork count as generated if somebody used the tech to make a base image of some kind, then fleshed it out and finished it off at length by hand? In general, genAI has become pervasive and hard to quantify across the divisions of game development, thanks not least to the deliberately imprecise, all-enveloping language of the companies selling it. There’s the gloomy underlying reality that a lot of genAI tools are being forced into operating systems and search engines in order to artificially boost “uptake” - it's hard <em>not</em> to use genAI, at this stage. </p>
<p>I write all this not to suggest that bans are useless, but that they need to be more detailed and specific. In general, whether they favour the tech or not, companies need to start talking in-depth about their usages of generative AI. As a small and slightly weird example from the world of education, James Allen’s Girls School in South London recently unveiled an <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/jamesallensgirlsschool/jags-ai-charter-and-curriculum">AI charter</a>, stipulating what they consider fair game both for teachers and for pupils.</p>
<p>I’d love to see similar documents from publishers, though I’m not expecting miracles in a world where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">the largest PC storefront’s approach to generative AI disclosures is practically useless</a>. But still, perhaps Larian will surprise me at their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">imminent Q&amp;A about generative AI usage in the forthcoming Divinity</a>.</p>
<p>Bender acknowledged the trickiness of policing generative AI when working with external partners, while reiterating the need for a blunt ban. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p><p>As an example of the difficulty of policing generative AI usage by third parties, consider the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">AI-generated material in trailers for Postal: Bullet Paradise</a>, which has now been cancelled - developers Goonswarm have attributed this oversight to external artists.</p>
<p>The minutiae of different genAI applications aside, the broad cultural or political case against generative AI has, IMO, remained pretty consistent (yes, this is the point in the 'news post' where I deliver the customary lecture, please skip to the comments if you are weary of such things). The biggest bots operate by parasitically appropriating and undermining the work of theoretically any and all human workers, whether or not you define this as actual theft or copyright infringement. Their actual utility beyond the grand promises is broadly unproven, and in some cases, obviously non-existent.</p>
<p>Being companies, the companies pushing them aren’t following the public interest: they are helping to drive up energy usage and emissions, and saturating daily life with “companion” technologies that may distort online discourse and in some cases, contribute to mental illness. Within the games industry, the tech is viewed by many executives and shareholders as a quick fix for unsatisfactory profit margins, and a tacit excuse for cutting staff.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make every usage of generative AI abominable – I can understand the appeal for smaller devs with minimal resources, and I am myself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">interested in art that makes genuinely imaginative and substantial use of generators of all kinds</a>, rather than just calling on them to “enhance productivity” - providing those technologies are responsibly operated.</p>
<p>But generative AI needs to be understood as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a form of class war</a> that will principally benefit the already-filthy-rich, and which is fundamentally anti-social in encouraging greater reliance on profit-driven corporate tools rather than solidarity with coworkers and peers.</p>
<p>Lecture over! For a more open-ended and nuanced discussion of generative AI in games, here's Sam Horti's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horrible-boring-and-cheap-experts-pan-new-chatbot-npcs-but-some-leave-room-for-optimism">recent excellent catch-up</a> with a brace of developers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and Thirsty Suitors writer Meghna Jayanth and Failbetter's narrative director Chris Gardiner.</p>

            <p>The regular modpocalypses which tend to erupt when a fresh update for a game comes down the pipeline - an especially terrifying prospect if it's an older game and the tweaks/additions aren't something you're happy to temporarily switch back to vanilladom in order to enjoy - may now be less of a ballache. Well, at least when it comes to the Steam Workshop, which has just had new version control pipes welded to its pulsating metal frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Building on the features they already has in terms of letting developers offer older versions of games as optional branches if they wish, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497183817277113901?utm_source=SteamDB">have announced</a> the release of some new Steam APIs and Workshop item options designed to "make it easier for developers and mod authors to work together in ensuring compatibility of mods as games evolve". Basically, devs are able to "better define" previous game versions , while modders can upload different versions of their mods which are compatible with those game versions and make clear what should work with what.</p>
<p>It's a process we've seen be necessary on a larger scale with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-modders-still-have-no-plans-to-port-it-to-next-gen-fallout-4-unless-a-console-version-becomes-possible">only available in a form</a> which works with a specific pre next-gen update version of that game. In this case, it should be easier to keep the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> working with your regular load order if you've delved into the workshop and downloaded 25 million custom livery mods for your favourite MAN lorry which are suddenly out of date. Though, obviously that still depends on developers and modders having gone in and made use of these new tools for their works.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/itemversioning">full documention</a>, devs will be able use Steam's API to detect which version of the game a player's using, which mods they have installed, and put up an interface splash asking the player if they'd like to switch to the right game version if necessary. That sounds like it could make troubleshooting much more of a doddle, with an extra step even suggesting Steam can subsequently be prompted to close the game, switch branches and relaunch the game once the right version's installed. As for a more in-depth picture of what you'll see when checking out which mods work with different versions, the following passage from the guidance for modders sheds a bit more light on how they might use the tools:</p>
<blockquote>We know that many mod authors will not have the time to check whether their mod supports the latest version of a game. So we built this system to support ranges that include or exclude future updates. If the mod item is generally a simple item and likely to work with new versions of the game, then it may make sense to leave the supported range open-ended. However, if the mod is complex and the mod author wishes to test their mod with new game versions before declaring support, that can be easily done when configuring the supported ranges.</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how it plays out in practice, but anything that might help keep us all from the scourge of corrupted or unusable saves with thousands of hours put into them is welcome news.</p>
