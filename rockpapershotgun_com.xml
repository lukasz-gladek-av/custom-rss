If a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell</a> remake fell in the woods, would over the top industry secrecy and NDAs even allow us to hear it? That's the million dollar question literally no one is asking, because who phrases things that way, but enough about that game that may or may not exist at this point in time, we've got a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> to talk about: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-blacklist">Blacklist</a>. Yes, the, technically speaking, most recent entry in the series just received a little update on Steam yesterday which… <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/235600/view/519711795144819220">adds achievements into the game</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As a reminder, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 12 year old game that did in fact release on other platforms, where it also had achievements, so why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have decided to add them in now all this time later is anyone's guess. Seriously, I'm sure this is something that at least one person wants, it's just such an odd thing to do.
</p>
<p>
There is a slight caveat to the announcement that mostly depends on how much you like achievement hunting. Ubisoft explains that "achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game." That means if you've already played the game on PC you'll have up to 28 achievements already achieved, for lack of a better word. Oh, and don't worry, all 19 online achievements that you needed online services for haven't been added in, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-give-online-services-for-older-games-a-stay-of-execution">those services aren't actually offered any more</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate that a game this old has received a little update like this, but you can't help but wonder what's going on with that remake. The last real update for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">back in 2022</a>, where some concept art was shown off. Since then… not much else has materialised. It's no secret that Ubisoft have been struggling for a while, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Tencent having to give them a whole lot of money recently</a> to keep things running. Maybe with some cash coming in, the time for the remake is almost upon us.

We have all ridden the emotional rollercoaster of thinking that we're smart and patient enough to play a dedicated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, then realising that we're inept and bored and just want to bonk things with a big axe. Still, I'm moderately enthused by this here release date trailer for The Siege And The Sandfox, a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> in which you clamber steadily out of a huge, opulent dungeon.</p>
<p>It launches on 20th May, and puts me in mind of Prince Of Persia, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Vagante and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. Obligatory but sincere Google-baiting intro comparisons: done. Tray-tray, away!

You are the Sandfox, obviously - a "notorious assassin" and royal protector - and that's your own desert city that's under Siege. As the game begins, the Sandfox catches the city's Queen murdering the King. She promptly throws him into a big hole. Left for dead, you must journey upward through a realm of caves, mausoleums and decrepit yet majestic architecture, making a few friends and avoiding quite a lot of guards and area-specific ne'er-do-wells with distinct capabilities. The aesthetic isn't startling but it is enveloping: a generous, greasy cut of 16-bit orientalism, with lots of baroque backdrops and light seeping through the pixels.
</p>
<p>
You will make use of parkour techniques such as pole-swinging, together with devious, underhand gambits such as politely closing doors behind you. Along the way you will encounter an ancient evil. Something tells me that the ancient evil will ultimately prove more important than getting vengeance on the Queen. Wouldn't be surprised if the Queen was the goodie, actually. Wouldn't be surprised if she butchered the King to keep said ancient evil in check somehow. But enough of my soothsaying.

Developers <a href="https://cardboardsword.co.uk/">Cardboard Sword</a> are "an AAA-experienced multi-talented team with over 160 years of combined experience". I hate self-promotion that weirdly slops together the lifeforce of team members. I'm spitefully picturing one stooped and spindly programmer with a long white beard, surrounded by a crowd of shrieking eight-year-old designers and artists. Their other games include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/509950/Transmission/">Transmission</a>, which is "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> on a rainy summer night in 1986".
