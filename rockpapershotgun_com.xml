            <p>He's back. Tim Cain, co-creator of the original Interplay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallouts</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</a> programmer has emerged from semi-retirement, returning to Obsidian to work on a game he can't talk about yet because legal documents. For the past few years, the veteran developer's been contracting on a number of games, including Obsidian's own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, having previously co-directed the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds">Outer Worlds</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>"I’m back at Obsidian," Cain announced in the latest video posted to his YouTube channel where he talks about many things. "I’m there as a full-time employee and in-person, so not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore. So, this means that I’m not working at other places, although there’s at least one game that I worked on [in that capacity for another studio] that I know is going to ship."</p>
<p>Sensing the speculation swarm buzzing at his door, Cain swiftly said: "I can’t talk about the project that I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered by NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not going to guess right. I would say that I’m probably a lot less retired now." Damn you, No Don't Ask paperwork.</p>
<p>Despite having a new gig, the veteran developer doesn't currently have any plans to stop posting to his YouTube channel, which he started to discuss stories from his career after being told a written memoir he penned was a bit boring.</p><p>"No one in Obsidian has even remotely suggested that I have to stop it," Cain explained. "In fact, many of my co-workers have said that they watch this channel. And I know they did because they started telling me which videos were their favorite or what stories I said that they thought were funny. So, people are saying that they like it. I'm going to keep doing it as long as I have stories to tell. As long as you have questions that are really good and that I think need a video to answer and that I can answer."</p>
<p>Good news, especially given a section of this particular video includes a clip of Cain feeding a squirrel a walnut, which he says is basically a tax he now has to pay whenever he leaves the place he's recently moved into.</p>
<p>Now, we just have to wait and see what this mystery game the studio who put out both The Outer Worlds 2 and its quirky mushroom sibling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> this year have brought the original Falloutman back for.</p>
