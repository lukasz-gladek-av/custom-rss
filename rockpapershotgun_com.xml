            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 1 is about to begin, adding the Fantastic Four to the free-to-play hero shooter’s roster so that they can beat up Dracula, who has swamped the Earth in eternal night. It launches January 10th at 1 am PT / 4 am ET / 9 am GMT, and developers NetEase are paving the way in the traditional manner by rebalancing the character line-up so as to simultaneously win the adoration of certain player groups, while plunging others into apoplectic fury.</p>
<p>Do you like running rampage as Hela, goddess of death? Was that <em>you</em> who shot me full of crows on Klyntar last night? Well, how does 25 points off your base health suit you? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Screw you too.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hela is one of many who’ve succumbed to the nerf. NetEase’s Thanos-style fingersnap has also made the Incredible Hulk less incredible: according to the full patch notes, it drops the Indestructible Guard gamma shield value for Hero Hulk from 250 to 200. Somewhat counter-intuitively, HawkEye has undergone a rework to make him less effective with a bow - “decreasing the medium-long range damage capability, reducing the threatening combat radius, and slightly improving the close combat resistance for the avenging archer”.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>’s survivability has also been cut: the patch reduces “the additional health provided to self after refreshing Vibranium Marks with Spirit Rend from 40 to 30, and the upper limit of additional health provided from 120 to 75.”</p>
<p>For every loser there is at least one winner, naturally. Black Widow “was very much in need of optimization when evaluating the release experience of her abilities as well as a slightly increase to the threat of her ultimate ability.” Her Edge Dancer, Fleet Foot and Electro-Plasma Explosion abilities have all been juiced up.</p><p>In other news, Sea king Namor is better at throwing eggs, and Squirrel Girl’s Squirrel Tsunami has undergone a sinister evolution. The tsunami’s component squirrels will now “rush towards the nearest enemy after bouncing instead of bouncing randomly”, though the tsunami’s overall health has been halved. No longer shall the laws of chance save you from being set upon by berserking nutcrackers. These are dreadful times indeed. </p>
<p>You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">here</a>. Again, all this is a warm-up for Season 1, which introduces noble stretchyman Mr Fantastic, see-through lady Invisible Woman, prancing fireboy Human Torch, and grouchy rockdude The Thing. They’ll arrive as part of a season storyline in which Dr Doom and Dracula have conspired to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjdMYyjnmks">switch off the sun</a>, Mr Burns presumably being unavailable for recruitment at the time. Leaks further suggest that robonemesis Ultron is on the way to the line-up too.</p>
<p>Here’s a press release rundown:</p>
<blockquote><p>Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon’s orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures. With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals! </p></blockquote>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to steam up Steam, ranking at 6th most played at the time of this article's publication. Our Ed Thorn was ambivalent in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">his season 0 launch review</a>, summarising it as “like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, if Overwatch was overcomplex and frequented Comic Con”. He found much to like about the abilities and presentation, but argued that the spread of somewhat interchangeable hero designs transformed matches into “slightly formless blenders”. Are you still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the Christmas break, I took a brief hiatus from reporting on every time a Total War developer breathes or spills tea on their shirt. The year ended, the world did not, and no Thanquol DLC was announced, but I did miss what I reckon is the strongest hint they’ve yet freely given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 is both real and due an announcement very soon.

<p>(I want to use the phrase "here’s the skinny" more. I also want one of those little hats with the band for the card that says ‘press’ on it. These aren’t the same as ‘pressman’s hats’, which were made out of folded newspaper to protect print workers from detritus. <a href="https://deafprinters.com/files/fullsize/8f474c90d0294a96c4c9eb1efb1f11ee.jpg">Here’s some instructions on how to make one</a>. I wonder what the online media equivalent is? Tinfoil lined with redundancy letters, probably. Speaking of tinfoil…)</p>
<blockquote><p>If a future Total War game, thematically, requires blood then we will include it within the base game without the need for a separate purchase. This might mean an increase in our age ratings for future titles and how we potentially market our games, but we want the franchise to be as thrilling, immersive and authentic as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>For context, Total War games have long shipped without blood effects, dismemberment, and other such violences, instead selling optional DLC ‘blood packs’ for a few pounds or dollars. The company line on this has always been that it’s to ensure a lower age rating, although much of the community has maintained it’s a case of squeezing out some extra revenue. Personally, I’ve always been torn. Extra animation work is naturally development work, but the line between what development work counts as ‘extra’ enough to merit charging separately seems mainly a matter of good faith: a case of ‘we’ll know where the line is when someone crosses it’.</p><p>Anyway, the blog statement feels to me about as close as you can get to saying “We’re making 40k” without actually saying it, although I understand how that might sound spurious if you don’t follow the company closely. The first thing I’d point to is that if CA have made the decision to potentially lose customers or otherwise limit sales by accepting a higher age rating, then they’ve likely got a game on their hands they’re confident will sell gangbusters regardless. Between the comparatively mainstream success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Henry Cavill’s 40k project with Amazon</a>, 40k currently feels like a safer, more culturally relevant bet, more so than even Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars - settings largely coasting on nostalgia rather than recent successes, outliers like Andor aside.</p>
<p>To me, CA dangling the prospect of bloodier Total War games that are marketed to an older audience is about as close as you can get to saying "We’re making 40k" without actually saying it. Historical Total Wars can reasonably exist in a sort of sterile quasi-documentary framing, suitable for hogging good, Christian CPUs and basing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Commanders">old British game shows</a> around. But the idea of a game <em>thematically requiring</em> blood feels like a strong hint. It doesn’t rule out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">Total Star Wars</a> as the next fantasy offering, but I don’t think it's referring to Star Wars either, a setting largely able to get by on laser burns and characters dramatically falling off things. Lord Of The Rings gets by on characters dramatically climbing up things, and also needs a good dose of gore if they go with Peter Jackson’s lingering splatter tendencies. But I’d say the only setting that is both a likely contender for an entry at all, and absolutely requires gore to even be recognisable, is 40k.</p>
<p>Not that the blog would be enough to go on in isolation, but it does feel significant in the context of CA’s increasingly collaborative relationship with Games Workshop. The Khorne section of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC marked the first appearance of units from Warhammer Fantasy’s End Times period in the series, but even as far back as the the Vampire Coast DLC, we got an original character - not to mention Kislev and Grand Cathay. I think it’s fair to say that GW view CA’s work as not just an interpretation of their own worlds, but an extension, and that they'd trust this developer with the keys to the 41st Millennium - not that they've been incredibly picky in the past.</p>
<p>Also, Total Warhammer 40k will make all the money in the world. I’m not a business analyst but I did get out a tenner from the cash machine several months ago for emergencies and it’s still in my wallet, so I think I know a thing or two about finance. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyenas">Hyenas</a>, I reckon Creative Assembly would quite like all the money in the world.</p><p>So that’s the making of the thing, how about the timeline? Well, it does sound like we’ll see a couple of bigger announcements this year. "We hope to unveil some new projects too - we’ll share more when we’re ready at the tail-end of next year," reads the blog.</p>
<p>So, there’s my reasoning, pick it apart at your leisure. Elsewhere in the blog, vice president of Total War (banger title) Roger Collum also announces that Shadows Of Change will be getting divided into three parts to match the subsequent expansions, and that Total War will be ditching the launcher. This last point sounds superfluous or maybe even just a bad idea, since it works well as a mod manager, but this does follow the trend of companies like Ubisoft no longer pushing their own storefronts and such in favour of offering a seamless, Steam-ful experience. Oh, and there’s a bloody Kislev rework coming too. Huzzah!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Someone deep in the bowels of the internet once betwittered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> was "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> of RPGs". The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-early-access-review">back in 2016</a>. I didn't know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.</p>

<p>It's a wonderfully leery game. You have a button to piss, and another button dedicated to giving people the middle finger. You can get into rally races and mess up everything in the car you've spent the last few hours fixing. If you are emotionally broken and fall instantly in love with games that do not care about you as a person, then you will probably be head-over-heels for this.</p>
<p>Yet it is at least <em>slightly</em> more forgiving compared to its original release. You start with more food than a single pack of sausages, for example, and car parts no longer wear down over time but last forever. There's also a bus to prevent you getting stranded in the middle of nowhere when you run out of fuel - something that happened to me at least once in early access. </p><p>Other stuff has changed. There's a stress meter now, a moped to drive, and many new neighbours, farms, and factories to visit throughout the map. This includes at least one dude who'll gamble with you over a card game. I'm getting all this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDQBYcWoLEA">a handy video</a> which lists all the differences, great and small. I haven't actually played the latest version. I am too afraid. Reviewing this scrappy monster is a task I both dread and crave. </p>
<p>Developers AmisTech Games once <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/2220784205327276971?l=english">quietly mentioned</a> plans for a snowy sequel called My Winter Car. Getting the battered old summer beaut out the door was the priority, but the dev has recently confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/514071031546120457?snr=1_5_9_">an update post</a> that the sequel is still in "active development". If you're really impatient, there's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/2563">a wintry mod that jumped the gun</a>, adding snowy weather and other cold elements to the game. </p>
<p>If you're still wondering if this sim is as unusual as it seems from that trailer, you can get a taste of its bleak wackiness from various patch notes over the last nine years. Here are some of the best:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>You might now die from urinating into wrong places</li>
<li>Grandma might now want to get a ride to the church</li>
<li>Grandma now pays less if you have a prison tattoo</li>
<li>If Player passes out from drunkenness while having active Jail sentence he is transported back to Jail</li>
<li>Added TV to Jail</li>
<li>Cousin might now end up as your cellmate</li>
<li>Hangover is now best to be dealt with drinking alcohol</li>
<li>Jumping up from lowest crouch position is now an exercise method</li>
<li>Added lottery</li>
<li>Urine now accumulates if player keeps urinating on the house floor</li>
<li>Added Teletext to TV, use remote control to operate</li>
<li>You can now grill food on top of a hot Satsuma engine</li>
<li>Moose meat can be eaten after it has been grilled, similarly to fish</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And if you're still not convinced, marvel at <a href="http://www.amistech.com/msc/">the developer's website</a>. It is a thing of horrific beauty.</p></div>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a> and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory developers Splash Damage have cancelled Transformers: Reactivate, the Hasbro action game they announced in 2022. They will also be "scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects", and "a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485">TwiX post</a> in which Splash Damage describe Hasbro as "an incredible and supportive partner", and offer some, by now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">sadly overfamiliar</a> sentiments about this not being a decision they took "lightly". The post doesn't give any reason for the cancellation, beyond this being a "difficult time" for the studio.</p>
<p>There's been little to share about Transformers: Reactivate since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">reveal</a>, but the first cinematic trailer (below) paints the picture of a more soulful and seemingly, first-person action game in which the Autobots (good guy Transformers) fight a "Legion" of invading aliens. It would have supported co-op and yes, you would have been able to switch between bot and vehicular forms.</p>

<p>The trailer vibe suggests a grimmer experience than you'd generally get from Transformers, with apocalyptic urban scenes filmed at pedestrian level, and in-game technology that reminds me of Gears Of War. Speaking as a fan of Splash Damage's adaptation work with Gears Tactics, I approve of all this. Shortly after announcement, a social media user <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/transformers-reactivate-leak-playable-characters-starscream-soundwave-2014669/">leaked screens of a 2018 development build</a> which include several possible playable characters, straddling the Autobot and Decepticon (bad guy Transformers) divide: Starscream, Slipstream, Hotrod, Soundwave, Sunstreaker, Ironhide and Windblade.</p><p>Alongside the game's announcement back in 2022, Splash Damage revealed the acquisition of Derby-based developers Bulkhead, creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battalion-1944">Battalion 1944</a> and The Turing Test. Bulkhead have been working on the Transformers game alongside Wardogs, a combined-arms FPS with strategy game elements. I interviewed members of Bulkhead many moons ago, and thought they were a good bunch. </p>
<p>Transformers aside, Splash Damage are currently known to be working on <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/announcing-project-astrid/">Project Astrid</a>, an open world survival shooter set in an original universe, with input from streamers Sacriel and shroud.</p>
<p>It's possible the layoffs have to do with wider restructuring at Splash Damage's overall parent company Tencent, who were recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-rebukes-layoff-and-restructuring-rumours-but-admits-changes-at-the-top-of-the-company">rumoured</a> to be making significant reductions across their organisation. Tencent announced <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">layoffs at Sumo Group in June last year</a> followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-confirms-layoffs-at-sharkmob-london">layoffs at Sharkmob London in November</a>.</p>
<p>A few game developers have reacted to the Transformers: Reactivate cancellation on social media. "I enjoyed my time working on this, my heart goes out to all the talented Devs at splash &amp; bulkhead working on this," <a href="https://x.com/IdreeceHadi/status/1877048039262634179">wrote</a> Idreece Hadi, Cloud Imperium level designer and former Bulkhead game designer. "I hope you all get something in this troubling time, hopefully soon the industry gets some positive news this is terrible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
