            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod put together over the course of a 40 hour-long charity modathon will see you beamed up by aliens you're investigating on behalf of a quirky conspiracy theorist. Its creation alone has <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/9bfd5162-8a13-4012-908f-e64b4598976d/details">raised over $5,800</a> (about £4.2k) for the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> so far.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-voice-actor-is-teaming-up-with-top-fallout-4-modders-to-livestream-a-48-hour-modding-jam-for-charity">wrote about the plans to livestream this mod's creation</a> last month. The team behind Fallout 4's popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> are behind it, having teamed up with Wes 'Sheogorath' Johnson, a number of other voice actors and a group of prominent Fallout modders to make a cool thing with a bunch of moving parts in one weekend.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their creation, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/94745?tab=description">Transmission Zeta</a>, is now available to download via Nexus Mods. It looks like a fun time, though you might not dig the questline it offers if you're not down for plenty of silliness and Fallouty meta humour.</p>
<p>In line with what viewers voted for during a <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">June 14th planning stream</a>, that questline is all about aliens. The Zetans from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Mothership Zeta DLC have returned to The Commonwealth to get up to some abduction antics, along with various other cameos from across the Fallout series. You'll investigate with the aid of Clark, a zany conspiracy theorist voiced by Johnson, and the mod's fully-voiced follower, a vault dwelling con artist called Arlen.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The 40 hour Modathon is over, and you raised just shy of 10k across our events - and there's still one more to go!</p><p>Amazing work from all the modders who poured themselves into this!</p><p>Join <a href="https://twitter.com/GopherGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GopherGaming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WesJohnsonVoice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WesJohnsonVoice</a> tomorrow to watch the reveal of what we've assembled! <a href="https://t.co/c7CsW4Xb63">pic.twitter.com/c7CsW4Xb63</a></p></div>— simsettlements (@simsettlements) <a href="https://twitter.com/simsettlements/status/1939538383539417571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As you play through the quests and explore a new dungeon, one of which is called "V.A.T.S in Spaaace!", you'll gain some custom alien-themed weapons and armour made by modders Neeher and Niero. There's also a player home in the form of a houseboat with its own robot butler that modder Elianora's cooked up.</p>
<p>In order to start the mod's questline once it's installed, the modders write that you'll need to "simply pass through any load screen by fast traveling or entering and exiting a building", at which point a strange new radio station will pop up on your Pip-Boy. If you're not in the mood for modding or just want to get a taste of what you're in for, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0v7JSrvqB8">YouTuber Gopher</a> has livestreamed a playthrough of Transmission Zeta as part of the modathon.</p>
<p>If you are planning on playing the mod, you'll need version 1.10.163.0 or greater of Fallout 4 and all of its DLC aside from Far Harbor and the high-res texture pack.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to investigate this weird blue light that's just begun beaming down from the heavens outside my house.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-fallout-4-quest-mod-has-you-investigating-alien-abductions-for-an-iconic-elder-scrolls-voice-actor]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Mark Tyburn dreams of building the perfect video game," reads the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD">sales blurb</a> for Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's novel A Better Paradise: Volume One: An Aftermath, a title so resplendent with drive-by colons that you could easily guess this man spent thirty years working in videogames. "Kurt Fischer dreams of being a rich and successful executive. Daisy Tyburn dreams of having the ideal father. John Tyburn Smith dreams of fitting in. NigelDave just dreams of becoming human."</p>
<p>PleaseDon'tLetThatBeATypo, I immediately prayed to every god I knew the name of, and a few I made up on the spot. <em>Please let NigelDave be real</em>.</p>

<p>NigelDave is real. He's some sort of sentient AI, I think. And without really knowing anything about the setting, I actually quite like the idea of an AI picking two blokey first names in a sort of Ford Prefect, nicely inconspicuous way. He only wants to be loved, he says.</p>
<p><em>
I</em> love you, NigelDave.</p>
<p>A Better Paradise is Houser's multimedia project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-a-better-paradise-video-game-novel-grand-theft-auto-writer/1100-6532850/">note Gamespot</a>. Produced by his company Absurd Ventures, it's got its own <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/audiofiction">audiofiction series</a> starring Human Traffic's (and The Walking Dead's) Andrew Lincoln. Absurd Ventures also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game">announced last year</a> they were making an "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" set in the same universe.</p>
<p>A few of the novel's other characters also have voiced intro videos online. Here's a quote from Daisy Tyburn who, may I remind you, "dreams of having the ideal father". <em>The statistically perfect dad</em>. What's the Bechdel test but for before the character has spoken?</p>
<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/sGLPNgVSpYQ">I watch the people</a>, and the people are like robots and the robots are like people. People watch their screens and the screens watch people."</p>
<p>Gods, it's like reading Candide all over again. No one man should have access to such a dangerous combination of wit and prescience.</p>
<p>"Set in the near future, A Better Paradise tells the story of the ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong," continues the blurb. "As the software they developed starts to produce unexpected and disturbing results, the project is shut down and abandoned. Until now."</p>
<p>The book is out this year, October 14th. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/7GGKr1uCFAc">13 minute analysis of Grand Theft Auto 6's beer bottles</a> to keep you going in the wait for that game's release, currently slated for May 26th, 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-and-red-dead-redemption-writers-new-novel-is-about-ill-fated-game-development]]></content:encoded>
