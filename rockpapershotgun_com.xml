            <p>Naughty Dog have released a new mode for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> that lets you play out the events of the story in chronological order. Nobody who has ever read a single book can understand why.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby’s motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," say the studio in a<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/"> post introducing the new mode</a>. "While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II’s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>That important question which nobody asked. But who knows. Maybe this is great news to all those fans of The Last Of Us who dislike it when those UGH annoying storytellers at Naughty Dog do not adhere to the laws of temporal physics, telling another one of their bloody stories, but in the wrong direction. </p>
<p>"Through the new Chronological mode," say Naughty Dog, "we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more."</p>
<p>This is ominous behaviour and I do not agree with it, even if I am morbidly curious to see how batshittedly unhinged this makes the story of the game feel. Even the PlayStation's marketing spiel says that "Part II’s story is so meticulously put together" and they don't recommend this mode to new players. It might be an almost apologetic tone, were it not immediately followed by the other feature of this update: the ability to have Joel and Tommy cosplay as the Drake brothers from Uncharted.</p>

</figure>
<p>Naughty Dog call their new chronological mode "a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter." And I suppose that might be true. Imagine if Christopher Nolan released Dunkirk: The Chronological Cut. Imagine if Memento went forwards. Imagine Casablanca, but with Paris right at the start. Imagine 100 Years Of Solitude but cut up into strips of paper and sellotaped back into "proper" order. Are you drunk, Naughty Dog? You already made this game twice. Get back to work on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naughty-dog-are-making-a-sci-fi-bounty-hunter-game-called-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Akira-inspired space game</a>, and stop upsetting the entire internet. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-gets-new-mode-nobody-asked-for]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Have you recently lost a vehicle or item in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> in a fashion that wasn't your fault? If so, you may be entitled to in-game compensation from developers Funcom, who've said sorry for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> patch "oversight" that wiped out "an unfortunate amount" of bases and gear.</p>
<p>You won't even have to enlist the services of a friendly neighbourhood Lionel Hutz or Saul Goodman either, DA's devs are already working to send out replacement stuff to affected folks. They've also pledged to tackle the cheating and item loss due to bugs that've been plaguing the game since launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/">developer update post</a> Funcom have put live this fine morning, providing some nice June 9th breakfast reading. It kicks off with the Funcom team, including Dune: Awakening's Joel Bylos, saying sorry for technical missteps while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">working to rejig the Deep Desert</a> from PvP-only to a thing that also has a bunch of PvE zones.</p>
<p>"On <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards">Monday the 7th of July</a>, we patched out a layout change to the Deep Desert which caused several areas of the PvE Deep Desert to become PvP enabled," they wrote, "This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications, which led to people suffering an unfortunate amount of lost bases and equipment. This change was intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sleepers,<br>We’re aware of the issues affecting the game and have been working hard to address them.<br>We’d like to take a moment to share more details.<br>We sincerely apologize for the bumps along the way and thank you for your continued support.<a href="https://t.co/72G2LAorGK">https://t.co/72G2LAorGK</a> <a href="https://t.co/6hPCsQY1ZE">pic.twitter.com/6hPCsQY1ZE</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1942849463652872694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As well as making changes to their processes in the hopes of preventing this sort of thing from happening again, Funcom are working to "reimburse" affected players with vehicles and gear. The devs say "reimbursed materials, items, and vehicle components" should rock up in these players' claim rewards tab by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Alongside that, the studio say they're stepping up wider efforts to make sure folks get back any vehicles that end up being banished to the great worm void by bugs, something they say they "lacked the tooling and logging" to start doing right from launch. If your Ornithopter's gone walkies to the bug dimension, you can submit a ticket in-game that'll be added to the big pile that's now being worked through.</p>
<p>Finally, Funcom say their anti-exploit team are taking aim at eliminating all of the cheating and hacking that's frustrated folks playing properly so far. "Over the next few patches, they will be introducing additional efforts to prevent exploits by increasing security on several client/server communication layer, performing additional penetration testing against common attack vectors, and auditing our item and inventory systems to make sure they are resistant to item duplication," the devs wrote. </p>
<p>So, there you go. Funcom are on the case. Tell the suited sandworm you put through Harkonnen law school to stop shuffling papers in its teeth.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear]]></content:encoded>

Development team Lunar Software have finally posted an update about their first-person 80s-themed space horror, which had Craig Pearson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deserves-some-buzz-routine-is-amnesia-on-the-moon">rhapsodising about Kubrickian smoothies back in 2012</a>.

<p>2012! Why, it’s quite likely that <em>you</em>, dear reader, were born after this project entered development. If that’s the case, I don’t want to hear about it. Do not comment upon this article. Leave me to chew over my memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Do not sadden me with such bright-eyed and bushy-tailed observations as “oh wow, a triple-A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>”. Do not ask me to explain the 1980s. Hush now, go Tik a Tok or something.</p>
<p>While much-changed over the years, Routine remains a game about exploring a lunar colony that has succumbed to a creepy robot uprising. You get a handheld scanner that looks like an original Macintosh and seemingly avails you little against the saw-toothed sentinels that stalk these creaking corridors. The base appears quite capacious and (pre-droid apocalypse, anyway) cosmopolitan. As described in Lunar Software’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700">latest Steam post</a>, it includes a plaza where you’ll find tourist attractions, an arcade, and a mall. The post also digs into what’s been going on since the developers teamed up with publisher Raw Fury in 2022.</p>

<p>“Working on Routine has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing Routine,” the developers write. “But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>
<p>“In short, Routine is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>The game is the work of a core team of three, with additional contributors coming online at intervals. When they announced it, Lunar Software had Doom composer Mick Gordon on the books, but according to the new Steam post, he left the project in July 2024 due to “conflicts in his schedule”. Nonetheless, “Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for Routine” – the new audio designer and team will build on his labours.</p>
<p>When Routine was re-announced at Summer Game Fest in 2022, it had to worry about comparisons with fellow Alien-spawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fort-solis">Fort Solis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. Neither of those turned out to be very good. Fingers crossed Routine will be all the better for its marathon spell in development. Fingers crossed these promises of an imminent release announcement won't become - well, you know.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gorgeous-alien-style-space-horror-routine-is-finally-nearing-the-finish-line-despite-a-key-departure]]></content:encoded>
