            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is quite clearly a Halloween game. The thing about Halloween is that there should always be a little bit silliness amongst the horrific and the scary, and Yacht Club Games' next retro throwback seemed quite well fitted for the season. It was so appropriate that it was even planned to be released on October 31st! All of this to say, yes, Mina the Hollower is delayed, and it doesn't have a new release date either.
</p>
<p>
"The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet," Yacht Club Games explained in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a> announcing the delay. "This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." They also noted in the post that a new release date isn't being revealed just yet, as they're waiting until the game is submitted to its various platforms.
</p>
<p>
To be fair, it is apparently "so close to being done," and it sounds like it's only smaller things like finalising design, art, and sound, balance tweaks, localisation testing, platform testing, and the act of eating cheese that's holding up the release that was meant to take place this month.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this is definitely a bit of a shame as I have been hankering for something akin to the GBC Zelda games, and I love a Halloween activity given I am not too far away from my thirties and am very childless so trick or treating is not something I can partake in. On the other hand, as ever there are too many games - both Unbeatable and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> are launching in the first half of November, and boy howdy do I not have the time for either of them.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed Yatch Club Games find a new release date soon enough! And selfishly, one that's far away from other games I also want to play.
