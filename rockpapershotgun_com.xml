            <p>Remember Prototype, the super hero game which saw Radical Entertainment explore what might happen if a hoodie enthusiast was given shape-shifting powers? Well, it's recieved a sudden and mysterious steam update which adds to its credits, fuelling a fresh bout of speculation that a remaster might be on the cards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said Steam update, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/a-surprise-steam-update-for-prototype-broke-the-mods-making-the-16-year-old-game-playable-on-modern-systems-but-could-hint-at-a-potential-remaster/">Perfectly Cromulent Gamer</a>, is so mysterious that it didn't even come with a handy post indicating what it did, leaving modders and dataminers to try and work out what it was up it with its around 600 MBs of pure enigma.</p>
<p>Based on what they've discovered, the answer includes making some noteworthy additions to Prototype's credits. These include staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned studio that's worked on the likes of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy</a>, amid a lengthy history littered with numerous ports and support projects. Fellow Activision support studios Beenox and Demonware get mentions too, with the former seeing a huge number of folks credited. Finally, a Ubisoft Connect iteration of Prototype, which isn't a thing that currently exists, is also mentioned via references to supposed contributors to it that includes the Beenox devs.</p>
<p>You can find the old credits laid side by side with the revised ones <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/">here</a>, thanks to the Prototype community's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/">super sleuths</a>. Naturally, the conclusion many of these folks have drawn is that some sort of re-release of the 2009 game may be in the works. There's no official confirmation as of yet, however, so make sure to keep your expectations in check.</p><p>I'll admit that for all I've enjoyed plenty of Infamous, I've never gotten around to giving Prototype a go. So let us peruse RPS co-founderperson Alec Meer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-prototype">late 2000s thoughts on it</a> together, in order to help decide whether it's worthy of a modern revamp:</p>
<blockquote> Morality is non-existent in this game of mass, consequence-free killing, after all. All I know: half of Prototype wants me to have sustained, undiluted fun. The other half wants to keep that fun from me at all costs. This is a game that regularly strikes close an unprecedented degree of fantastical wish-fulfilment, but similarly seems determined to punish anyone with the temerity to play it.</blockquote>
<p>I'd say that's a yes, especially given it's a ballache to play on modern PCs without relying on mods like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">PrototypeFix</a>, which in a fun twist the suprise update tempoarily rendered unusable. Luckily, the mod's creator was quick to update it, so you can hop into some working Prototype if this news leaves you keen to re-don Alex Mercer's hood of moodiness.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> arrives on October 10th, but the recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">purchased by new owners</a> EA and DICE have decided not to bother waiting until it's launched to detail their plans for its first few seasonal updates. Two new game modes will be rocking up, followed by a romantic winter getaway in New York.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">first season</a> of free updates to the shooter begins on October 28 with the arrival of the first add-on, Rogue Ops. That'll bring with it Strikepoint, a new four versus four mode about capturing an objective in a fight which only offers you one life per round. There's a fresh map called Blackwell Fields, which is big enough to offer "support for all combat sizes" as well as land and air vehicles, amid the sea of oil derricks in its recently recommissioned California air base. On top of those are a new Armored Personnel Carrier and three new weapons.</p>
<p>Next up's a November 18th update dubbed California Resistance, which brings Sabotage - a new eight versus eight mode. Destroying as many "sites" as possible before the round expires is the goal, with teams swapping between offense and defense. There'll be another new map dubbed Eastwood, which is a "a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course" into which evil mercenaries Pax Armata have inserted some sleeper agents they've since woken. So, just agents then.</p>
<p>Battle pickups offering the usual powerful weapons that use up quicker than you can say 'bang bang' will also arrive, alongside two more new guns.</p>
<p>Finally, a Winter Offensive will be launched on December 9th, headlined by the Ice Lock limited time event, which is all about freezing your foes. The Empire State map'll get a snowy makeover in lieu of any fresh locations to shoot a virtual person, and you'll be handed an ice axe melee weapon to probably not use for its intended climbing purpose. There's no evidence of any Santa outfit skins so far, lest you think Battlefield's anything other than a serious, grounded shooter with serious, grounded soldiers fighting over serious ground.</p><p>Not 128 serious grounded soldiers at a time though, as was the case in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, with Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-128-players-too-much-for-a-multiplayer-fps-yes-says-battlefield-6">having recently chatted a bit</a> about the call to go back to 64 as the max per-match.</p>
