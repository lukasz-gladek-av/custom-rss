            <p>
Right, here's your prescribed dose of actual nice news in the games industry for the week. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is back from the dead! Despite a decade's worth of development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the game was canned</a> with Hypixel Studios forced to completely shutter. Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">did say he wanted to talk to previous owner Riot about re-acquiring Hytale</a>, and as it turns out, that's exactly what he did!
</p>
<p>
"A new and exciting chapter for Hytale begins today," begins a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">blog post</a> from the Hytale Team. "We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games. While it didn't make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible."
</p>
<p>
The good news continues on from here, as apparently more than 30 developers "who know this game inside and out" have been rehired, "with additional returns expected in the coming days. Together, we are going back to the original vision for Hytale. We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years." Gosh, ain't that just a nice thing to read for once?
</p>
<p>
Said blog post outlined a few behind the scenes bits too. For one, the game has switched back to the Legacy Engine it was being made on previously, with the game now being playable and the post explaining that it "lets us build a game rather than an engine. It's the version that feels like what Hytale was supposed to be."
</p><p>
In the coming days, an early access date will apparently be announced, and pricing alongside that. Setting some expectations, the post notes that early access will take at least a few years, and that at launch the game will only feature exploration mode, creative mode, and modding - no minigames or adventure mode, but they are both still planned. Good luck with it all, Hytale team!

        <p>In this games industry? Who's surprised</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since Yoko Taro has made a game, hasn't it? That last public (key word here) thing he worked on was a mobile game about how Sega controls pretty much everything called 404 Game Re:set in 2023 (it shut down in 2024). Before that was a trio of Voice of Cards games in 2021/22, and before that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant</a> not-quite-a-remake and also now defunct mobile game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. In terms of the big thing that everyone wants, a non-gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game, things have been very quiet, but that can be said of Taro's work as a whole. Apparently, though, that's not for lack of trying.
</p>
<p>
The developer recently made an appearance at Korean video game convention G-CON 2025, where alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> director Hideki Kamiya he spoke of his approach to game design (via <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a>, translations by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>). On the topic of this idea that he's not working right now, Taro had this to say: "I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development." Ah. That's a tad awkward, and upsettingly common.
</p>
<p>
"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day," Taro continued. "I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."
</p>
<p>
I would like to be very clear here that I have no idea what Taro may have been working on, and what the status of a hypothetical Nier game might currently be. But, if you're the kind of person that likes to have a moan at game devs on Vitter, maybe cut Taro some slack. And maybe do that for literally everyone, actually.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is due out in early access later this week, and ahead of that developer PlayerUnknown Productions laid out a little roadmap of updates you can expect in the coming… months? They didn't specify, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - I think setting expectations of when certain features may arrive encourages a more demanding audience - but they did give a good overview of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
Starting things off is a list of plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's world and environment, which primarily focus on adding "realism, scale, and cohesion to the world." Namely, that includes things like paths and trails that are clearer in how you're meant to navigate them, alongside river systems with "source, tributaries, rapids, and deltas, bringing new movement and life to the world." Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS1HIci4hQ">Any Austin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And there's also plans for more varied settlements, alongside water that freezes and thaws depending on the weather and season. That one sounds quite neat! I feel like the effects of weather is a thing that many games still don't get quite right yet, hopefully something systems driven like this can have a good crack at it.
</p>
<p>
On the gameplay side of things, there's plans to expand on the game's building system, to add in new ingredients and recipes, make it so that you might need batteries or to repair a power system, and to make it so that clothing can degrade over time, but be fixed too.
</p><p>
More miscellaneously, the <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/prologue-go-wayback-early-access-roadmap">roadmap</a> also outlines its intention to add in full controller support, Steam Deck support, an in-game camera mode, and for the streamer out there, Twitch integration that allows viewers to mess with spawns and other bits. More ambitiously (and I question whether this will be the game's downfall), the game will also let you build your own worlds, rules, maps, and experiences to share with others. Not everything needs to have user-generated bits, but Prologue: Go Wayback will have them whether it needs them or not.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to pick up Prologue: Go Wayback when it enters early access November 20th.
