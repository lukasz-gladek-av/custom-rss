            <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year to some critical acclaim, and it has now made its way both west and onto PC. The PC version has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2731870/announcements/detail/4554919920318276609">bunch of graphical upgrades</a> and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC</a> - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.

<p>Ys X again stars pretty boy protagonist Adol, but this time is teamed-up with pirate Karja. Yes, that means there's ship-shaped exploration and combat. If you don't have a co-op buddy to play with, you can switch between both characters on the fly or control them together, and build their "Revenge Guage" to do combined attacks.

<p>The Ys series started all the way back in the '80, but it's been gaining in popularity in recent years, particularly on PC. Monstrum Nox was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/japanese-games-dominated-steams-july-top-sellers">a Steam best seller in July 2021</a>, and genre expert Nadia Oxford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">thought it was the perfect entrypoint to the series</a>. 
</p><p>I am yet to make my own entrance into the Ys series, and I confess, I've never fought a naval battle I've enjoyed. If I want to slowly circle an enemy I do not understand while taking potshots at it, then I will write news posts about RPG series I've never played, thanks. I do wish I had time to experience its blue skies and grappling hooks, though. Maybe if I ever finish Ni no Kuni. 
</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/">available from Steam</a>. It's £55/€60/$60 and there's a demo where your save can carry over to the full game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
