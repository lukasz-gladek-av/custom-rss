Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is wonderful for that plumber guy, but mostly meant piss all for us PC people. The thing is, this version of the game actually comes with some new stuff, and I like new stuff, and publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> only vaguely said all the new bits would be coming to "other platforms". But! I bring good news, as yes, the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition extras are coming to PC as part of a Tarnished Pack DLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This comes from the first FromSoftware Games Event Spring 2025, held earlier today, which <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a> covered and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others">RPG Site</a> kindly extrapolated details from. Now, to be clear, there aren't many details, but something is better than nothing. For one, there'll be a total of four new armour sets to acquire. On top of that there's two new starting classes, Knight of Ides, and Heavy Armored Knight, both of which are, you guessed it, knights! Not particularly exciting given that there's already some knight options, but what can you do? These two knights make up two of the four new armour sets.
</p>
<p>
You'll also have a total of three new looks for your trusty steed Torrent, which I suppose is more than the none you could choose from before. Apparently some more weapons and skills are being added into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> too. At the very least, FromSoftware did say that the DLC pack will be cheap for those not on Switch 2, though I am a bit surprised this isn't just coming in the form of a free update.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is cross our fingers that that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Not Bloodborne 2 But It's Basically Bloodborne 2 Except It's An Online Game game The Duskbloods</a> comes to PC eventually too.

Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sims</a> already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-seikyu">Tales of Seikyu</a>, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/">early access on Steam</a> this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there).

The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute!
</p>
<p>
There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's "secrets." I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.
