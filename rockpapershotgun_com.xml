            <p>There's no perfect time to release a video game, but if I were deciding when to release one, do you know when I'd do it? Alongside the largest blockbusters of the year, at a time when everyone is broke from buying presents, and on the same day as a huge awards show is distracting the industry's media. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ballionaire">Ballionaire</a> apparently shares my thinking. The pachinko-inspired roguelike is launching on December 10th.

<p>"Pachinko-inspired" might conjure certain images, and recent pachinko roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> among them. Ballionaire takes a different tact, with no traditional goblin-based combat staredown at the top of the screen. Instead, players are charged with designing the pachinko bored itself, placing different kinds of pegs in advance of their ball's descent. Pegs include axes which cut you in half, so you continue tumbling in multiple directions, and teleporters, which shift you back to the top of the board. The aim is to collect as much cash as possible, with the gadgets helping to prolong and multiply your physicsy journey.
</p><p>There's then a roguelike wrapper around this bally good time: it's run-based, there are many different boards to encounter, there are between-board upgrades, and so on. There's also a sandbox mode if you just want some free balls, and best of all, mod support that allows folks to script their own pegs.
</p>
<p>Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ballionaire-is-a-pachinko-roguelike-where-you-build-your-board-as-you-play">loved the demo</a> when he played it during Next Fest in October. That demo is no longer available, but I'm looking forward to giving the full game a go - whenever I manage to find the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I had a few merry evenings playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-simulator">Escape Simulator</a> back in 2022. Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.
</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will explore "darker escape room themes", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

<p>Why a sequel, when the original was already being so regularly updated? "A sequel gives us a fresh start and lets us push the limits of the genre further," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">the Steam page</a>. "We were inspired to explore darker escape room themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle ideas. Splitting from the original game let us focus on improving key features like rendering, networking, physics, and animations."
</p><p>I'm not really sure what "darker" means in the context of solving silly pattern matching puzzles with my pals, but Pine Studio also clarify that although "darker and has a more mysterious vibe, it's not a horror game." It does not feature "any jump scares or gore." Good! That's not what I play these games for. I play them for the feeling of inferiority that comes from having my co-op mates solve all the puzzles faster than I can.
</p>
<p>The original Escape Simulator came with a toolkit with which community members made many, many escape rooms of their own. The sequel follows suit, but promises that Room Editor 2.0 will be "more powerful and intuitive", with fewer restrictions when compared the way they make the official rooms.
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, but some of the locations at launch include Dracula's castle, a starship stranded after a collision, and a pirate ship. Until you can escape those you might like to try the original, and it's currently 50% reduced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/">on Steam</a> - and it ain't exactly pricey to begin with.

            <p>This happened on Thursday, but we were busy with other, less interesting news. Late or not, I can't let it pass unremarked upon: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a>, the vast, weird roguelike which has been in development for 17 years, hit version 1.0. It brings multiple endings to the game, a revised UI, improved tutorials and much more.

<p>Caves Of Qud's 1.0 release has been polished up with some help from publisher Kitfox, known for - aside from their own games - working to bring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> to Steam. Caves Of Qud has a complex, reactive, detailed world, but it's worth stating that it was never as obtuse in its menus or controls as its peer. To aid those who do want to jump onboard, Kitfox worked with YouTuber SBPlaysGames to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtvzwK2jzY&amp;ab_channel=KitfoxGames">an official beginner's tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4440081939137824126">on Steam</a>, the developers answered the inevitable "what's next" question. After 17 years of work, they're going to take a break, they say. "After that, we plan to continue updating the game, with two big feature arcs already in mind. Whether those are free updates or paid DLC has yet to be determined."
</p><p>I'm glad that they're still excited to work on new ideas for Caves Of Qud, but I do hope Freehold Games also turn their attention to a new game one day. It seems unlikely that we'll ever get to see that from Dwarf Fortress's developers, but I want to know what comes next from a team willing to work on such large projects.
</p>
<p>We haven't had a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">Marsh skated across its mutant pond</a> upon its arrival in Steam Early Access nine years ago. Now that Brendy is done with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-a-grand-adventure-that-keeps-faith-with-the-movies">Indy's tombs</a>, he's going to turn his attention to Qud's caves for a review before the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
