            <p>Boy, that escalated quickly. Less than a day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s PvE patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">went into public testing</a>, changes that turn the "entire southern half" of the Deep Desert into a PvE area have been hotfixed into the full game.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death">promised change</a> arrives alongside the first of the scout ornithopter balancing tweaks Funcom talked about in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">recent AMA</a>, and a couple of other fixes. However, there's a bunch of stuff put into testing yesterday which hasn't yet made the jump to public release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546739082808525243?l=english">hotfix 1.1.0.17</a>, the biggest thing it does is change the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> so that the entire southern half of it is made up of PvE areas - a pretty hefty scaling back of the PvP zones it comprised on release. This is in line with what creative director Joel Bylos said in a recent post addressing PvE and PvP concerns.</p>
<p>To ensure the area retains plenty of "Risk vs Reward" for competitive players, the PvP-filled northern part of it contains the densest deposits of valuable resources, the largest spice fields, and most of the control points.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The servers are now coming back online and patch notes for 1.1.0.17 are available.<br>We have some changes following the message from our Creative Director in this one!<a href="https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7">https://t.co/mPZhBBgNq7</a><br>Remember to restart your Steam client if the download does not appear! <a href="https://t.co/1WP0uBv2mk">pic.twitter.com/1WP0uBv2mk</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1938151078337376594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Funcom have made some further balancing tweaks in light of the change, writing: "The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a 'first come, first served' basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest."</p>
<p>If you want to max out the number of schemactics you grab each week, you'll also need to visit Imperial Testing Stations in both PvE and PvP areas. If you're a bit taken aback by how quickly these changes have jumped from testing into the full game, like some players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lkui75/11017_patch_notes/">Reddit</a> and Discord, Funcom have made clear they'll make further adjustments based on player feedback if needs be. By putting these changes live for everyone, they're bound to get plenty.</p>
<p>Outside of that, the devs have started making tweaks to balance Ornithopters with this hotfix. Equipping a rocket launcher to your bird will now slow it down by 20% if it's a Scout Ornithopter, and 10% if it's an Assault one.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how this pretty huge shift in DA's endgame area plays out. It's proven pretty polarising so far, so it'll be interesting to see whether folks come around to it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Kindly Father Internet has dispensed a few new details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a>, Rogue Trader developer Owlcat’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">recently announced</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adaptation of the sci-fi book and TV series. It sounds like it’s operating within the fine tradition of spin-off stories that are always a step behind or a room across from the live action celebrities.</p>
<p>I refer to games like The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, in which the noble human ranger Alsogorn, the stout dwarven warrior Simarli, the shieldmaiden Eowynnish and the other members of the Followship of the Ring pitch in with Gandalf, Faramir and co in scenes that might have been lifted from Petey Jackson's cutting room floor. Except that turning the Balrog bridge fight into a five-way Final Fantasy slapfest is just naff.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Osiris Reborn will hopefully not be naff, going by Owlcat’s prior work in the party-based RPG space, and in light of the game’s admittedly target-footagesque announcement trailer. It takes place in parallel to the first two seasons of the Expanse TV show, and gives you a new set of characters. Things kick off on Eros Station, an asteroid city that takes a turn for the Eventfully Horizontal in the original James S.A. Corey books. The infamous protomolecule makes an appearance, as do corpo shitlords Protogen, and you'll hear a lot about the doings of a certain James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante.

"You will be seeing with your own eyes the repercussions of Holden's actions, all the situations like The Canterbury, and how it affects people in the belt, people in the inner planets," observes creative director Alexander Mishulin in a chat with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-will-take-cues-from-mass-effect-souls-games-and-more/">CNET</a>. "You will be having your own adventure with your own goals, choices, consequences in the same universe [with] all the major events unfolding in this universe alongside your story." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> aside, Mishulin says that the storytelling is “similar” to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> in how your party members develop over the course of the tale. Crew members who don’t join your three-person away missions won’t twiddle their thumbs in your absence – they can go on jaunts elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for the other kind of character development, making numbers go up and down, “the RPG system is very open, allowing you to build whatever character you like”. There are no classes, which may come as a relief to those of us racked and corroded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>’s cyclopean skilltrees. Seemingly, there is a stronger emphasis on how weapons shape your approach than in previous Owlcat RPGs, though that’s me peering between the lines of the CNET piece. Gadgets include a visor that lets you identify foes through smoke and cover, which isn’t too mindblowing, but definitely helpful. 
</p>
<p>
The game courts the same “hard sci-fi” feel as the show, including the "feeling of the physics and how it should be" in outer space. The protomolecule in the ointment is that while you’ll get your own, lightly customisable ship and be able to fly around in it, they’re won’t be any ship-to-ship combat. No emergency deceleration manoeuvrers, no intricate missile tactics. I guess I’ll have to get my fill of that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.

            <p>The American Federal Trade Commission has given out a further $126 million (around £91 million) in refunds to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players who've been "charged for unwanted purchases", bringing the overall total issued so far to about $200 million. It's also given eligible players who're yet to submit a refund claim some extra time to do so.</p>
<p>These refunds are the ongoing fallout to a pair of complaints made to the FTC over Fortnite, which Epic opted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-settle-fortnite-privacy-and-purchase-complaints-for-520-million">settle in late 2022</a> by paying a combined total of $520 million (£427 million). Epic were accused of breaching the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting data on under 13 Fortnite players without parental consent, and deliberately using tactics such as confusing button placements intended to push folks into buying cosmetics from the Fortnite store unintentionally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The latter of those is what these refunds from the FTC are being issued to remedy, with $245 million of the settlement gradually being given out to affected players in the US. This <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims">latest $126 million wave of refunds</a> is the second one, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement">the first</a> having totalled over $72 million and been issued in December 2024.</p>
<p>The FTC says it's sending out "969,173 checks and PayPal payments" across June 25 and 26 this time around, so it's worth taking a look in those two places if you submitted a claim, as the body encourage cashing or accepting it within 90 days or 30 days respectively. They also note that claims made later than February 14, 2025 are still being reviewed.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process. Players who have not already filed a claim will now have until July 9 to submit one: <a href="https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z">https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z</a></p>— FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you're in America and meet the rest of the criteria <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds">outlined here</a>, you can still apply for a Fortnite refund for a little while longer, with the FTC having reopened claims until July 9.</p>
<p>Games should go above and beyond to make sure players even more clearly understand when they are making a purchase with real money or with virtual currencies to prevent accidental purchases," Epic wrote in a statement issued about the settlement back in 2022.</p>
<p>"We don’t want players to pay for something that they did not intend to," they continued, "Since May 2018, Fortnite has had a refund token system and an undo-purchase system, but now we've gone further. We’ve updated our payment flows with a hold-to-purchase mechanic that re-confirms a player’s intent to buy, as an additional safeguard to prevent unintended purchases alongside instant purchase cancellations and self-service refunds."</p>
<p>Here's hoping everyone affected gets the refund they deserve.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-players-receive-126-million-more-in-refunds-from-the-ftc-over-epics-deceptive-billing-practices]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer Cyber Temple were kind enough to send me a preview build. Pre-warning: I only played an hour, because I didn't enjoy it very much. So, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3132870/DarkSwitch/">Steam sell</a> in case you want to ignore my opinions and just pop it on the wishlist for the inevitable demo - something I always heartily recommend.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Gather resources, research technologies, and send pioneers to explore the ruins of those who came before: discover their secrets and doom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set in a world of folk horror and creeping dread, DarkSwitch blends vertical city-building, tower defense, and exploration into a unique strategic experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navigate a stunning, dangerous, dark fantasy world enriched by cinematic cutscenes and an atmospheric soundtrack from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Opinion the first, they only get worse: Akira Yamaoka is phoning it in. The music is pleasant and richly layered but nothing to write home about, unless perhaps you haven't spoken to your family in yonks and need a very tenuous coversation starter. Ah well! You play as a colony of elves and their architecture is suitably Rivendallian. Being elves they think they know it all and don't bother giving you much onboarding. This where the issues start. A style over substance UI. Exclamation points appear over buildings with no indication of what they mean. There's a counter down the right hand side of the screen, no tooltips or other explanations, ditto the 'Fear' counter in the top right.</p>
<p>The tutorial, such as it is, tells you <em>what</em> to do, but not how to do it. Not too tricky to work out, usually. But crucially, you're not told <em>why</em> you're doing it either. My people are hungry so I need to collect mushrooms, I can work that out. But what am I placing two 'flame guards' down? A tooltip tells me they have something to do with the fog that creeps in at night, and my citizens, but I'm given no further explanation and no indication of where to place to them. And the more crucial thing here is, since the game seems to be working backwards in terms of goals and motivations, there's little of Frostpunk's demanding energy or intrigue. I eventually peace out after digging in every menu for a tutorial-demanded building extension I just can't find.</p>
<p>Also, look. I've previously bemoaned the state of latent paranoia that the proliferation of AI art encourages, turning us all into little art purity witchhunters whenever something <em>might</em> be machine generated. All I'm saying is, if I perhaps wanted to avoid such speculation, I would not have gone for this particular look with the character portraits:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Apologies to Eldric Flambet. And that said, I really like how this wooden walkway automatically connects between buildings, and also how you can build structures on the trunk of the tree itself, Ewok style:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Cyber Temple</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do still think the concept is really compelling. The writing is terse and veers simple but does its job. Some culty flamemen called Luminarchs show up in an airship after a bit and start interrogating and stealing my townsfolk. I'd like to know where that goes. And it's a pre-demo press preview build, right? I'm sure the developer sent it out because they know it isn't quite where they need it to be and wanted to see how the press reacted, so here's my reaction: sort out the first hour. Make me obsessed with your world rather than just a bit irritated at what parts you've seemingly randomly chosen to obscure from me, and give me an interesting goal straight away rather than just telling me to build things with no real sense of what I'm working towards. Otherwise: Nice elvish buildings. Nice concept. And, yes, very nice tree (hey!)</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkswitch-is-frostpunk-in-a-big-tree-with-music-from-silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka]]></content:encoded>

<p>The twist here is that you'll be trying to keep your midnight proclivities a secret from the townfolk, brushing the proverbial Chocolate Hobnob crumbs of forbidden arcane arts out of your beard and burning the packet before everyone else wakes up. There's a sort of social stealth system, too, that sees you chocolate hobnobbing at high society parties, presumably trying to not open every conversation with "Hi I'm Terry and all my mates are animated cadavers". There's also an excellent fully illustrated spellbook.</p>
<p>CRPGs come in a few flavours usually. You've got your swordies and wordies and the occasional nicely balanced swordy-wordy. NecTales has hex-based combat where you cast spells, backed up by your gang of flaky shamblers and clattering calcium lads, but otherwise looks to be hanging about on the wordy side of the scale. "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore," to be precise, alongside hand-drawn portraits for 180+ NPCs. "We have not used any generative AI in the game", say developers Psychic Software. Good by me. If I wanted to engage with a pallid, grotesque simulacrum of something real, I'd raise another zombie.</p>
<p>The game is set near alternate history Venice on the cusp of the Enlightenment - a setting apparently rife for exacerbated tensions between science and superstition. This history is not so alternative, however, as to prevent Twickenhamese satirist Alexander Pope popping up in the corner, presumably to bang on about Homer to anyone in earshot.</p>
<p>The Necromancer's Tale is out next month, July 17th. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">demo on Steam</a> available now.
