            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> - the 2006 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Obsidian based on D&amp;D 3.5 - is getting an Enhanced Edition, and it's out next month. 'Enhanced' in this case means nicer textures, camera improvements, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> and controller compatibility, and Steam Workshop mod integration. It's out next month, July 15th.</p>

<p>It also includes three story expansions. If that's simply not enough <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> for you, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">bundle on Steam currently</a> where you can buy both this and the original NN - also in Enhanced Edition form - for 10% off. This would require pre-ordering, however. It's like I always say: if someone has to bribe you into doing something, it's surely a brilliant idea. Here's Steam on the matter of the affairs of the particulars of the videogame at hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Return to the city of Neverwinter in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition. A dark force sweeps over Faerûn, ravaging everything in its path as though searching for something – something that you now find in your possession. As the Shard-Bearer, only you can stop the King of Shadows and his army from desecrating the land you call home. Will you save Faerûn, or fall victim to the temptation of absolute power? When your actions dictate the fate of the Realms, there are no small choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet there are <em>some</em> small choices, really. That's just good writing. How do you make the big choices seem big otherwise? Please, consider your hyperbole for one second, advertising blurb.</p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition">Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition</a> was handled by Beamdog. They've since been gobbled up by Aspyr, themselves a gobbling appendage of chief gobblers Embracer, and it's Aspyr on both enhancing and publishing duties this time around. Being long in the tooth by now, the Neverwinter Nights games have built up a decent modding community over the years, and the minimal amount of research I've done suggests that mods for the original NN worked fine with the 2018 EE. Assuming that's the case for this new one, it means you'll be able do things like play the entire <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/neverwinter2/mods/794">Baldur's Gate 1 campaign inside of it</a>.</p>
<p>Here's John's (RPS in peace) diary series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-bastard-in-neverwinter-part-one-bastardly-beginnings">A Bastard In Neverwinter</a> if you're curious to learn how Neverwinter Nights 2 reacts to proto-Dark Urge shenanigans, and also just find the word 'bastard' inherently funny enough to force at least once into most articles you write, like some sort of marauding crambastard.</p></div>

        <p>Team Cherry's sliced through any confusion</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The collective desperation for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has evolved. Rather than people getting all up a height about the prospect of getting any news about it, they've now been left up a height due to confusion around some news they have gotten about the game. Cue Team Cherry having to step in to offer a bit of clarification about Silksong's Xbox Showcase cameo yesterday.</p>
<p>In case you were washing your hair, Silksong popped up during the bit that saw Microsoft introduce its handheld, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">the ROG Xbox Ally</a>. There was the usual hardware spinning around and looking cool, plus Xbox's Sarah Bond saying when Silksong popped up on the handheld's screen that the game'll be "available at launch and in Game Pass when the Ally releases later this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter confusion from some fans as to whether Silksong's release was tied to the handheld's release in "holiday 2025". Don't worry, it isn't.</p>
<p>Team Cherry marketing and publishing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin has made as much very clear via the long-suffering fan hive that is the Silksong Discord server. "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," he wrote of the game's release date, "we are not tied to a console release." He then added that Christmas was what he meant by holiday, just to make totally sure there was no room for misinterpretation.</p>

</figure>
<p>To give you an idea of the confusion that had followed the Xbox showcase appearance, these posts came in response to a Discord user with the wonderful handle fleetwood_bigmac asking Griffin for confirmation that Silksong was still on track to release before 2026. The dev replied "wait...what?" to that, likely realising that even if it was trolling, making things clear to the hardcore skongers beyond all doubt was probably a good shout.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming before Christmas 2025, possibly before September given a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">certain confirmed cameo</a> down under, and its release isn't tied to Xbox's new game playing box.</p>
<p>To be fair, we learned the date that Silksong will be playable as part of an Australian museum exhibit before we got a full release date for it, so you can't really blame fans for not knowing whether they're coming or going at this point. They've spent part of the last few years doing stuff like trying to read into comments on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">cake recipes</a> and their brains are just begging for straight, indisputable answers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
