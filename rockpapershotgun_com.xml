            <p>The more I tell you about <a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a>, the less funny it will be, so let's keep this brief. It's an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more "stimulation" you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer's processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.</p><!--more-->
<p>Stimulation Clicker angles forward and backward through the history of the internet. On the one hand, it's a merciless piece of trolling that tramples all over nerve endings worn to the hilt by the web 3.0 era of hyper-velocity enshittification. On the other, it's a testament to the expressive power of HTML, a reminder of those glory days 20 years ago when every website was a wishing well full of elusive or hidden moving parts and connections, including digital will-o'-the-wisps called "pop ups" that, back then, were a source of wonder and curousity. You'd even click on them, occasionally! Awwwwww. I miss the internet being good.</p>
<p>Thanks to reader jamhandy for spotting Stimulation Clicker and chucking it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-26">the latest Maw liveblog</a>. I'm reviewing an open world game at the minute, and this was exactly the change of pace I was looking for, though I do now have a bit of a complex about owls and the Welsh. The creator is <a href="https://neal.fun/">Neal Agarwal</a>, whose other works include the alchemical monstrosity that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/infinite-craft-is-a-browser-game-in-which-you-can-craft-anything-from-god-to-minecraft">Infinite Craft</a>.</p>
<p>For a more involved and narrative-led take on the above, mushy sentiments about the lost enchantment of webpages, play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-amazing-surprising-browser-game-shows-the-internet-can-still-be-magical">corru.observer</a>, which Alice0 (RPS in peace) called "one of the most surprising and delightful games I've played all year, a sprawling, shape-shifting sci-fi story which is still unfolding through updates". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra</a> chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a> hardware announcements.</p>
<p>No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t bet against the Ryzen 9 9950X3D nabbing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s crown as the king of gaming CPUs, though whether it (and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D) are actually worth buying will surely come down to price. The 9800X3D is already a super-duper-premium part, and won’t stop bossing games just because something with 24MB more cache comes along, so it could feasibly remain the one to upgrade to if you don’t do the kind of multitasking or media work that would benefit from the added threads.</p><p>AMD’s new handheld processors, also unveiled at CES, are a more diverse bunch. In addition to the Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme – direct replacements for the Z1 chips powering handhelds like the Asus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> – there’s also a Ryzen Z2 Go designed for cheaper portables. It’s this modest, 4 core/8 thread part that forms the brain of the $599 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that also got a CES reveal yesterday.</p>

<p>Curiously, these are a mishmash of various generations of AMD Zen CPU and RDNA graphics tech: the Ryzen Z2 Extreme combines Zen 3 and Zen 5c cores, as well as RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, while the standard Z2 is built around RDNA 3. The Z2 Go relies on the even older RDNA 2, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s custom AMD APU, so it’ll be interesting to see how the three compare when actually running games. Just don’t expect that to happen on a new Deck version, as Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b">Bluesky</a> to shut down rumours of a Z2-powered Steam Deck successor.</p>

<p>Also curious was the lack of detail AMD gave their other 'big' announcement, the first RDNA 4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. No specs, price, release window, nada. They exist. That’s your lot. It took a since-deleted Asus post (well caught, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-might-have-told-us-little-about-its-rdna-4-graphics-cards-but-at-least-we-know-the-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-have-16-gb-of-vram/">PCG</a>) to even let slip that they’d come with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>And yet, this dearth of info didn’t stop AMD from letting our Ziff cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-benchmark">IGN</a> from testing out the RX 9070 on the show floor. In an Extreme-quality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> benchmark at native 4K, it averaged 99fps, which IGN reckon puts it roughly on par with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review">GeForce RTX 4080 Super</a>. Not bad going, except the latter is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">replaced by the RTX 5080</a> at the end of this month, seemingly without significant price bump. As with pretty much of all of AMD’s CES reveals – interesting on paper yet light on performance specifics – we’ll have to wait and see how they do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">reported</a> that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.</p>
<p>At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.</p><!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">statement in full</a> is rather robotic, and mostly just fleshes out the spokesperson's previous argument that Tencent is not, in fact, involved with anything military. It further argues that Tencent is not a "military-civil fusion", in response to the US defence department's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023145/dod-releases-list-of-chinese-military-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1260/">standing claim</a> that China's armed forces rely on "technology and expertise" provided by Chinese "companies, universities and research programs" that "appear to be civilian entities".</p>
<p>"As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the [Chinese Military Company] List is a mistake," the statement reads. "Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group."</p><p>The statement also specifies that the "CMC list" - which was introduced under the first Trump presidency, and is known inside the US government as the Section 1260H list - is distinct from another document, the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List, maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The point being that "inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company".</p>
<p>Tencent are about "to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake", during which they "will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List."</p>
<p>If it comes to a lawsuit, Tencent won't be the first Chinese company to go to court over their inclusion on the US federal government's list of "military-civil fusions". As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/">Reuters</a>, drone maker DJI and Lidar maker Hesai Technologies sued the Pentagon last year over their designations, though they're still on the list for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
