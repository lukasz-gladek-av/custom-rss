            <p>Not actually a stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> hybrid of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood"> Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief">Thief</a> - although I'd pay good money for that - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodthief">Bloodthief</a> is closer to something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> but also, I think, much better. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941730/Bloodthief_Demo/">Steam demo</a>'s opening levels are roughly as tricky and demanding as the cyberpunk parkour series but, perhaps to due to less concern with being stylish, the movement here feels a lot more caffeinated. You only have to look at the visuals to clock that Bloodthief isn't that sort of game that's precious about letting you do silly things with momentum.</p>
<p>Also you're a vampire, with a sword, exsanguinating armoured knights in a vaguely Germanic medieval town. Well, Vae my Victus. I do get very excited when anything reminds me, even a little, of Blood Omen: Legacy Of Kain. Here's a nice little video of the game in action. Warning: this trailer for the game Bloodthief has blood in it.</p>

<p>Even in the early levels, the way your various movement options chain together starts to get nicely silly. Wall running itself feels a little loose, but an air dash that lets you grapple to enemies while lining up your next slide lets you clear huge distances in seconds. There's, uh, there's also a missile parry but I won't hold that against it (I've reached critical parry mass at this point). Features? Absolutely, yeah. Several:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bloodthief is an ultra-fast melee dungeon-runner where you use momentum to parkour through hazardous dungeons and brutally slash through enemies. Speed-run through medieval dungeons and castles and learn what dark secrets lie beneath the surface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Bloodthief you play as a vampire, and the blood of your foes fuels your abilities and propels you to insane speeds. Movement and combat are deeply intertwined—you’ll need to use both in a beautiful dance of skill and carnage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Levels full of branching paths, shortcuts, and secrets reward those with the skill and creativity to pull them off. Find the perfect path through labyrinthine dungeons and reap the rewards for your efforts.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Matthew (RPS in peace) died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghostrunner-review">1423 times in Ghostrunner</a>. I think I might have doubled that in 20 minutes with Bloodthief's demo, but they are the sort of deaths that make a man a hungry for mastery. Also, Wotsits. But mainly mastery. It's a decent sized demo, too, with six levels. The full game is "coming soon", but you can experience the unbeatable taste of Flamin' Hot Crunchy Wotsits right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> are cooking. I'm not exactly sure what just yet, but there's a faint aroma of a new game in the air, and it doesn't seem like they're ready to share anything about the game right now either. Still, after the runaway success of Helldivers 2, something new from the studio is still an exciting prospect. Interestingly enough though, whatever they're making, it won't have anything to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">PlayStation</a> when it comes to funding.
</p>

<p>
Arrowhead's CEO Shams Jorjani recently shared on Helldivers 2's official Discord (cheers, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">Forbes</a>) that, thanks to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's success, their next game will be fully self-funded. "The wonderful thing is that thanks to the amazing support of you FINE people Arrowhead's future is quite bright and we have the freedom to explore some really cool concepts that we couldn't have otherwise. Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you," wrote Jorjani.
</p>
<p>
After one member of the server asked for whatever said next game is to be available in all regions, Jorjani explained that "the next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." For some context, PlayStation tried to make it so that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">needed a PSN account to play Helldivers 2</a> on PC last year, but that went down so badly they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement</a>. However, that did lead to the game being pulled from sale in a number of countries where PSN isn't available, presumably why the comment was made by said Discord member.
</p>
<p>
To be clear though, it doesn't sound like Arrowhead's relationship with PlayStation has gone sour, as Jorjani said that the company is "great" and that "there would be no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> if it wasn't for them. We're open to working with them again in the future. They are incredibly game/dev oriented. Solid partners. And this is me just saying it like it is. Not blowing smoke up their asses."
</p>
<p>
I'm sure whatever Arrowhead make next will be on PlayStation either way, but that doesn't really matter to us here does it? Personally, it's just nice to know they'll be able to do things their own way, and not lock out a huge number of people from playing a game for such a ridiculously arbitrary reason.
