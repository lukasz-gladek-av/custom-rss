Those seas have plenty to discover and point your cannons at too, especially the "high risk, high reward, and intentionally unforgiving" deep sea region.</p>

<p>As shown off in the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/naval">update rundown</a> from devs Facepunch, the ships you can build as part of this naval update are as bowling shoe ugly as your average early game scrap for resources. Think of the sort of square hunks of metal, wood, and sail that might come out of an episode of Scrapheap Challenge about floating tanks, and you've got the picture.</p>
<p>These tugs are slapped together at deployable boat building stations, fitted out with boaty accoutrements like engines, cannons, and anchors, then cast off in search of plunder. Engine and sail placement factors into your vessel's handling and speed, so maybe don't stick them all at the very back of the deck because you're trying to build the barge version of a Porsche 911. Naturally, you can also install a plank just in case any bickering over loot breaks out among your crew.</p><p>Then, it's heave ho and off you go to the edge of the map, where a new region dubbed the deep sea awaits. "This is not a place to live: you cannot build, and nothing respawns," Facepunch warn. "First come, first served. The deep sea will open and close intermittently, like a world event." Within the bounds of these dangerous waters, you'll find ghost ships protected by hostile scientists and their new turret-equipped PT boats and tropical islands boasting mystery loot. In between battles over goodies, you can drop anchor at ramshackle floating cities "built from abandoned barges and the framework of an unfinished oil rig", where you can restock and hang out at the Deep Deck casino.</p>
<p>It all sounds ripe for piratey antics that build on Rust's well-established scramble for survival among base-building hoarders. The good news is that it's out now and Facepunch have included five new naval missions to get you started.</p>

            <p>Genre soupy shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>'s second big update arrives today, February 6th. It'll deliver a new hero to guard those pesky highs in the form of Ekon, a bloke who can transform into a wolf. Developers Wildlight have also aimed to ensure the game's gang of established heroes don't feel left out by adding a free wolf mount, alongside a new map called Skydrift and a 3v3 ranked mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Ekon doesn’t ride an animal into battle, he becomes one—transforming into a powerful direwolf that tracks, hunts, and runs down mounted enemies," Wildlight wrote of the new hero in the notes for whjat they've dubbed the episode 2 patch. "While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path."</p>
<p>Naturally, his ultimate attack's a big howl that makes opponents scared, with other abilities including a keen sense for foes' heartbeats and the option to send a wolf spirit to track them down. Those all sound like they'll come in handy during 3v3 or 5v5 battles on the Skydrift map, which is comprised of a floating lost city you battle your way up via plenty of bouncing around, zip-lining, and bridge crossing.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Or, you can paw your way into the new ranked mode, which sees you compete to climb a tree of seven titles in 3v3 battles. Wildlight wrote that they've opted to limit this mode to trios because that setup is "the more tactical structure of the game and fits best", but are open to feedback as to whether they've gotten that right.</p><p>Naturally, the higher up the ranking tree you get by the end of each ranked "split" - of which there'll be two per "episode", which looks to be the silly name Wildlight are stick with for periods between major updates - the better rewards you get. On the topic of loot, this patch sees the devs roll out four improvements designed to augment the lootage. These are adding masterwork weapons to the red weapon chests at points of interest, making the barrels that contain ultimate chargers glow, adding waypoint markers to guide you towards location with gear, and ensuring speed gates are permanently powered on.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> has been through a sizeable array of changes since launch in February next year, amid some very uncivilised reactions to boat-rocking features like the new age format. The next update, Test Of Time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-big-test-of-time-update-thatll-bring-back-playing-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-is-set-to-drop-this-spring">will restore the ability to play as one civilization through the whole game</a>, while making changes to how victories are earned in the hope of creating some lategame variety.</p>
<p>All these tweaks and rejigs invite a more fundamental question. “Why didn’t they just launch it as an early access game?” I remember moaning to another journalist last year. I should have directed my moaning at executive producer Dennis Shirk, who says that Firaxis are tentatively open to the idea and, indeed, “jealous” of developers taking this approach.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That’s a snippet from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">an Ars Technica interview</a> this week in which Shirk and franchise creative director Ed Beach look back on the transition from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization VI</a> to Civilization VII, and what they might try with the hypothetical Civilization 8.</p>
<p>One of the major changes with Civilization VI was that Firaxis had access to lot more player telemetry, compared to Civilisation V, rather than monitoring the feedback on Reddit and fansites like CivFanatics. Amongst other things, they discovered that most players don’t finish a single game, which is part of the reason for Civ 7’s more broken-up, modular historical progression.
</p><p>
Based on the reaction to Civ 7, the devs are trying to get hold of that feedback earlier in development of new mechanics or systems. “It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” Beach told the site.</p>
<p>With publisher 2K’s input, the Frankenstein Group is being expanded into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">a larger and more structured playtesting program, the Firaxis Feature Workshop</a>. (I enjoy the implication that a bunch of mad scientists have gone mainstream – I’m picturing Doc Brown, Doctor Octopus and Doctor Eggman at an investor fare, explaining the nutritional benefits of formaldehyde to passing soccer moms.)
</p>
<p>
Officially embracing full early access development (not just preorder-baiting ‘advanced access’) would surely make a lot of sense for Civ, even discounting the ire aimed at Civ 7. After all, even the best 4X strategy games tend to evolve a lot throughout their shelf lives. Ars Technica popped the question, and Shirk had this to say: “It’s one of those things that you can never say never. As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.” 
</p>
<p>
Even so, I doubt it’ll ever happen, because when you present yourself as selling an unfinished game, it’s harder to charge $70 or more for it upfront. Still, perhaps the wilting fortunes of Civ 7 will persuade 2K and Take-Two Interactive to be more calculating with the game's development process.</p><p>Civ 7 set a series record for preorders, but has struggled to match its predecessors in terms of Steam concurrent users. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">Speaking in August last year</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confessed that the game had gotten off to a “slow start” with the caveat that “Civ has always been a slow burn” and “right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.” The publishers have yet to share any total sales figures.
</p>
<p>
The broader question around Civ going early access is whether “early access” really means anything, any more, inasmuch as “early access” has sort of bled into “live service". Most games of a certain scale receive a number of updates post-launch, and players have come to expect them, with a vocal minority pillorying games as “dead” if too many months go past without substantial changes. I think there’s probably a longer feature to write there – do you have any thoughts?
