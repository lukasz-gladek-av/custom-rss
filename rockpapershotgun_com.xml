            <p>It's been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-1">enjoyed quite a bit</a>. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release</a>. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise Of The Ronin</a> this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>"An open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>set in the Bakumatsu period," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/">Steam page</a>, "where players take on the role of a ronin forging their own destiny. The game features multiple possible endings, allowing players to choose which faction to support—such as the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces—which significantly alters the story's outcome."</p>
<p>Here's some exclusive PC-only bits:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>8K resolution support</li>
<li>DirectX 12 Ultimate support</li>
<li>Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility</li>
<li>120fps support</li>
<li>Ray tracing support</li>
<li>3D audio support</li>
<li>Customisable keyboard and mouse controls</li>
<li>AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support</li>
<li>UI menu with mouse click ability</li>
<li>Intel XeSS graphics technology support</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Rise Of The Ronin had a decent reception on release. It's currently sitting at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/rise-of-the-ronin/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5">76 on Metacritic</a>, if that means anything to you. It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG hybrid featuring the typically deep combat you'd expect from Team Ninja. "Hardcore action for the mainstream," reckoned our siblings-in-Ziff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Eurogamer</a>. "It's more grounded than you might expect, all while evolving the Ki-based mechanics first employed in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> for a wider audience".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I reckon you're likely to be in one of two camps with precision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bauhaus-bonk">Bauhaus Bonk</a> - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word "bopping" -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.</p>
<p>There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness">Reefer Madness</a> extra.</p>

<p>"Spin to win in this single-player one-button dexterity game. Can you set a new time record? Complete the level using the fewest spins possible? Secure the global high score? Alternate which pivot-point you’re rotating around to move through 54 levels. Switch the background color to make obstacles disappear. Collect power-ups to speed up, slow down, shapeshift, or phase through obstacles.Reach the goal without hitting a wall"....</p><p>…is all the information we're getting, says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948330/Bauhaus_Bonk/">Steam</a>. How minimalist of you, Bauhaus Bonk. How…unification of individual artistic visions with principles of mass production and an emphasis on function of you, Bauhaus Bonk. No, <em>you </em>just read the Wikipedia page on the Bauhaus movement. Leave me alone. I describe headshots for a living.</p>
<p>Speaking of headshots: Bauhaus Bonk nails some aspects I feel are absolutely crucial - and often overlooked - in games aiming for a similar sense of arcadey snackability. Firstly, when you fail, it absolutely hits like a failure - your spinny stick shattering into myriad pieces. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, you're thrown right back into the restart before you've even really had a chance to process it all. You are thus doomed to play once again, perhaps forever. Bauhaus Bonk is out February 6th, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
