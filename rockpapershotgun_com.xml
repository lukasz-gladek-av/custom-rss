            <p>A former developer on massive Elder Scrolls mod project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> who called its current 2025 release goal "unachievable" has suggested March 2026 as a "fitting" release window for the task of remaking Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine.</p>
<p>Around the time of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">mod's most recent showcase</a>, ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes put out a tweet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">accusing its project lead and implementation lead of rushing the mod out the door</a> to meet a 2025 release goal that Keyes dubbed "pointless and unachievable". The modder also accused the pair of mismanaging the project by not keeping up communication between leads and other developers in terms of key decisions. Keyes' claims and very public split from the Skyblivion team naturally led to questions being asked of the remaining Skyblivion devs, with the mod's comms lead telling fans: "Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking in an interview that'll be arriving in video form on RPS sister site Eurogamer's YouTube channel soon, long-time Skyblivion dev Keyes has now shared more about what he considers a reasonable release timeline for the mod, as well as his reasons for airing his concerns in the very public fashion he did. Asked what he'd consider a reasonable release goal for the mod in terms of avoiding crunch, Keyes said the following:  </p>
<blockquote>Whenever I wanted to delay, I wasn't even thinking of a year. I was thinking of a handful of months [extra]. Personally, I would love to see, this is just me wishing, but I would love to see March 2026 because that would make [it] the 20th anniversary of Oblivion. It'd be a nice fitting release date, I think. That would give an extra three months and that's like gold to us [developers]. So, I definitely feel like early 2026 would be nicer on the developers. But yeah, I'm on the outside now.</blockquote>
<p>Given the strength of the language Keyes used when dismissing 2025 as an ideal release goal, I'm a tad surprised he reckons a few more months would be all it'd take to polish Skyblivion to a satisfactory degree. That said, the dev had made clear he was only pushing for extra polishing time, rather than a longer delay that might lead to feature creep.</p><p>As for whether making the 2025 release goal was something that other Skyblivion devs were worried about, Keyes said: "I think it was definitely a concern a number of people had. Quite a few of them were leads as well, but I noticed that just for some reason, nobody was saying it. It was just more of like sort of a heavy feeling that was surrounding a lot of developers. And I'm always kind of the, for lack of a more elegant term, sometimes a bit of a shit stirrer. If nobody's saying anything, I'm going to try and get people to say something, because I hate miscommunication. It can ruin so many things."</p>
<p>In terms of corner cutting, the dev said his concerns stemmed from the idea that "if we're putting out assets or environments that don't even look as good as Oblivion, we're not living up to the whole point of the project".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Keyes dismissed the official Oblivion Remaster as a factor in any desire to make sure Skyblivion releases in 2025. On the other hand, he suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> is a release that could have consequences for Skyblivion, since it might lead to questions about starting from scratch in that game's engine. Though unless Bethesda suddenly push the big TES VI go button soon, odds are that won't be an issue - in 2023, Microsoft's Phil Spencer estimated that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-announced-five-years-ago-is-still-five-plus-years-away">the next numbered Elder Scrolls won't launch before 2028</a>.</p>
<p>Despite no longer being part of the mod's team, Keyes was also clear that he's hoping its release will go positively, whenever it comes. The modder said he hopes Skyblivion'll avoid major bugs at launch. "I do genuinely believe people are going to absolutely love what they're playing," he continued. "It's going to feel like a very unique thing they're playing because very rarely do you get to play something that's in production for this long. Not because of any development hell, but because they just wanted to take that amount of time to really focus on every detail."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>If indeed Keyes is right to claim that a lack of communication has plagued Skyblivion, here's hoping that its remaining devs can stay on the same page from here on out. The rest of us won't know how much time it ideally needed in the oven until we've got our hands on it, but with a volunteer project that's been in the works this long, I'm crossing my fingers that the modders produce a game that lives up to their own expectations.</p>

            <p>Firaxis and 2K Games are working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update that revamps the game's map generation, while adding a couple of city states and rounding out Napoleon's skillset. It's <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/update-1-2-5-is-loading.699971/">slated to land sometime in the week of September 29th</a>. Why am I writing about it right now? Because senior graphics engineer Ken Pruiksma has just posted a little blog about the intricacies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> map generation that caused Beethoven's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kcOpyM9cBg">Ode To Joy</a> to play tinnily in my head.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a reflection of emotional diarrhea brought on by minor insomnia brought on by a nagging foot injury. Still, there's something... uplifting about the motions of plate tectonics as approximated by computer code. Perhaps you, kind stranger, will be similarly moved.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"When Civilization VII first shipped, the map generation technique we used focused on ensuring balanced play while following some new gameplay rules around things like Deep Ocean and Distant Lands," Pruiksma explains on <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/map-generation/">the game's official site</a>. "This technique, which has its roots in previous Civ games, created fair maps, but also made them predictable." 
</p>
<p>That predictability led to complaints of repetitiveness during Civ 7's exploration phase. Players are also unhappy about "the straight-edged coastlines that could occur between the two major halves" of each map, as Pruiksma goes on. Firaxis are trying to address that in update 1.2.5 with two new map types - "Continents and Islands (two large continents, with islands) and Pangea and Islands (one large continent, with islands)". Both these map types use Voronoi diagrams to grow their landmasses, rather than fractal noise.
</p><p>Being a clueless humanities grad, I won't try to explain Voronoi diagrams - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Wikipedia page</a> calls them "a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects". I'm not qualified to walk you through "fractal noise", either, other than to theatrically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">repeat</a> that it "sounds like a waterfall". Thankfully, Pruiksma jumps straight to explaining the impact of these unsettling math demons on Civilization map generation. 
</p>
<p>Fractal noise, he notes, "works really well when it can be applied uniformly to the whole map. That said, it can be hard to steer towards specific gameplay needs. Voronoi diagrams, on the other hand, give us structure we can build rules on top of, so maps can stay organic while still meeting the gameplay requirements of Civ VII." 
</p>
<p>Now, here's the walkthrough of how the new generator operates that had me hallucinating Beethoven. If you're not into Beethoven, maybe play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJjQj6PkrY">this track from Gorillaz album Demon Days</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Randomly spray a bunch of points onto the map. The more points we spray, the higher the resolution. We'll start low res.</li>
<li>Draw lines around each point dividing them into "cells." You end up with something that looks a bit like cracked glass.</li>
<li>Select some starting cells. These are the seeds of tectonic plates in the game map, similar to the tectonic plates that form our Earth.</li>
<li>Each plate grows, one cell at a time, following some configurable rules, until the whole map is filled. Each plate gets a rotation and movement direction. This is your map's crust, and will be used to help influence the growth of continents later.</li>
<li>Now spray many more dots for a higher resolution version! Draw those lines again to get another shattered-glass look sitting on top of your tectonic plates.</li>
<li>Choose some new starting points for the primary landmasses, and grow them once again following a custom set of configurable rules. These rules can do things like influence landmasses to grow along plate boundaries (especially if they're colliding), avoid the poles, and prefer certain latitudes, just to name a few. This is also where we can apply gameplay-based restrictions, like ensuring Homelands and Distant Lands are separated by a Deep Ocean.</li>
<li>Based on the map's settings, we then grow islands, erode the coastline, add mountains and volcanoes, and perform other finishing touches. Many of these steps involve the same set of generic rules used earlier to determine where features are placed.</li>
<li>Once finished, we overlay the hex grid and then hand the map off to the gameplay layer to determine tile types, Yields, Resources, starting location, and more.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful! I think it's wonderful? I wish devs posted this stuff more often. Ah, remember when "generation" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">used to be a happy, magic word</a>, rather than the harbinger of cost-cutting. 
</p>
<p>We've only got his word for it, but Pruiksma says that the new Voronoi-derived maps appear "far more varied and look much more natural", with oddities or "impossible" features appearing more regularly, such as chains of islands between Homelands and Distant Lands.
</p><p>The tuning of the new generator is designed to produce "natural-feeling maps with standard gameplay" about "95% of the time", he comments, so every 1 in 20 games you might encounter something totally bizarre. If you're concerned about broken terrain, especially in multiplayer games, you'll still be able to play the old map types and generation processes after update 1.2.5.
</p>
<p>Do you have a favourite map or terrain generator in a game of any genre? I have fond memories of certain pre-acquisition eras of Minecraft, when the invisible sandworms hired by Mojang to sculpt the geography would produce huge surface-level caves and giddy rock bridges a couple of pickaxe swings away from being floating islands.
</p><p>
Also yes, regulars who know who they are - this is your cue to once again recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>'s <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/">Vox Populi mod</a> as a vastly superior alternative to Civilization 7, which continues to divide players. I'm not avoiding writing about that mod, I'm just short of time. I never have enough time!</p>
