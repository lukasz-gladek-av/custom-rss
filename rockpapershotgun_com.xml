            <p>Right, put your hands on the table. Please. I won't ask again. Thank you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">arrived on PC</a> as of June 11th, and naturally that's brought a new lease of life the the modding community who'd only had a demo to play with up until that point. Around 40% of the game's mods over on the Nexus right now are a bit risqu√©, so we've done you a favour and picked out the three filthiest on offer.</p>
<p>Don't feel you have to thank us. Well, me. This is all part of the job description, alongside all of the holding power to account and providing a service to the consumer stuff. Odds are my Pulitzer's already in the post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Okay, you ready? Having searched through the 220 Stellar Blade works <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/stellarblade/mods?sort=downloads&amp;adultContent=false">on Nexus Mods</a> as of writing, I isolated the 90 tagged as 'adult', and calculated that those numbers meant the racy, lecherous, and bawdy stuff made up exactly 40.54% of the total. Then, my instincts kicked in. I began a search for the naughtiest of the naughty, the hardcore horniness-inducers. I found three things.</p>
<p>First of all, and promise me you'll remain calm, I found the work of modder WTails358. I present to you, dear reader, their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/11">Casual Wear</a>. As you'll see if you click that link after making sure there are no kids or people with pacemakers nearby, this utterly smutty mod clothes Eve in an incredibly chic autumnal turtleneck-style jumper with a dragon design on it.</p>
<p>That sumptuous garment, which tastefully bares her midriff, is paired with delightfully retro chunky trousers that form the perfect constrast via their bright porcelain hue. Completing the look are a striking aquatically-themed belt buckle in gold, and a pair of understated boots that combine practicality with high fashion. Reader, just breathe, I know your temperature's rising with every word, but you must maintain control.</p>
<p>If you're alright to continue, I'll introduce you to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/60">Formal Wear</a>. Steady now. Take deep breaths. I know, it's an elegant suit and tie combo that allows Eve to cut an equally striking and refined figure that'd look at home on any of the catwalks in Milan or Paris. C'est magnifique, especially twinned with the rounded spectacles that cast Eve as a shrewd, sharp individual who knows what good vintage burgundy tastes like. Phwoar indeed.
</p>
<p>However, you mustn't get carried away, because I have one more totally pornographic mod to show you. It's modder Tenshiken1's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/90?tab=description">Thomas the Tank Engine replacer</a> for the stalker boss. Oh no. You've blown your whistle. You'vre chugged along the tracks and let out a deep, lustful choo-choo. I hope you're proud of yourself. What would Sir Topham Hat think?</p>
<p>Well, at least you've got time to ruminate on your failings and appreciate the non-jiggly things in life while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shift-up-essentially-confirm-stellar-blade-2-is-in-the-works-havent-revealed-how-revealing-it-will-be">more info from Shift Up</a> about Stellar Blade 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature">promised earlier this year</a>, Valve have given Steam developers the power to tag their games as having certain accessibility features, including narrated game menus, ways of differentiating visual elements that don't rely on colour, and touch-only interaction. You'll now be able to search for games with these tags, and view the full list of accessibility features on each game's Steam page.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update is based on feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, according to Valve. Participating devs can make use of the system by means of a software wizard - ah, I find it vaguely comforting that people still call this kind of program a "wizard" - which walks them through each accessibility category. Valve say that "over 5000 applications" have already made use of the new tags.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games," they note <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500575275933763410">in a blog post</a>. "We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>The new accessibility tags are broadly divided into "visual", "audio", "gameplay" and "input". The "gameplay" bracket includes "adjustable difficulty" and "save anytime", while under "visual" we find options like "camera comfort", which lets players "adjust or disable uncomfortable camera movement such as screen shaking, camera bob, or motion blur".</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">full breakdown on Steamworks</a>, including Valve's notes on why each option is important to players.</p>
<p>The selection of taggable features could probably do with some expansion, and the FAQ descriptions themselves are rather brief and broad. When the accessibility tags were announced in April, accessibility-focussed website Can I Play That <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested</a> that Valve should base their system on the existing <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Games Initiative</a>, which aims to standardise accessibility tagging across every game store, to avoid confusing players.</p>
<p>"According to the list in the documentation there is a lot of overlap, and it's mostly Steam that is missing a few tags," Can I Play That wrote. "Steam's version also uses some different names and descriptions. Perhaps most importantly, there also seem to be differences in the criteria."</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad to see this kind of thing from Valve. There's certainly a business case for it, inasmuch as options for players with impaired vision need to be justified in terms of the balance sheet. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.3 billion people worldwide "experience a significant disability". Back in 2023, our James wrote a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">custom and adaptive controllers in particular</a>, discussing how corporate profit motives inevitably limit the options, together with the lingering problem of ableist players perceiving accessibility features as 'cheating'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're desperate for some company of a non-Adoring Fan kind as you run around Cyrodiil in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, odds are the base game'll leave you wanting. Enter a new mod, which adds in a beast master system that'll let you tame a furry or scaly pet.</p>
<p>After all, one could argue you've not really experienced Tamriel unless you're having to stop after every fight to give your precious wild boar Bobo some heal minor wounds-infused tummy tickles</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4468">Beast Master</a> is the mod in question, and the latest example of prolific ColdTyrant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-right-there-oblivion-remastered-modder-imperial-watch-proper-joinable-faction-new-quests-and-a-corruption-system">working to revamp</a> 2025's most 2006 release by giving folks new stuff to try once they've had their fill of shutting spooky doors. </p>
<p>Building on the pretty basic command creature spell from the base game, which Wood Elves have as a racial ability, he's put together a means for you to tame any animal you come across in the wilderness via magic and have it permanently join you on your adventures as a named "combat pet". In addition to being commandable and aiding you in fights like any regular companion, these pets can be fed grub from your inventory and interacted with in order to check on their mood.</p>
<p>That last bit has no impact in gameplay, so the mod's more of the casual pet ownership experience than a full Nintendogs-style furry thing parent simulation that'll leave you feeling even more unnerved than usual about your real life ability to look after actual human children.</p>
<p>Further to that end, you can only have one pet at any given time via the mod, so if you want to replace your tamed Imp named Fatso with a brown bear named Bingus or a troll named Sapphire, you'll have to release the former back into the wild. As of right now, the mod has short lists of pre-defined names and recruitable animals for you to pick from, but ColdTyrant has indicated he's open to adding more options based on suggestions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modder says he initially tried letting folks type in their own custom pet names, but had to ditch that option due to it being "literally impossible to rename an actor without clicking on them directly in the console" at the moment.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this Beast Master mod a go, you‚Äôll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will be updated sometime this month with "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords", but as is often the way of updates, some of the relevant boss files are already in the current version of the game, and yes, there's a mod if you want an early crack at them.</p><!--more-->
<p>From Software teased the coming of spruced-up boss battles in <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">a social media post</a> on 3rd June, offering no clue as to what "enhanced" means in this context. Enhanced movesets? Enhanced haircuts? An inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Subsequently, owl-eared, eagle-eyed players noticed that there were unused sections in every boss soundtrack theme that implied the addition of a third combat phase, together with unused boss relics that look like a reward for besting them in hard mode. Now, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/">PCGamer</a>, NexusMods user TerraMag has dug up the files that let you fight the "enhanced" Nightlords and released them as the obliquely named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92">Enhanced Nightlord Fights mod</a>.</p>
<p>If you lack the fortitude to face these maxed-out titans yourself, or you just want to chill to footage of an apoplectic gigaroach, TerraMag has kindly released some videos of the enhanced fights. Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't the final, From-sanctioned versions of each enhanced boss, so they might appear rough and unfinished. </p>

<p>TerraMag has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY_1VCfCjWg">harsh words for Adel, Baron of Night in one video description</a>, complaining that "this fucker REFUSED to do any normal bite moves to let me show off the new effect on it". Well, perhaps that's because you woke Adel's phase 3 incarnation up before the appointed time, guy. I'm not much of a morning person myself. Don't ask me to bite anybody before I've had my second coffee.</p>
