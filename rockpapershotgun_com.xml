            <p>When you shoot your beginner pistol in action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-clock">Hell Clock</a>, it feels like someone slapped the foundations of the catacombs you're standing in with a pork chop big enough to decapitate god. There is beefy gun feel, and there is this: a gun chutney so chunksome and tactile I had to check my mouse hadn't suddenly sprouted haptics. As a single player, single class genre entrant, it's not quite fair to compare it to more sprawling mainstays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>. But I woke up feeling unfair today: even in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/">its demo form</a>, I'd much rather play Hell Clock than either of them.</p>

<p>In 1897, the near entirety of the Brazilian municipality of Canudos's 25,000 inhabitants were massacred by heavy artillery bombardments, after successfully repelling three previous assaults from government forces. That's a very truncated account, and you can <a href="https://www.aaihs.org/state-violence-and-the-canudos-massacre-in-brazil/">learn more here</a>, but that's the setting that Brazilian studio Rogue Snail (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/relic-hunters-zero">Relic Hunters</a> series) are folklore-ifying and undead-itising here. You play as gunslinger Pajeú, slinging his way gun-fully through dungeons to rescue the soul of his mentor The Counselor.</p>
<p>There's plenty here that'll be immediately familiar to dedicated ARPeGgios, but there's also a good dose of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> and other action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> (lites). You blast mobs with hotkey commands, building mana with one kind of bullet, then spending it on other, better bullets. You gulp down potions. You dodge with space (it hurts enemies though!). You collect shiny loot and…</p>
<p>Wait, but you actually <em>don't</em> collect shiny loot. And even if you did, you'd lose it after your run anyway. Instead, you collect purple crystals to spend on permanent gear and abilities between runs. Everything else - gold, ability buffs,   - is temporary. There's another wrinkle, too. Each run has a time limit of 20 minutes, although there is a 'relaxed mode' option to disable this, and it does pause during boss fights.</p>
<p>Here are some lovely bullet point features from Steam. Actually, I added the bullet points. Wouldn't want to misquote Steam. SEGA once misquoted a review I wrote of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 in which I said I'd be "hesitant to call Warhammer III a landmark strategy game in its own right". "A landmark strategy game in its own right" - The Guardian. Utterly shameless. Here's the fact-me-doos:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>RACE AGAINST TIME</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every second counts as you battle the undead forces of your oppressors. Risk delving deeper for powerful loot and face the nightmarish incarnations of those who sought to bury the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FORGE UNSTOPPABLE BUILDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hunt down ancient Relics infused with the strength of resistance. Create devastating combinations that channel Canudos's unbreakable spirit into unstoppable power.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNLEASH HELLISH POWER</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Master a diverse selection of devastating abilities born from righteous fury. Dance through hordes with lightning-fast knife strikes, smash enemies with Canudos' great bell, or rain rapid-fire death from your trusty sidearm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REWRITE HISTORY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each descent brings new chances to right historical wrongs. Discover unique combinations of Blessings to evolve your build as you face the demons of Brazil's dark past, present, and future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIGHT AT YOUR OWN PACE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you seek a brutal test against history's oppressors or a thoughtful journey of justice, Hell Clock adapts to your path. Remove all time pressure with Relaxed Mode, or push your limits in Hardcore mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VENGEANCE NEVER ENDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Experience a complete three-act story campaign, then test your perfectly tuned builds in the challenging Endgame, where your gear, abilities, and playstyle are pushed to their limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're a sicko for the long term grind, build theorycrafting, and the like, then sure - it's far too early to say whether Hell Clock can compete with its behemoth genre mates. But in terms of just, like, having fun with a videogame - yeah, this is the only ARPG I'm interested in playing right now. It's due out "Q2" of this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In every round of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a>, you’re dragged gasping from a cryo-coffin and dropped into the bowels of an enormous laboratory by a horrible pincer-crane. Reaching your appointed floor, you’re asked to hack terminals and reach waypoints while trying not to rouse a sleeping population of mutants. It’s a terrible fate, but as your turrets run out of bullets and the bipedal lampreys overwhelm your friends, you can take consolation in the knowledge that there are no microtransactions - for when 10 Chambers launched the early access version in 2019, they promised to release all DLC for free. “There but for the grace of God go I,” you can say, thinking with a shudder of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, while the Shadows tear your head from your body. 
</p>
<p>
No such consolation awaits players of 10 Chambers’ forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/den-of-wolves">Den of Wolves</a>, a cyberpunk co-op heist shooter in the tradition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>. According to audio director Simon Viklund , the game will “most likely” have microtransactions, for the simple reason that the studio is now 10 times bigger than when they launched GTFO, and needs to make more money. Don’t be entirely depressed, however – there will be no “maths-fuckery”, no pay to win, and no “buckazoids”.

<p>
“The way we launched GTFO - you pay for it once, and you have the whole game - that was a viable business approach for when we were nine members of staff,” Viklund told <a href="https://www.vg247.com/den-of-wolves-mtx-dlc-interview-simon-viklund">VG247</a> in a recent interview. “But now we’re 100 people, the burn rate is way bigger, and Den of Wolves is a much more ambitious game. So we’re hoping it turns into a live service type thing.”
</p>
<p>
("Burn rate" is the speed at which a company depletes its cash reserves when it’s losing money.)
</p>
<p>
Lest the mention of "live service" give you hives, keep reading. “It’s not going to be a subscription service, it’s going to be a premium price,” Viklund qualified. “Maybe two-thirds of what triple-A games usually cost. So it’s more in the level of GTFO, the Payday games, and Vermintide – those other first-person co-op games. That’s the space we’re occupying.
</p>
<p>
“So, yes, there will be microtransactions, most likely,” he said. “There will be DLC, but nothing that is pay-to-win, nothing that is math-fuckery where, you know, for 20 bucks you buy 100 buckazoids and then everything you can buy in the game costs 64 buckazoids, so you can never ever get rid of all your buckazoids, so you always have that splinter in your mind telling you: ‘I’m leaving money on the table in this game, I need to buy more buckazoids’. It’s manipulative, stuff like that.”
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Viklund clarified that the game won’t have an in-game currency – if you buy things it’ll be with real money – and there won’t be any randomised lootbox-style elements to get the ratings agencies in a tizz about whether this is literally gambling. People who buy stuff like DLC maps will be able to host friends who haven’t bought that DLC. There are also some interesting allusions to how the microtransactions might form part of the game’s darknet underworld stylings. Please don’t suddenly reveal that this is a cryptocurrency game, 10 Chambers.
</p>
<p>
We missed the chance to go see Den Of Wolves recently because RPS does not, despite much zesty correspondence with management, have access to a cryogenic warehouse full of deployable drone agents. We must conserve our cannon fodder for press events so grandiose you can see them from space. Still - as and when Graham’s horrible hell-pincer selects me for preview build duties, I’m looking forward to playing it.

            <p>The folks who made roleplaying musical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical">Stray Gods</a> have announced they're working on a new arcane deckbuilder in which you play a "former priest turned exorcist and demon hunter". The game is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> and (as with the studio's previous game) it's being led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, which probably means a bunch of magical sarcasm and harrowing deaths. It's very early days though - the game hasn't yet launched a planned Kickstarter.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's a bit of description from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/summerfallstudios/malys-exorcise-demons-on-your-hunt-for-an-ancient-evil">that Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>"The city teems with demons, and among them lies your prey: Malys, a demon of extraordinary cunning and power. Use your deck to expose the rot within. Find unique combinations and strategies to withstand the horrors. Help the hopeless and free the possessed, or die in the attempt… over and over again."</blockquote>
<p>And that's really all we've got to go on for now, apart from the promise that the game will be "pushing the boundaries of roguelite storytelling and delivering a satisfyingly moody experience". You might hope so, with a narrative lead as experienced as this. Gaider, was lead writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a> but left BioWare in 2016 to work elsewhere, before finally setting up a new company, Summerfall Studios. </p>
<p>Malys seems quite different to the studio's first game. Stray Gods was a branching single player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> about the Greek gods trying to exist in a modern US city, but with singing. Every scene would eventually see its cast burst into song, harmonising in a sometimes combative, sometimes cooperative manner. Then you could choose what lyrics to sing next, and in what style. It also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orpheus-may-be-missing-from-hades-2-but-hes-returning-to-role-playing-musical-stray-gods">some DLC featuring OG sad boy Orpheus</a> a year after release. </p>
<p>"Stray Gods handles big emotions and epic poem tragedies with a dignified touch," said Jon Bailes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-gods-the-roleplaying-musical-review">our review of the mythical musical</a>, "then shimmies back to mischief and humour like an especially supple salsa dancer." It's true. I played it on a weekend whim and liked it, although I agree with our review that there was more than a whiff of Whedon in its quippiness. </p>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for Malys and whether or not it hits its crowdfunding target. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The most influential game of all time is Yu Suzuki's 1999 proto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> Gashapon 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, according to a public poll held by BAFTA. To claim that top spot in the top five, it beat out Doom, Super Mario Bros, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a>, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>Minecraft hovered around the winners table laughing loudly at everyone's jokes at number six. At number 11, Tetris had to sit on a bin because all the chairs had been taken. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> paced up and down the corridor complaining that everyone had nicked its outfit idea in 18th place, tailed in 19th by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> 3. Full results below in descending order.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Henry has come to see us - riding atop a muzzled Super Mario 64, no less - Polygon's Oli Welsh <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/550231/shenmue-bafta-most-influential-game-all-time">reckons its evidence</a> of "brigading among passionate game fans," and, yep, sounds about right. I'm not sure KCD 2 has been out long enough to influence anything outside its own DLC. Baldur's Gate 3 at 16 is also a weird one. It's that big number '3' that gives it away.</p>
<p>As for Shenmue, I can see it, even if I'm not sure it would have been my pick. I've long held that Yakuza 0 is, within a certain console tradition of RPG-tinted action adventures, the most and possibly best example of its kind ever made, and that's a lineage you can trace directly back to Shenmue, not least for Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi's own involvement in the 1999 game. Less subjectively, Shenmue's NPC and simulation elements were a big deal for the time, especially for console. "The game popularised the use of Quick Time Events (QTEs)," BAFTA say.</p>
<p>That might not be something to celebrate for some of you, but I'm just going to say it: I like QTEs. I remember first properly encountering them in Resident Evil 4 and excitedly telling a mate "it's like a cutscene, but you can die if you don't press the right buttons!". Then again, I'm also a fan of Dragon's Lair and old adventure games that killed you every five minutes in different ways like 1998's X-Files. Bring back annoying deaths as a form of collectible, I say.</p>
<p>"I am deeply honoured and grateful that Shenmue has been selected as the Most Influential Video Game of All Time," said Yu Suzuki. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, “How real can a game become?”, aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail. This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement".</p>
<p>If you got the chance to crowbar one game on to BAFTA's list and no-one could do anything about it, what would it be? Me? I'm still waiting for the world to catch up and recognise the importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Spot">Cool Spot</a>. Never has a game influenced so many to say, sure, I'll have a 7UP if literally nothing else is available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
