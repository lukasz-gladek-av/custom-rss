            <p>
It's been a while since we've last seen anything FIFA in the world of video games, namely because EA took a gamble on saying goodbye to the sports association's official licence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-officially-ditch-fifa-and-will-rename-the-series-ea-sports-fc-from-next-year">back in 2022</a>. Whether that has paid off, literally, is neither here nor there right now though, as FIFA announced this week that it has signed a "multi-year partnership" with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager</a>, once again bringing its recognisable (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32897066">if potentially tainted</a>) name back to video games.
</p>
<p>
Well, technically this is the second FIFA game connection since the EA split, seeing as earlier this month it also revealed <a href="https://youtu.be/qKWU52Et1ww?si=CDiUYE_OJLJ0nC8I">FIFA Heroes</a>, but that one's just for phones so we can ignore it for now. In any case, this particular deal sounds like it will go into effect pretty soon, as there'll be official licences for things like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fifa-world">FIFA World</a> Cup, the Women's World Cup, and Club World Cup.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-and-fifa-sign-multi-year-partnership">blog post</a>, all this FIFA stuff will be coming as part of a "playable, revamped International Management module," coming to Football Manager 2026 sometime next year, ahead of the World Cup itself - that kicks off (pun intended) the middle of June, so this update will at least be out in the first half of the year. Said blog post also notes that kits for all 48 of the participating teams in the world cup will be included, as well as some broadcast graphics and tournament branding.
</p>
<p>
Is any of this particularly necessary? Probably not, but it does show that FIFA is still quite interested in having a games presence. Time will tell if that recent, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">internally controversial</a>, private <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buyout of EA</a> will see EA Sports FC get its old name back.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2026-will-be-coming-home-soon-enough-with-a-november-release-date">due out next month</a> on February 4th.

            <p>
Like whatever genres you like, but for me personally, I find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformers</a> to be the quintessential video game genre. Even with the most challenging entries, there are very few other genres that (when done well) are as easy and quick to pick up, play, and have fun with. I think that's why so many of them have such longevity, one such game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/n">N++</a>, a tough but fair platformer that's celebrating its 10th anniversary with a new update.
</p>
<p>
Available now and appropriately titled TEN++ (as if there was any other choice), it's quite a simple update: more game! Which translates to more levels across the game's solo, co-op, and race modes. For solo there's two new level sets, titled "?!" and "!?" respectively, with co-op and race getting one level set each, both titled TEN++. In a trailer announcing the update, developer Metanet Software said that there's "no way anyone 100%'s it… for real this time!"
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/2025/celebrating-10-years-of-nplusplus">blog post</a>, the devs got a bit candid about working on N++ too, saying that "by 2018, we were very burned out, having worked tirelessly on N++ over 6 years. We took a little break - but the thing is, we always come back to making levels. Those of you who have tried it may understand; it’s just fun to do, and somehow there are always new ideas to be uncovered." Subsequently, over the years, they've kept making more levels, having "rediscovered what is so special about this game," thanking the game's community for its enthusiasm in helping them do so.
</p><p>
Oh, and there's another bit of good news too: Metanet Software have started development on their next game. They're keeping quiet about it for now, but you can <a href="https://www.metanetsoftware.com/newgame">sign up to hear about it</a> (and potentially play its beta) further down the line.
</p>
<p>
And if you've never played it before, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/">it's currently less than three quid on Steam</a>, an offer that's hard to turn your nose up at.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> is honestly not a game I expected to still be going for as long as and as strongly as it has. It came out in 2022! That was practically a decade ago, at least in games industry years, and yet here is developer Massive Monster showing off the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> next big expansion, Woolhaven. There's no release date other than an early 2026 release window, but a new trailer did at least show off all of that farming you'll get to do. Or, I guess get your cult to do.
</p>
<p>
The big theme for this expansion, as you may have gathered from the name already, is winter, that pesky incoming season those of us in England will inevitably complain about after having complained about the heat all summer. This particular trailer hones in on the new ranch and the steps you can take to deal with cold, harsh weather that stops your crops from growing as well.

<p>
Namely, you can raise animals, which includes things that look like goats, cows, crabs, snails, turtles. You can raise them from birth, breed them, even name them, and after all that you can shear them for some resources, or carve them up for Sunday dinner. Makes naming them just a little bit more difficult, but this is a game where you run a cult, if you take issue with slaughtering an animal for sustenance and not that, I would have questions.
</p><p>
You do also need to make sure they get fed, cleaned, protected from predators too, and there's the option to take them on a walk or ride on them. Over time and levels you can get your followers to attend to these duties, or even get a best animal friend of their own. This part I find quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
Like many sim games of its ilk, the ultimate goal is automation. Take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a game where given enough time, you'll get to a point where you don't even need to tend to your own crops anymore, freeing up your time for more leisurely activities or even bits of story.
</p>
<p>
Woolhaven comes with a couple of new dungeons, so I imagine this loop of building up your ranch as you go on more adventures works similarly to the rest of the game. But I am curious to see if there's any kind of direct commentary on the ever popular, and ever growing, farming sim genre, seeing as you have a whole cult to dictate.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's apparently more reveals to come for Woolhaven, but in the meantime you can look forward to playing it early 2026.
