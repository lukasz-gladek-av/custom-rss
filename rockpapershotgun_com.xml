            <p>Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, the saying goes. (This is why so many games journalists are unemployed - ba-dum tish.) Thankyfully the next expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> seems to understand the permeable boundary between passion project and career as purely aspirational. It's called Businesses &amp; Hobbies and it lets Sims open their own tattoo parlour, pottery studio or - if you have the right complementary expansion - a cat café.

<p>Expansion packs are the largest of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> various DLC types, adding both new content and new mechanics, and Businesses &amp; Hobbies seems pretty rich. Your new businesses can offer a range of services, from classes to products to services like tattooing, with players able to tweak pricing, hire staff, and denote areas of shops that are accessible to staff only.
</p>
<p>Within that template, there's seemingly a lot of detail been added to the new skills. Tattooing, for example, will let you design your own custom designs, drawing on the skin of your Sims or using clipart-style shapes. You'll need your Sim to get gradually better at the skill if they're going to have happy customers, though, and there's a new mentorship system that allows your Sim to learn from existing experts in the field.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the aspirational element I referenced above, the expansion also adds two new cities, at least one of which looks to be somewhat inspired by Copenhagen, here rendered as "Nordhaven". Northern European countries seem like the sort of place where owning a successful small business or pursuing a creatively fulfilling careers might still be possible.
</p>
<p>I referenced cat cafés as one potential small business, but it's worth noting that this particular flavour of business is only available if you also own the previous Cats And Dogs expansion. There are several other previous expansions that can function alongside this new one, letting you open an acting school (Get Famous expansion), a spa (Spa Day Game Pack), or a laundromat (Laundry Day stufff pack). All of the details of complementary DLC <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/businesses-and-hobbies-expansion-pack">are listed in the announcement on The Sims site</a>.
</p>
<p>The Sims 4's Businesses &amp; Hobbies expansion pack will launch on March 6th. In the meantime why not check out our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4-best-packs-guide-all-dlc-packs-explained">best Sims 4 expansions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Answering GDC's 2023 survey, 78% of respondents said they considered the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/91-of-game-developer-survey-respondents-say-abuse-from-players-is-a-problem/">harassment and toxicity </a>developers receive from the public to be a serious issue. A simple sentiment is often the most effective, and the title of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> veteran Mark Darrah's <a href="https://youtu.be/0mkVfdbVAZE">latest video</a> cuts right to the heart of it: "Your $70 doesn't buy you cruelty."</p>
<p>You don't have to like a game, and you don't have stay quiet if you have complaints, says Darrah. You're entitled to be angry, and you're entitled to express that anger. "If you are mad at that Ubisoft game, be mad at Ubisoft," he says. "Express your anger to Ubisoft or the studio that made the game. But you cross a line when you start being cruel about it." (Thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mass-effect/bioware-veteran-calls-out-the-cruelty-of-fans-celebrating-layoffs-you-are-crossing-a-line-and-youre-probably-attacking-the-wrong-person-anyway/">PC Gamer </a>and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-and-anthem-producer-says-stop-harassing-developers-because-you-dont-know-the-circumstances-that-resulted-in-the-thing-that-youre-mad-at/">GamesRadar</a>)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"When you celebrate layoffs at a studio because the game that you don't like didn't do that well, you're crossing a line into being cruel, and fundamentally, you should have more grace for other human beings," Darrah says. "But if you're not buying that, let's go on to point two: you don't know what caused the results you don't like."</p>
<p>Mark Darrah! Are you suggesting to the internet that booting up a game doesn't instantly bestow you with a flawless grasp of development's every nuance like <a href="https://youtu.be/6vMO3XmNXe4">Neo learning Kung Fu</a>? I'd call it a dangerous play, but since you've already suggested commenters try a little basic empathy, I can only assume your tolerance for having bile slung at you is ironclad.</p>
<p>He gives an example of the sort of circumstances that might lead to issues. "Say you don't like the line delivery on a piece of dialogue. Is that the fault of the voice actor? It might be, but it could be a lot of other things". It might be the fault of the person directing them, he says. Maybe the writer gave specific stage directions, or the recording equipment went down and they were stuck with an imperfect take. Or maybe the writer themselves was under pressure from crunch.</p>
<p>"Maybe the direction of the game changed radically three months ago, and they had to rewrite this entire character in just three months," Darrah continues, which might well be an example plucked from experience. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which Darrah consulted on and has attracted a wave of the sort of ire he's calling out here, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">began life as a live service game</a>.</p>
<p>He gives several other examples of the sort of circumstances that can lead to perceived or real issues with quality, but the message is both clear and rings true: game development is complicated, and problems can occur at every level and cause ripple effects. It's also true that more public facing professionals often suffer the worst harassment, and for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">issues that are largely beyond their control</a>. None of which means that players should simply shut up about games that don't meet their hopes, but there's a line between proportionate feedback aimed at the company as a whole and just shitting on random designers over social media: especially when you're celebrating job losses.</p>
<p>"Express your opinion to the company that made your game. Tell them what you like, tell them what you don't like. Be specific. It will help you get games that are more like what you want. But when you are personally attacking individual devs, you are crossing a line, and you're probably attacking the wrong person anyway."</p>
<p>I'm concerned here that Darrah's words will not so much fall on deaf ears as ears deliberately chopped off by their owners. Call me cynical, but I don't think the sort of person who goes online to harass developers, writers, or actors is just one realisation away from stopping - whether that realisation is about the material or hierarchical realities of development, or simply the emotional toll the avalanche of abuse can take on their targets.</p>
<p>Still, if anything is likely to engender some empathy, developers speaking candidly about the realities of their work would be it, so hats off to Mark Darrah for speaking about this publicly. Just don't read the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>On HBO and Sky, respectively</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've known that HBO's Last Of Us adaptation was getting a second season <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-getting-a-second-season">since 2023</a>, but now it has a release date. The first episode will air in the US on April 13th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Season two is set five years after the first series, and is due to partially cover the events of the second game, The Last Of Us: Part Two. That's "partially" because the show's creators have suggested it will take several seasons to tell that story in full.
</p>
<p>UK viewers will be able to begin season two the day after its US broadcast when the first episode is shown on Sky and streaming service NOW on Monday, April 14th.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us: Part Two</a> is also due to arrive on PC in lightly remastered form on April 3rd. It'll be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">via Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>The first season of HBO's adaptation was critically acclaimed, and became the first video game adaptation to be nominated for several awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">such as the Emmy's</a>. It stuck closely to the plot of the original game, with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>I loved showrunner Craig Mazin's previous prestige series Chernobyl, but I confess I have very little appetite to watch The Last Of Us. It's a grim tale, and while that's arguably offset by the satisfaction of the interactions in the game, I can't imagine passively watching it without becoming deeply depressed. This is not a criticism of the show, mind you, merely an admission that I'm a softhearted babyman. I'll be watching old-fashioned cosy crime show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26591110/">Elsbeth</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
