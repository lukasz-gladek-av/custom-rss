            <p>Ring ring. Ring Ring. Ring ring. The stern and bespectacled manager of Blake Manor's hotel appears for the eighth time. You're looking a bit narked there mate, I, the investigatorman, observe. Yes, he says yet again, I'm a bit stressed and busy on account of our telegram machine having gone kaput. Makes sense, I reply, can't think of any other reasons why you might be pissed off. He shuffles back into his office for exactly five seconds. Ring ring.</p>
<p>You're being haunted in the demo for spooky detective puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a>, which released in full earlier this week, having had a demo up on Steam for a good while. However, I can confirm having taken in the first night of that demo that you're also give the power to do the haunting yourself.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me as the intro sequence played were the Dracula vibes. You're not off to Transylvania, but the year is 1897 and private investigator Declan Ward is on his way to a remote manor in Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. He sits in a carriage examining the letter sent to him by an anonymous client, his brow furrowing in the way that only the brows of gothic horror protagonists can furrow.</p><p>He arrives at the manor and is greeted by pale stone walls amid a thunderstorm, because spooky tales like this are contractually obligated to lean into moody weather whenever possible. I jest, as for all its conventionality, the bit of Séance of Blake Manor I've played is a beautifully rendered and assembled love letter to classic spookage. Your first task is to work out whether the girl you're seeking, Evelyn Deane, has actually left the building.</p>
<p>To get there, you'll need to examine objects, quiz people, and gradually string together enough evidence to put together a hypothesis. Think something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>, but a bit less unorthodox in terms of styling. Signs up hint that a séance is being hosted at the hotel and I'm sure neither that nor the ghostly figures I keep seeing hint at anything remotely concerning going on round these parts.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've distracted myself by relentlessly pressing the hotel desk bell to summon the manager. I need to get a move on, because each little bit of investigating takes time off the clock, and you only get an hour of in-game time to solve this first mystery. Fine, I guess I'll do something useful and ask him about the creepy statue outside this time. Ring Ring.</p>

            <p>
It is more than commonplace these days for games to get some kind of delay, in fact it's surprising when the big boy names don't get one, like, say, GTA 6, which was meant to be out this year, but got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">pushed to 2026</a>. But it's rare that most games take more than 13 years to develop, an amount of time which retrofuture moonbase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> did in fact take. Except now its release is right around the corner!
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes, I know, you'll believe it when you see it, but as it currently stands developer Lunar Software says that the game is slated for release this coming December 4th. That's just over a month away, as long as the way calendars work hasn't changed since I started writing this, a closeness that would make it surprising if the game received further delays. So, perhaps you'll be able to actually experience the game for yourself by the end of the year!

<p>
If you've not heard of Routine before, it's one of those survival horror games, one where you explore an abandoned moonbase. There's mysterious, quite creepy robots that want to kill you (of course!), puzzles to solve (of course), and an aesthetic based around the idea of what the future might have looked like from an '80s perspective (of course?).
</p><p>
It took so long to make in part because the devs simply couldn't work on it for a while, both for financial reasons and a general unhappiness with where it was going. Routine did get a re-reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retrofuturistic-moonbase-horror-game-routine-is-actually-still-coming">back in 2022</a>, now with added support from publisher Raw Fury, with a couple of engine changes mixed in somewhere amongst the decade and a bit development period.
</p>
<p>
Doom 2016 composer Mick Gordon also worked on the soundtrack, but he did leave the project in 2024 due to scheduling issues - a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/582778112589168937?l=english">recent Q&amp;A</a> explained that since that point the audio and audio implementation is being handled by "other people."
</p>
<p>
I do quite vibe with the aesthetic Routine offers up, I have quite a distaste for that clean, shiny look you see so much of in sci-fi these days, and retrofuturism always has that bit of texture I crave. But, well, it did take 13 years to make, so I have some reservations! Good thing I only learned about it from the re-reveal, so I don't have those 13 years of expectations like some of you might. On that note, good luck, Lunar Software!

If you miss the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as much as you do the mottled grass textures of Hyrule Field, you will perhaps enjoy Mouseward, which is available now in pre-alpha form. It's a "soulslike collectathon" from the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-sols">Void Sols</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/void-sols-is-an-atmospheric-and-highly-customisable-soulslike-for-people-who-are-rubbish-at-soulslikes">found to be</a> "an atmospheric and highly customisable Soulslike for people who are rubbish at Soulslikes". Mouseward seems similarly forgiving, for all its grim talk of death being "a lesson, not an end".

<p>
Yes, enemies respawn when you perish, but you get to keep all your accumulated progression points and spend them right away at the most recent campfire, care of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-style astral level-up menu. Yes, the world looks a bit like Anor Londo, nested at the bottom of a well of Erdtrees, but it also looks like one of those N64 games you played, decades before you were exposed to the hellish clockwork of "deliberate, stamina-based combat". The visuals are at once chubby and cadaverous, like a mix of Ocarina of Time and Medieval. Here's a trailer.

The premise is that a "calamitous starfall" has brought a kingdom to ruin. You are a rodent Chosen Undead, rising from your grave to mend the world by tracking down every last scattered piece of star. Along the way, there will be blocking, backstabbing, archers, ambushes, secret entrances, plunging attacks, and melancholy, murderous badgers. In precisely that order, in fact.</p><p>I've just finished the opening bonfire loop in the pre-alpha, and I soulslike this a lot. Simple, tight controls, good atmosphere, and the enticing sense of a developer taking a genre back to formula - and possibly taking it somewhere new, once the tutorial segments are past. I'm interested to discover how the Fromsoft template might have to shapeshift to accommodate the collectathon focus and nods to fifth generation console action-platformers. Anyway, <a href="https://finite-reflection.itch.io/mouseward">you can find that Mouseward pre-alpha on Itch.io</a>. The game also has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188410/Mouseward/">Steam page</a>.

            <p>In their first set of financial results since <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/control-studio-remedy-issues-profit-warning-due-to-weak-sales-of-fbc-firebreak/">issuing a profit warning</a> and switching CEOs earlier this month, Remedy have revealed that they're moving resources away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> amid a "sense of urgency", and aiming to rely on established series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Control delivering hits which'll shore up their commercial fortunes in the long-term.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In these <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf">latest financial results</a>, Remedy reported a loss of €16.4 million between July and September 2025, in contrast to the €2.4 million profit it made the same time last year, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> had been out of the door less than a year. Remedy co-founder Markus Mäki - who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-after-nine-years">stepped into the role of interim CEO</a> last week, replacing former CEO Tero Virtala not long after Firebreak's sales disappointment - says his job's been "to raise the bar and the sense of urgency across the organization, and to drive stronger results".</p>
<p>So, given Firebreak's sales have only gone up "marginally" as the studio have delivered updates, they're unsurprisingly shifting chess pieces elsewhere. "We continue working on features which enhance player value, and which are justified by our updated long-term sales expectations," the results doc reads. "We have moved development resources to our other in-development titles while respecting our communicated roadmap for FBC: Firebreak."</p>
<p>As for what the studio are banking on to arrest their number slumpage, Mäki says they plan on making big hit games that people like. More concretely, he indicated Remedy's focus in the short-term and until 2030 is mainly to lean on their established series, Alan Wake and Control, to keep growing and deliver these hits. Though, the fact the studio'll be "carefully balancing our product risk" with the need to create "new experiences" suggests future spin-offs being relied on as hits probably won't be as big a leaps into the unknown as Firebreak was, being Remedy's first crack at multiplayer.</p><p>For now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> being developed alongside Rockstar remain in the works. There's also an unnamed new project listed as being in the proof of concept stages at Remedy. Given the emphasis on their plan to rely on Control and Alan Wake, as well as need to stick to proveable hits, it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to imagine it could be something Wake-ish. Don't quote me on that though, we'll have to wait and see whenever this mysterious thing's revealed.</p>
