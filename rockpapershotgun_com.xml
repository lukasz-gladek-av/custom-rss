            <p>Happy Mawday all! This week, I'm thinking about how we can expand our bestiary of Maw manifestations. When describing the beast, we often resort to stock Lovecraftian imagery of a kaleidoscopic kerfuffle of teeth and tentacles, but the Maw’s appearances aren’t always so pulpy and cinematic. Sometimes, it just looks like a blinking cursor, or an expectant child, or a feeling of guilt about not returning a text message from an old friend. Sometimes, it looks like an audience of people who want to read about new PC games. 
</p>
<p>Come, depress yourself with me as we tot up possible indicators of Maw activity. Alternatively, read about some of those aforesaid new PC games. Thanks very much to Editor King Julian for suggesting the majority of titles on this list, which he has been doing with disturbing efficiency of late. 
</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 12th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221480/Big_Hops/">Big Hops</a> is a 3D platformer featuring a frog who is given to both the titular big hops and also, tongue-based gymnastics. I guess Big Tongue would have sent the wrong signals as a title.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797960/Confidential_Killings__A_Detective_Game/">Confidential Killings - A Detective Game</a> is definitely a game that could have done with a better title. You might as well call Mass Effect “Space Shootings &amp; Shaggings – An RPG”. Oh no, I think I’ve just talked myself into this.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quarantine-zone-the-last-check">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</a> is a game about playing a border guard during a zombie apocalypse that has the strong potential to be either a Papers, Please-style moral experiment or a crass and gaudy fantasy about brutalising migrants, and is perhaps worth us writing about in either case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 13th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Out this week in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is the previously Riot Games-published sandbox building RPG, now in the hands of the Minecraft Hypixel server founders at Hypixel Studios. This could be Big, though I’m not sure the world needs another cousin of Minecraft with Robloxy game creation platform aspirations.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937880/Hank_Drowning_On_Dry_Land/">Hank: Drowning on Dry Land</a> (pictured) is a caped debacle in which you play drunk, time-travelling pseudo-Batman trying to escape from a comicbook world. Julian picked this one out in our morning meeting for being a budget experimental immersive sim, akin to Blendo’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 14th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fez fans ahoy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</a> is an action RPG puzzler in which you can spin the world to reveal things or remove them from existence. I like the old school Nintendo handheld visuals and the guiding meditation on object permanence.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707870/Streetdog_BMX/">Streetdog BMX</a> is six colourful 3D maps' worth of kids doing frightfully Tony Hawkish things on bicycles. Seriously, how do any of these mad children still have groins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 15th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> is the thirteenth instalment in an apparently brilliant RPG series I am resigned to never being able to play before the sun implodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3538860/Tabulo/">Tabulo</a> is the latest Balatro-like, which is to say, the latest snazzy application of roguelite mechanics to a concept that was getting on quite well enough without - in this case, chess</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">Craftlings</a> is… Lemmings, the ancient Psygnosis game in which you try stop critters walking off clifftops, but it’s also a colony building sim, with mines and airships and monsters? This is a truly terrifying piece of retro alchemy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 16th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459150/The_Fortress/">The Fortress</a> is a first-person turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG in the tradition of Eye of the Beholder and Legend of Grimrock. You’ve been locked up by the Sorceror King. Please attempt to get out.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973060/NEUROXUS/">NEUROXUS</a> is a dizzy third-person mech shooter that looks like Armored Core 6 but more neon.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525060/Moving_Simulator/">Moving Simulator</a> is, as you may deduce, a moving house simulator, though I guess that could also be “moving” as in emotive. Perhaps it’s both? Moving house tends to be pretty moving.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2547090/Lunar_Ascendant/">Lunar Ascendant</a> is about playing politics as the very first mayor of the Moon. You will monitor social media, bandy words with representatives of various factions, and figure out your relationship to an Earth now run by super-advanced AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things afoot this week: James and Julian have some preview events to attend. Mark and Ollie are gunning for a bit of that Hytale launch excitement, among other things, and I’m trying to turn around a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> review, after only getting code on Friday.</p><p>The Maw’s manifestations may diversify and fracture into ubiquity but we Leech Wizards of games journalism will always be here to intercept its dreadful advance and woo the creature with some absolute gibberish about, I don’t know, overpowered shoes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> or something. Let the cry ring forth once again from the battlements: FEED THE MAW!</p>

<p>According to modder Tr7zw, getting a version of Vanilla Mocha Doom running in Hytale before it's even out took two or three relatively sleepless nights of work. For that sacrifice, their character can stand in the sky above the landscape and Doom away on a monitor made of blocks. </p><p>As with a lot of the more wacky places to play Doom, I'm not sure it's one I'd pick for an extended shooty run, since its visuals do a bit of a number on your eyes at times. Its creator's endorsement comes with some extra caveats, with them noting: "[It] controls a bit like a broken keyboard, the code doesn't follow best practice at all, but it works enough to play the game somewhat." That said, as weird Doom ports always are, it's undeniably impressive.</p>
<p>This showcase has Doom running on an 80x60 block screen at 20 frames per second, with Tr7zw explaining that the Doom port runs in its own thread, generating a screenshot per frame. "I take the screenshot, downsample it to a size Hytale can handle 20 times per second to place, convert it to blocks with the nearest colour, place them," the modder continued. "And the other way, check for player movement/item interactions to provide input into the engine. Basically the same way logic-wise as you would do it in Minecraft. Just that the code works a lot [differently]."</p>
<p>They're hardly the only modder set loose in Hytale to show its modding potential ahead of early access release. Thus far, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme and co have shown off in-house creations which let you <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010372558198018181">command a skeleton army</a>, be <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/2010098788229361925">followed by a floating lantern</a>, and build a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2009579590713549287">claw-based factory conveyor belt</a>. That's in addition to one of team's devs putting togther a prototype of a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010412549486063673">custom side-scrolling adventure</a> using Hytale's toolset.</p>
<p>With mod site <a href="https://x.com/CurseForge/status/2008177774255636830">CurseForge</a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/"></a> set to support Hytale works from day one and Collins-Laflamme having already announced plans to deliver an <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2008226527436304682">in-game mod browser</a> at some point down the line, it's looking like there'll at least be the means for the game to hit the sorts of modding heights enjoyed by Minecraft over the years. That's assuming mod-makers settle in for the long run and don't run into too many technical hurdles.</p>

<p>I bring this up now, when storage prices began climbing back in November, because the past week has been <em>particularly</em> fucked, vis-à-vis the kind of SSDs you’d want in a modern games PC. <a href="https://keepa.com/#!">Keepa</a>, Amazon-tracking the browser extension I’ve long used to gauge the honesty of Prime Day and Black Friday deals, makes for grim reading: the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B7CKVCCV/?th=1">1TB WD Black SN850X</a> currently sits at £162, having been £116 on January 5th, and £85 on November 5th. Nearly double the price, in barely two months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CK2TC9XQ/">Crucial T500</a>, another "recommendable in other circumstances" PCIe 4.0 drive, offered its 2TB version for £140 across most of November. Now it’s £240, having climbed even further from the £193 it cost earlier in January. The closest thing to an upside here is that the T500 will shortly be put out of its misery, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">entire Crucial brand being sacrificed</a> to help expand the AI bubble that made its storage and RAM so unaffordable in the first place.</p>
<p>And it’s not just NVMe SSDs, as the ol' SATA-based <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08PC5DKZQ/">Samsung 870 Evo 1TB</a> has climbed from £83 in November, to £110 in December, to £140 right now. You know something’s gone wrong when you can’t even turn to outmoded tech like SATA drives to avoid the bite. DRAMless SSDs aren’t reliable alternatives either, despite their defining omission – a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) cache, built using the very memory chips that are in such short supply – logically making them more resistant to supply issues. Yet the DRAMless <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CP42QVT8">Samsung 990 Evo</a>, in its 2TB capacity, is going for £233, almost a hundred quid more than its December price of £144.</p><p>Again, there’s no indication that prices will self-right any time soon; even if the supply of DRAM chips increases, they’re more likely to end up in another Big Tech warehouse than in your home desktop. Not counting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD cards</a> for handhelds, that only leaves – urgh – mechanical hard drives as the economically sensible choice for upgrading your PC’s storage. And, as anyone who’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-the-love-of-all-things-good-do-not-install-starfield-on-a-hard-drive">tried to run Starfield on one</a> will tell you, they’re not much of an upgrade at all.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> almost had a 'character creator' system that would have seen you choosing an ancestor from a database of millions of people, rather than being thrust into the riding boots of Scarlet Pimple-esque nobleman Arno Dorian. The idea was broadly to give each player a unique perspective on the complexities of the French Revolution. According to former creative director Alexandre Amancio, this character creation system dates back to a time when the developers were weighing up two versions of the game, one of them far more co-op focussed. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, they rolled with a more familiar flavour of Assassin's Creed, but Amancio - who was also creative director for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a> - still wishes they'd committed to the riskier option for Unity. Our original reviewer Alec Meer might have agreed. Back in 2014, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-unity-review-pc">criticised</a> the game for "reverting to type despite its glitzy surface", and knocked the four-player co-op specifically for simply duplicating Arno: "it is simply boring for everyone to be the same (not particularly interesting) character".
</p>
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development">a recent interview</a> with the chino-wearing, pipe-smoking sophisticates of GamesIndustry.biz. "When we began making Unity, two games started emerging," Amancio told the site's features editor Lewis Packwood following a talk at DevGAMM Lisbon... last November??? Fine, I guess we'll file this under 'news to me'. 
</p>
<p>
"One game was a traditional Assassin's Creed game, with the main protagonist carving his path through the French Revolution, but we also wanted to make a co-op game," Amancio went on. "We found a clever way of hiding a character creation system within Assassin's Creed. Instead of having just one blood ancestor in the Animus, it's a database of millions of people, and you're searching for an ancestor. So the more you describe that ancestor, the more it reduces the search until you find a match.
</p><p>
"The French Revolution is such a complex mishmash of different events and different perspectives that it would have been a more accurate portrayal if, instead of having a linear adventure through the lens of one character, you got your own perspective of the revolution," he continued. "So everyone's experience through the game is their own path through a complex event.
</p>
<p>
"At one point, we needed to choose to make one game or the other. Obviously these are huge investments with huge teams, so we made the decision to make the title that people would most recognize. But somewhere inside of me, I still wish we would've gone for that other one."
</p>
<p>
To play both sides, I can well imagine the hypothetical database-searching feature panning out badly, though it's hard to comment at length based on these crumbs of insight. Creating a repository of millions of potentially playable NPCs so that the player can refine the selection down to one protagonist sounds like a massive expense, needless to say, requiring steep compromises or supernatural forbearance from management on par with that shown to, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>.</p>
<p>It also would have required a different approach to narrative - something closer to an MMO or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, with its selection of protagonist backstories. Hence the "hidden" character creation system being one component of a wholly different Unity concept. As Amancio notes, Unity was the first Assassin's Creed to allow co-op multiplayer within the open world, so even the more conventional version they shipped was a bit of a gamble, despite the well-worn mechanics and framing.
</p><p>
Still, character creation as population database refinement is a cool idea in general, not least because it suggests a period portrayal in which your assassin could be a heroic latrine digger, rather than some lukewarm blueblood adventurer. It makes me think of the collective storytelling of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/velvet-89-is-a-free-hidden-object-game-that-tells-the-story-of-the-czechoslovakian-revolution">Velvet 89</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amancio attributes a little of the Unity database idea's inception to his time working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, a series he feels has more appetite for unscripted upheaval. "I started my career at Ubisoft on Far Cry, not on Assassin's Creed, and I'm a huge fan of systemic games. I like simple, small systems that interact to create emergence. And Assassin's Creed was always open world, but very much a directed game. I've always had this desire to inject a little bit more of that chaos into the game.
</p>
<p>
"For example, adding the bomb system to Revelations was a way of exposing systems to the audience, because you could attract and disperse the crowd. It was a way of giving tools to players. These are the kinds of decisions that I think would have made - and still could make - Assassin's Creed into a more, in my opinion, modern game."
</p>
<p>
It's strange to compare Unity, let alone Revelations to the more recent Creed outings, post Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The series is now far more of an open world RPG and an exercise in pillaging the past. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">summarised</a> the most recent Assassin's Creed Shadows as "a marathon of distraction" and "a reliably Ubisoftian tourist trap that sequesters you in a hedge maze of history with a packed itinerary and a disregard for the time constraints of adult life". I'd like to hear more from Amancio about how they could shake things up. Then again, given that Unity and Revelations are among the less-good Creeds, it's perhaps better that he's no longer part of the picture.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> early access release week, with the recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">resurrected via purchase from Riot</a> blocky sandbox set to ruck up tomorrow, January 13th. Ahead of the big day the Hypixel co-founder who's currently spearheading the game has asked prospective players to download and log into its launcher nice and early, with the hopes this can help keep launch day disruption to a minimum.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said co-founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, outlined in a tweet over the weekend that the Hytale team are anticipating having a stampede of "over 1 million players" to descend on the game over the course of launch day.  As outlined in our handy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">Hytale release times guide</a>, the game'll be emerging from its square cave in the middle of the afternoon UK and European time, with US folks seeing it launch in the morning their time. </p>
<p>Ahead of that, Collins-Laflamme has a couple of steps he's urged prospective players to take. "Please <a href="https://hytale.com/download">download the launcher</a> today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress," he wrote. "Let us know if you are having any issues."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>IMPORTANT</p><p>We expect over 1 million players on the early access release day for Hytale (January 13). Please download the launcher today and log in now to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress.

</p></div>
<p>Provided plenty of folks take those steps, here's hoping Hytale's launch'll avoid serious issues or hugely lengthy queues, though such things are obviously never totally inevitable possibilities when any game goes live. In this case, the fact Hytale's launcher'll be the sole way to access it early doors - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-on-steam-right-away-as-its-devs-want-to-avoid-overindexing-on-negative-reviews-from-players-who-arent-as-well-informed-yet">no versions on Steam</a> or other storefronts at this point - is likely part of what's got the devs concerned about getting everyone in quickly.</p><p>Once you've done the reccomended admin, maybe take a second to make sure you're all caught up on the myriad of things the devs of the rapidly resurrected sandbox have said about what you can expect it to offer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-early-access-release-date-set-in-stone-for-january-2026-but-its-devs-admit-the-first-impression-will-be-rough">right out of the box</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">further down the line</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worth being aware that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-launch-with-native-linux-support-though-the-steam-deck-is-not-officially-recommended">native Linux support</a> will be available for Hytale right from the get go, but it isn't guarunteed to work seamlessly on the Steam Deck right away.</p>
