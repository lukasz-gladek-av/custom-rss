            <p>
Online video games! They're the future of the medium! Or, I guess they're already here, but still, online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> is very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivor's</a> future. It's a feature that's been promised for a little while now, and developer Poncle have shared a little look at it, as well as a confirmation as to when you can expect it: autumn! This autumn, to be precise, which we're currently experiencing, though a more specific window of time wasn't provided.
</p>
<p>
In a short but sweet little trailer, which shows how all you need to do to make a game online is by pressing the online button (that fabled button far too many people think is effectively real), Poncle showed the simple steps you need to take to go online. You start by setting up a lobby with a unique ID, and when your friends (or enemies) start to join, it'll show you what DLC is and isn't available to play through, presumably depending on whether everyone involved owns a specific piece or not.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The wait is nearly over üó£Ô∏è </p><p>Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh) üçÇ</p><p>‚ö†Ô∏è dial-up tones will not be included</p><p>come back next week for another new announcement! üëÄ <a href="https://t.co/NEK0aWr1rS">pic.twitter.com/NEK0aWr1rS</a></p></div>‚Äî Vampire Survivors ü¶á Emerald Diorama OUT NOW üßÑ (@poncle_vampire) <a href="https://twitter.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
After that, everyone selects their character of choice, and you get to surviving vampires! There's also a short, jokey comment that I genuinely find quite fascinating: "We know no one plays together anyway lmao." This doesn't surprise me! As someone who's put a good few hours into Vampire Survivors, I can't see the appeal of playing with someone else in the slightest, it's a game I play to completely shut off - perhaps shutting off with someone else is the appeal for some, or just having something other than a fidget cube to play around with in your hands while yapping on Discord.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this feature still exists, because clearly either enough people have asked for it, no matter how small a number, or Poncle wanted the option there for anyone who might ever want it. There's a value in options like these, options for requests that come from the minority, and as long as they can be completed relatively sustainably, I hope we see more of them. Yes, I know I'm reading too much into what is obviously a joke! That is the curse called writing, I'm afraid.
</p><p>
In any case, Poncle also said there's another announcement coming next week which looks like it has something to do with someone in a crappy skeleton custom in the woods. There's also a visual suggestion that there'll be more announcements in the weeks following that one, so I guess there's big plans for update 1.4 you'll have to keep an eye out for!

            <p>
How about a fresh look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-call-starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-a-sequel-the-original-still-has-years-of-updates-ahead">not-an-Astroneer-sequel</a> from System Era? The developer revealed an extended look at gameplay yesterday, detailing what it is you'll be doing exactly. As has already been established, it's an online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> game, one of those "friendslop" kind of games you'll see people be mean about on Ditter and TikTok comments. To be specific, you can play it solo, or with three of your friends, but there are elements that draw on other players (more on that in a bit).
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of These Kinds Of Games (we really should agree on a name for them at this point), to start off you'll have to prepare for the challenge ahead. You do this on the titular S.S. Starseeker, a big ole ship filled with a bunch of other cutely designed also titularly titled Astroneers. Here, you'll buy and craft different tools and items to bring with you, and decide what it is you want to take with you on expeditions. That might be something useful, or, if you're that kind of person who just likes to goof around while everyone else actually has fun playing the game, you could bring a beach ball instead.

<p>
Expeditions! Structurally these sound pretty par for the course. You land on a planet, you go do a mission or a task or somesuch, and you get back before your oxygen runs out. Along the way there might be alien creatures to do battle with, bits of loot to plunder, that sort of thing.
</p><p>
The Astroneery element of it all is that you have a terrain tool that you can modify in different ways. At its base you just remove terrain, but different nozzles can make it shoot out water, build up the land, launch aliens or yourself into the sky, etc.
</p>
<p>
There's no procedural generation to be found on the planets you visit either, the main one the game is launching with, Tefra, was made by hand, so you'll be able to revisit particular locations from expedition to expedition. As you progress, you'll also unlock more landing zones to other parts of the planet, which subsequently have tougher challenges to face.
</p>
<p>
These challenges might include something simple like repairing some equipment, or bringing up a receiver to a high point on the map. Some of them might even encourage you to work with other groups of players to complete them, a point I quite like - there's not enough online games about collaboration out there!
</p>
<p>
No exact release date just yet, but Starseeker: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/astroneer">Astroneer</a> Expeditions is due out some time in 2026.

            <p>It's pointless me trying to sum this game up before you've clapped the lips of your eyes around it and taken a long drag. There's a trailer below. Do it now. Nod if you've done so. Right, that was Soul Injector Commando, a video game about shooting some semblance of everyday humanity into the bodies of the billionaires who're behind all of the world's problems.</p>

<p>You are the Soul Injector Commando, brought back from the dead by god themselves and sent to a bunker. All of the rich bellends have been handily lured there by an audacious fake meteorite prank worthy of enshrinement atop the YouTube algorithm until the end of time. You romp through, soul injecting until you can soul inject no more.  </p>
<p>There a nine levels to get through, filled with these malcontents who'll "become normal humans, get normal jobs, and be happy" if you succeed. At your disposal are a number of different weapons and upgrades, fully voice acted dialogue I assume will help you tell them the error of their ways, and time trials to try if you get through a bout of soul injecting and decide you'd like to try that level again.</p><p>And, to be frank, why wouldn't you? I can't see the likes of being assembled by a dino head with six arms, blasting your way through a supermarket while coins flick around and a big bowl guy waves a gloved hand in joy/resignation, or driving a tiny SUV with wings getting old quickly. Ditto splattering execs as a sentient golf ball, encountering what looks like an intergalactic skeletal drummer, or fighting whatever the head thing that pops up around the minute mark is. I've not even mentioned the two-headed butterfly knight creature.</p>
<p>To bring us back down to Earth a bit, Soul Injector Commando's the latest work of developer and artist <a href="https://www.jeremycouillard.com/">Jeremy Couillard</a>, who's got a well-honed knack for the surreal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014570/AlienAfterlife/">AlienAfterlife</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188760/JEF/">JEF</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506080/Fuzz_Dungeon/">Fuzz Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164310/Escape_From_Lavender_Island/">Escape From Lavender Island</a>, and the snappily-named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789380/Sometimes_to_Deal_with_the_Difficulty_of_Being_Alive_I_Need_to_Believe_There_Is_a_Possibility_That_Life_Is_Not_Real/">Sometimes to Deal with the Difficulty of Being Alive, I Need to Believe There Is a Possibility That Life Is Not Real</a>. They're all now on my wishlist, and not solely because their art styles are 90% made up of things that my uncle's prog rock band would've given anything to put on their album covers.</p>
<p>Soul Injector Commando doesn't have a release date yet. It strikes me as the kind of game that'll just rock up instantly whenever the universe needs it to. Until then, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3220370/Soul_Injector_Commando/">Steam</a>.</p>
