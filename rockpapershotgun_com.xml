One a them Star Wars was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-a-kotor-spiritual-successor-rpg-led-by-mass-effects-casey-hudson">announced</a> at the Let Geoff Have This He's Got Nothing Else Going On Awards this week, from none other than Casey Hudson. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, a name that will instantly make any Knights of the Old Republic oldhead point at their screen that's Chappie style, which also happens to be a game that Hudson was project director on. The only problem with Fate of the Old Republic is that the studio that's making it only got started this year, calling into question how far away it is - a question that Hudson, kind of, answered.
</p>
<p>
As noted, developer of the game Arcanaut Studios is a wee babby of a studio, with RPS overlord Julian pointing out in his and Mark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-game-awards-2025">Geoffies verdict</a> that optimistically, we'd be looking at a 2028 or 2029 release date for the game. Hudson's response to such an estimation (which is more likely in direct response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">some guy who often seems to know a lot about what happens in the industry</a>) is one of unconvincing substance. "Don’t worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," he wrote on his personal Dwitter account. "Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!"

<p>
You're honestly trying to convince us that a game of likely quite a large scale, with probably too many people working on it, that only has a quite short, pre-rendered trailer that shows off scenes you could find in literally any modern day Star Wars, will be out within the next four years? Hogwash! Malarkey! Balderdash! This isn't the '90s, or the 2000s, or even the 2010s, big name games almost always get delayed, whether it's internally or externally, and I can't see that not happening to this one.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of Hudson and his team at Arcanaut, I do genuinely hope they manage to get it done within such a timeframe, and done in a healthy manner, even if I don't believe it to be possible. You see the water droplets in that trailer? That looked like fricken' real life! If that's what they're aiming for, only the gods can help them.

            <p>
There is something that lies in the belly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> that makes me recoil. The surface level concept is easy enough to follow. It is a 2D pixel art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> where you play as a "forsaken nun" who "walks the long road to absolution." The world you find yourself in in the game's demo is overbearing, crushing. Initially you find yourself in the depths of a church, and even that is worth questioning - what church has depths? When you come across a device, and what on the offset looks like gothic horror a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> becomes perplexingly technological.
</p>
<p>
This device is, mechanically speaking, your main menu. Booting up this menu, you are met with a voice, in text form, that asks you to speak to it. You type in help, literally, with your real-world keyboard, and it gives you a list of options: inventory, journal, settings, all of them with appropriate descriptions, and then OS, the only bit of detail about this option being "me." What else could OS be but operating system, and if that's true, what kind of a world is this?

<p>
These questions go unanswered in the demo, because why would they be, but we must press on. Which would be all well and good if pressing on wasn't such a challenge. Metamorphosis harbours a cruel reality, one where you can die quite quickly and easily, its disgustingly abstract enemies frightening enough to cause you to panic, the purposefully dim lighting causing you to second guess every shadow and precarious jump. Dying puts you right back to where you last saved, which can, of course, be longer ago than you wished it was, and further back to - you can only save at certain points, unless you have some candles to make temporary restore points.
</p><p>
Despite writing for a PC site, I am not particularly good at playing with a keyboard and mouse, and while Metamorphosis is playable on controller, most of the tutorialisation UI is for PC only, forcing me into the old ways as I wasn't sure which button did what. There are a lot of buttons to keep in mind in this game, making it a touch challenging in a potentially unfair way, though I can forgive this for now, as the atmosphere has won me over.
</p>
<p>
Metamorphosis doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and maybe check out its demo for yourself, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470140/METAMORPHOSIS/">here</a>.

            <p>
There has never been a time where the presence of a big Hollywood celeb making an appearance in a video game has drawn me in. Who cares! Most of the time they are not voice actors, and are just doing their own voice, maybe sometimes lending their face. And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice-elevenlabs-1236574041/">happily lending his voice to some AI software</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>, a game that's basically just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," co-founder of Exodus studio Archetype Chad Robertson explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Eurogamer</a> when asked if the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past actor was at all AI-generated in-game.

"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used. The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific."
</p><p>
Robertson also touched on what the studio's long-term stance on AI is, which is currently essentially they have none, but will "have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves," as the tech becomes more widely used. When it comes to Exodus, Robertson also clarified that there's no AI to be found in it: "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan."
</p>
<p>
A current lack of AI doesn't convince me of the game right now, personally. There's nothing about it that screams particularly unique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">sci-fi</a>, just perhaps expensive sci-fi, which is often the worst and most boring kind. Still, it's a while away until any of us find out if that is the case or not, as its Geoffies trailer also positioned it for a 2027 release date.
