            <p>I Don't Want To Be A Good Woman is an abstract walking simulator that depicts the experience of being a young girl in Iran - a country that, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154306">as characterised by UN human rights investigators in September 2024</a>, operates "a system, both in law and in practice, that fundamentally discriminates on the grounds of gender". It takes the form of a molten grey landscape strewn with faceless figures, floating symbols and text.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Play consists of wandering around, witnessing frozen scenes and reading text based on stories the developers We Remember have "heard, gathered, or lived ourselves". The devs have omitted names and their own identities, which I am naturally a bit uneasy about, but the anonymity is to be expected given the Iranian state's <a href="https://iran-shutdown.amnesty.org/">track record for brutal censorship</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3779700/I_Dont_Want_To_Be_A_Good_Woman/">Find it on Steam</a>. Needless to say, I wouldn't play this one lightly. Here is how the developers describe the subject matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>This experience explores real-life challenges faced by women in Iran under Islamic law, including gender-based discrimination, restricted bodily autonomy, and limitations on freedom of expression. Themes such as forced hijab, lack of reproductive rights, and state violence are presented through a narrative lens. While the game contains no explicit imagery, it does involve mature social and political themes.</p>
<p>The game depicts discriminatory behavior toward women by state and religious systems from the perspective of a victim. These portrayals are not meant to promote hate or disparagement, but to raise awareness of real-world issues through an empathetic and objective narrative.</p> </blockquote>
<p>We've covered a few projects that address Iran's society and politics and its recent history. Back in 2013, Adam Smith (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-tehran-1979-revolution-black-friday">wrote about 1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a>, an adventure game created by Iranian developers based inside and outside the country, which casts you as a photojournalist during the overthrow of the (originally CIA and MI6-backed) Pahlavi dynasty.</p>
<p>You might also want to check out this <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/iran-video-games-timeline-from-1970-to-2019">abbreviated history of Iranian video game development</a> for Game Developer, written by Iranian journalist and designer Arash Hackimi in 2020. It spans the creation or importing of new hardware, from the Magnavox Odyssey-esque Video Master through bootlegged Atari 2600s to modern mobile phones; the arrival of Iranian video game magazines, such as Bazi Rayane; the origins of the first Iranian video game developer, Honafa; and the founding of video game festivals, like the Digital Media Festival in 2007.</p>
<p>Hackimi also details a few individual games, including the perpetual motion drawing tool <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/415170/Engare/">Engare</a>, the fantasy action-adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353990/Parvaneh_Legacy_of_the_Lights_Guardians/">Parvaneh</a> and <a href="http://farsh.golabistudio.com/">Farsh</a>, a puzzle game about unrolling carpets. All of which might surprise you if, like me, your understanding of Iran in video games begins and mostly ends with the likes of Prince of Persia.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-dont-want-to-be-a-good-woman-is-a-museum-of-resilience-that-explores-sexism-and-repression-in-iran]]></content:encoded>

            <p>MDK was a 1997 shooter in which you played a pointy headed janitor named Kurt Hectic with a parachute suit and a gun for an arm, the best thing about it being its Giger-ish <a href="https://psxdatacenter.com/images/screens/P/M/SLES-00599/ss6.jpg">sniper mode interface</a>. MDK is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mortality-decomp-killers">Mortality Decomp. Killers</a> - a sour lollipop puke hued <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/post-void">Post Void</a>-like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>'s lethality and a very good spinny knifey move. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560730/MORTALITY_DECOMP_KILLERS/">completely free on Steam</a>, although you can pick up the soundtrack for a few quid if you fancy supporting it. After each level, your score breakdown includes how many doors you've "killed". Not since my beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mullet-mad-jack">Mullet Mad Jack</a> has a game facilitated such reckless hinge hatred.</p>

<p>You play as Clive, a jaw-headed detective resurrected by a parasite and recruited into a secret taskforce, with the secret task of killing many people with a six shooter revolver and machete. The game lies in surviving ultra-lethal encounters by timing your reloads well, using cover smartly, and knowing when to use an excellent machete swing with some deeply satisfying forward propulsion. The game "contains lots of gore and violence against crooks and criminals," reads the content warning, which I'm sure the Hays code would approve of.</p>
<p>There's also a "noir mode" if you find the, I assume, deliberately headachey visuals a bit <em>too </em>headachey. Also, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560730/MORTALITY_DECOMP_KILLERS/">latest patch</a> includes the note: "added 'Invert Y' sensitivity setting for FREAKS", which I approve of. Again, it's very free, seemingly forever, and is worth the small download just for that machete spin.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mortality-decomp-killers-is-a-free-post-void-like-that-scores-you-on-how-many-doors-youve-killed]]></content:encoded>
