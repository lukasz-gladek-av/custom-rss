            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> first galloped onto the scene in 2020, with a bombastic trailer at Gamescom 2023 showcasing some particularly beautiful medieval open world action adventuring. It's got horses, fishing, plate armour and roving heroism, but one thing it lacks is a release date. Now, thanks to The Geoff Awards, that's changed! Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the game, you play as Kliff who explores the open world of Pywel. In said open world, you battle goblins and medieval people. You ride wyverns. Do some rock climbing, cooking, maybe a puzzle. Apparently there are "aerial Abysses" that promise "endless discovery". Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-in-action-looks-like-a-sort-of-janky-assassins-creedlike-where-you-explode-stuff-a-lot">thought</a> its first showing reminded her of mid-series Assassin's Creed games when "it got a bit silly". What do I think? I think it looks a bit like it's trying to do too much and, quite possibly, will succumb to this, ending in a 6/10 experience for all involved. Huh, that actually sounds quite good - I could do with more middling silliness.</p>

<p>Our James gave the game a whirl at this year's Gamescom and wasn't all <em>that</em> impressed by it. While he thought there was some spectacle in what was clearly a fight-oriented demo, said fighting felt "twangy" and "unwieldy" to him. In those brief moments outside of the sword-clanging, he described its exploration as "delightfully madcap", which sounds incredibly appealing.

            <p>Stealth launching a game during an awards ceremony is cool. But you know what's cooler? Stealth launching a union. As many in the games industry settled in for an evening of advertisements and blockbuster backslapping, one group of US workers quietly succeeded in organising something of their own. Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zosunited.bsky.social/post/3ld5jhpai6226">on social media site Bluesky</a> last night. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The members include engineers, artists, web developers, and game designers. Most of these workers are based in Maryland, say the union, but others are spread across the states, in California, New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Texas. </p>
<p>"With a union, we are looking forward to collectively pushing for improvements to the workplace," they say, "including job security, protections against AI, better pay and benefits – in an industry that we’re so deeply passionate about."</p>
<p>That mention of "job security" is the obvious concern, given the grave number of layoffs in recent years, thousands of which have fallen upon Microsoft-owned studios. Zenimax Online Studios are the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, and are themselves owned by the Windows peddlers.</p><p>Microsoft has officially recognised the union, but you should know that a labour agreement following the big fat Activision Blizzard acquisition last year essentially means that they do this because they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-ahead-of-activision-blizzard-deal">are required to do so</a>. Which partly explains why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">Zenimax QA workers</a> have also been able to recently unionise with perhaps more ease than a studio under another company.</p>
<p>The Zenimax Online union that arose last night has been formed under the Communication Workers of America, a parent union that has been organising workers across the states for some years now. Earlier this year that parent group also helped another band of Elder Scrolls developers at Bethesda Game Studios to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">form their own union too</a>, consisting of 241 workers. </p>
<p>"We're working against some pretty massive corporations," a CWA organiser told Nic when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">spoke to them recently about their organising campaign</a>.“The imbalance of power is very obvious. So you try to organise in secret so that people can't be totally derailed from exercising their rights before they even have a chance to understand those rights.”</p>
<p>I can think of no greater sneak attack than doing it as soon as Geoff Keighly gets up on stage. Nice work. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
