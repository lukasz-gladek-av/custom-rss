            <p>You know how it is: you rush to the bus stop because you think you're going to miss it, then it arrives 12 years late. Typical. The makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> have shown off a short trailer with a big shiny European coach in it. It confirms that the sim will add driveable buses in some form soon, fulfilling a long-forgotten tease that was first made by the developers back in the cloudy days of 2013. </p>

<p>The trailer was included in a brief <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/547862446583318213?snr=1_5_9_">update post on Steam</a>, showing a big white bus pulling out from behind a Scania truck. Surprise! The game is basically now Euro Truck And/Or Bus Simulator 2. </p>
<p>"We’ve crossed borders, hauled freight, and explored countless cities across Europe," say developers SCS Software. "But just like any great journey, the road is always full of surprises. Something different is pulling into view, a new way to experience the world of Euro Truck Simulator 2. See you at the next stop."</p>
<p>The devs haven't said exactly what form the buses will take, or which lurching road carriages will appear (please, not Megabus) but it'll likely be a big DLC pack. It is the culmination of a desire the developers seem to have harboured for over a decade. They first pondered the possibility of adding buses back in February 2013, writing in <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2013/02/a-coach-bus.html">a blog post</a> they were "exploring an opportunity to go beyond just trucks" and saying they were off "recording sounds and taking tons of photos of a Scania Touring HD Bus". But it looks like those plans got delayed on the roadside until now. </p>
<p>It's a pleasant possibility to some but not surprising to all. Some players have noted the appearance of more detailed bus stops along their usual trucking routes in recent updates, and say the bussification of the sim makes sense. Although others in the game's Steam forums seem grumpy that buses aren't getting their own dedicated sim. However you feel, it's a move that's in keeping with the studio's recent plans for their other sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, which plans to introduce driveable pickup trucks and other smaller cars as part of <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/04/project-road-trip.html">a "Road Trip" expansion</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We might rightly judge Batman Arkham-style combat by how cool the counters make you feel, what with the core of it melting into second-nature rhythmic meditation that renders you basically unkillable after a few minutes of practice. You will win the fight. This is guaranteed. The combat is designed to make you win. Usually the second tutorial prompt is "here's the button that makes you win. Don't worry if you don't know when to press it. We'll tell you".</p>
<p>Likewise, you will win the fights in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-as-disco">Dead As Disco</a>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/">Steam demo</a>. Maybe the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> after the demo gets harder. I dare not predict the future. But this is not the important part. The important part is that you will feel very cool as you easily win. You can hold down a button to beat your enemies with a glowstick that hits about three times to every beat in the music. It feels like doing violence with a turbo maraca made of steel and also filled with steel balls. You can also import your own music, so maybe this doesn't exactly line up with, say, <a href="https://youtu.be/qc98u-eGzlc">Meshuggah's Bleed</a>. But it certainly lines up with Michael Sembello's She's A Maniac. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>There are two types of finishers. Two. One you can do just before an attack to counter, and another you can do just after a dodge. Each one displays more physical activity than I have performed this year, combined. But you can just keep doing them. Such is the power of disco. Also, your enemies dance when the stage starts. Also also, one of the stages has dangerous trains. Does hearing about dangerous trains make you hungry? Understandable. Here's a menu of features.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fight to music:</strong> attack, dodge, and take-down enemies in perfect sync with the music. Master the musical path of each Idol to unlock new talents, moves, and dances. The groove isn’t just for the show: it’s your ultimate Beat Kune Do.</p>
<p><strong>Rockstar Customizatio</strong>n: Collect over-the-top fashion from all the stars in the world of Disco. No matter what look you choose, you’ll always leave an impression.</p>
<p>Customize your home away from home, the Dive Bar, by collecting memorabilia from past and present, and in the process unlock the true story of what really happened to the band.</p>
<p><strong>Jam Together:</strong> Team up in Co-op, or compete on the leaderboards to be king of the dancefloor.</p>
<p><strong>Upload, Mods, And Ugc:</strong> Upload your own music, edit music videos, and craft your own music-synced gameplay spectacle! Dead as Disco is a UGC mosh pit ready for modding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your character is named 'Charlie Disco'. I can't believe our little Charlie Disco grew up to love disco music. That's such a lovely coincidence. Dead As Disco's release is still TBA.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>This week is the week of Summer Game Fest and its entourage of accompanying showcases. As such, the feeling right now is of preparing for an avalanche. Join me as I play out the next few days in my head.</p>
<h2>Monday 2nd June</h2>
<ul>
<li>All is calm beneath the Treehouse, and yet, there is something in the air. I look up from my game of dark fantasy creature collector <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754370/Voidsayer/">Voidsayer</a> and watch a single leaf cartwheeling along the forest floor. I frown and turn my attention to budding Beyond Good &amp; Evilalike, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1344990/Zefyr_A_Thiefs_Melody/">Zefyr: A Thief's Melody</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 3rd June</h2>
<ul>
<li>A few more leaves flitter down from the canopy. The ground seems blurry and something peculiar is going on in my lower intestine, but it's not enough to distract me from 80s business builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2532490/Rise_of_Industry_2/">Rise Of Industry 2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 4th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Across the clearing, Brendy breaks off from his tentative nosing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune Chapters 1-4</a>. He sits on his hindlegs, lifts his muzzle to the sky and begins to howl.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 5th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is no time to consider <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma</a>, as Nic and Oisin burst from the undergrowth in a circus of blindfire and swearing. Nic has taken a boulder to the knee, so Oisin is carrying him over one shoulder while he unloads a sawed-off into the vibrating shrubbery. How many times must we tell you, Nic, that you can't defeat natural disasters with shotguns?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 6th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>All of a sudden the daylight vanishes as no less than three video game showcases rear above the canopy in furiously mechanical succession. First, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tbuFnsaR50">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a> at 8am PDT, 11am EDT and 4pm BST. Then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hr6Q2hln_M&amp;list=PLi9Mlnjwioo-ml1tAcHqOvAh4NDBmSG7h&amp;index=4">Summer Game Fest Live</a> at 2pm PDT, 5pm EDT and 10pm BST. Then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DayoftheDevs/videos">Day of the Devs SGF Edition</a> at 4pm PDT, 7pm EDT and 12am BST. The individual fragments of rock and ice all sport the sleepily smiling face of Geoff Keighley. I see Graham on a surfboard high above the trees, carving the froth of advertising.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Saturday 7th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>The weekend offers no reprieve from the tumult! Ollie and I have made it back into the Treehouse with bloody elbows and a few broken ribs. The tree itself bends sickeningly but does not break: the Founders chose their primeval refuge well. Three more showcases - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ZRXGcmDlM">Wholesome Direct</a> (9am PDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FutureGamesShow">Future Games Show</a> (1pm PDT, 4pm EDT, 9pm BST) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thegameawards/videos?view=2&amp;sort=dd&amp;live_view=502&amp;shelf_id=1">Green Games Showcase</a> (1pm PDT, 4pm EDT, 9pm BST) - sweep through the woods like dervishes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sunday 8th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hell is empty, and all the marketing VPs are here. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox">Xbox Games Showcase</a> (10am PDT, 1pm EDT, 6pm BST) and <a href="https://www.pcgamingshow.com/">PC Gaming Show</a> (12pm PDT, 3pm EDT, 8pm BST) obliterate all the lesser trunks that remain. Ollie and I let off signal flares. Where is Jeremy? Is that his fist emerging from the fusillade of Keighley particulates, forming one last defiant thumbs-up? Oh look, here's James in a helicopter. He brings word of a secondary calamity: the other side of the mountain has been annihilated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-event-schedule-2025">Ian Games Network Live</a>.</li>
<p>What are you up to this week? If you plan to steer clear of all of the above, my hearty congratulations to you.</p></ul>
