            <p>Last night was a bumper time for games being delayed yet again, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> quickly following in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s probably rather expensive shoes. Skydance New Media have now pushed the release of their superhero game "beyond early 2026", with no concrete new release target given.</p>
<p>Rise of Hydra was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Christmas%202025">previously delayed</a> from what looked like it'd be a release around Christmas 2025 to early next year, with Skydance citing a need to spend more time polishing their World War 2-era costumed capers.</p>

<p>"Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the studio wrote in their post announcing this latest delay. "To fully realise our vision for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.</p>
<p>"We’re grateful for the passion and support from the community and players around the world. The team is working hard to create something truly special, and we look forward to sharing more with you as development progresses."</p> <div>

<p>Rise of Hydra was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uncharted-directors-black-panther-and-captain-america-game-revealed-as-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-out-2025">revealed back in 2024</a> with a GDC trailer heavy on Nazi bottom-kicking by Captain America and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>, who seem to be experiencing a bit of 'this rendition of 1940s occupied Paris in which someone's stapled the letter V to the Eiffel Tower ain't big enough for the two of us' syndrome. Howling Commandos soldierman Gabriel Jones and Wakandan spy Nanali fill out the cast of four playable characters in the game, which is being directed by former Uncharted writer and director Amy Hennig.</p><p>We've not seen all that much of Hydra since that first trailer, aside from some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alleged-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-fight-video-shows-black-panther-having-an-angry-cat-moment-in-a-bar">alleged leaks</a> which included a video of Black Panther doing some catty fighting and stills of various environments which could provide a backdrop to more super scrappage.</p>
