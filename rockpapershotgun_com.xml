I've been excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roman-sands-rebuild">Roman Sands RE:Build</a> since the moment I laid my eyes on it, particularly because it's from the same studio behind the ever-haunting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>. Roman Sands just has a ridiculously strong art direction to it, very much one that could easily be dubbed Y2K, but I think more accurately should be seen as an evolution of the aesthetic/ era. Almost as if this is the direction it could have gone in.

Just great stuff, not even counting the oddball gameplay, and as revealed in a new trailer, it's got a release date now too: September 12th. That's close enough for me to count down the days, but far away enough for me to think "I'd like to be playing this right now actually, ta very much." The trailer offered a new look at its strange, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> hotel and all of its guests, as well as a tease for the things you'll be getting up to (all of which seem quite ominous.

The gameplay itself sees you attending to the demands of said guests as outlandish as they all are, but the clock is working against you. Specifically, a clock that'll see the sun swallowing up the world. Terrifying! And a great hook. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231460/Roman_Sands_REBuild/">There's a demo you can check out on Steam too</a>, or you can just wishlist it if you want to wait for the full thing.

Excitingly, the release date trailer also had a mysterious tease for Paratopic: Overdub, seemingly an anniversary edition of the game. Over on its <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2346939?tab=compose">Steam page</a> it's described as a remaster/ remix/ sequel, and look, it could be none of those things and I'd still be in. Paratopic is a peak example of the modern trend of PS1-inspired games, using the aesthetic to really hone in on its subtle horrors. Whatever this new thing contains, I'll take it. It's coming September 12th too, so I'm sure like me you'll be plenty busy that day!

            <p>
Now, I'm not naming any names here, but there's a certain hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> that everyone's a bit sick of waiting for by this point, and could really do with a release date. OK, fine, yes it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and if those recent Steam backend updates mean anything, I expect it'll get some kind of update sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>, also a hand-drawn metroidvania, that actually does have a release date.

In Constance, you play as a purple-haired painter who is "striving to escape from a colorful but decaying inner-world, created by her declining mental health." Mental health themes are nothing new in the world of indie games, but that's not what really sells me on Constance. That'd be the tight-looking platforming and snappy, paint-brush oriented combat.

You literally fight and hop dart around with a massive paintbrush, using it to do pretty much everything, from glooping up the side of a wall, to doing quick brush strokes that let you dodge. Occasionally you'll even have to do some actual painting, if you can believe it! The thing looks lovely too, I'm a sucker for hand-drawn games, as they always feel like labours of love. Aesthetically that certainly seems to be the case here, so I'm hoping the full release lives up to its look. There's a demo to available too, so you and I could always give that a go to find out!
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, release date! That'll be November 24th, a few months away still, but I'm sure you can wait. As I said, I really wouldn't be surprised if Silksong does get dated this weekend, but definitely consider keeping Constance on your radar too, I'm sure more than enough people are going to pick up the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel. You can wishlist Constance on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">here</a>.
