            <p>Valve recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">changed Steam's rules and regulations</a> to give banks, payment processors, and internet service providers some control over the definition of acceptable "adult content" on Steam, in line with their own respective policies. As Valve suggested to RPS in a statement, it was either that or risk a credit card firm or bank blocking Steam purchases at large. Alongside all this, Valve also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted a bunch of sexually explicit games</a>, including a number of games that depict incest.</p>
<p>Valve have yet to specify which games they've delisted as a direct result of the policy change, or which particular institutions prompted them to make this rather momentous shift. But it looks increasingly like the result of an anti-violent pornography game campaign directed at Valve, Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Paysafe Limited, Discover and the Japan Credit Bureau in early July, carried out by Australian pressure group Collective Shout. This is the conclusion offered by Collective Shout themselves, anyway - they've described the Steam delistings as <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1946431955446431970.html">a "victory for child safety campaigners"</a>, while commenting that they are now being sent misogynistic abuse and threats by players in retaliation.</p><!--more-->
<p>Founded in 2009, Collective Shout have long called for the banning or delisting of games they regard as violently sexist, exploitative and abusive, as part of a wider campaign against the sexualisation and objectification of women in media. Much of their campaign is based on the argument that there is a causal relationship between such representations and real-life abuse. On their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/about">About page</a>, they quote a 2016 <a href="https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1783913257&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=44UOE_INST:44UOE_VU2&amp;lang=en&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=Everything&amp;query=null,,1995,%20%C2%A91995">meta-analysis of 135 studies of media sexualisation</a> carried out by L. Monique Ward. I don't have the permissions to access it, but according to the abstract, exposure to "sexually objectifying portrayals" of women is "directly associated with a range of consequences, including higher levels of body dissatisfaction, greater self-objectification, greater support of sexist beliefs and of adversarial sexual beliefs, and greater tolerance of sexual violence toward women."</p>

<p>The latest action against Steam appears to have begun on July 11th, when Collective Shout published an <a href="https://archive.ph/o/x5cGQ/https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors">"open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest + child abuse games on Steam"</a>. The open letter cites Collective Shout's <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/tags/no_mercy">previous call for the removal</a> of an outright rape simulation game, No Mercy, and states that they have "discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and Itch.io". It does not share any details of the games in question.</p>
<p>As a result of this letter, Collective Shout claim to have brought about the delisting of 500 games from Steam, a statement that Valve have yet to corroborate (and which as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/">PCGamer</a> observe, appears to include a number of duplicate entries). They're also calling for the removal of a further 82 games "tagged with rape and incest", without sharing names.</p>
<p>I think it would be constructive for Collective Shout to specify the games they're referring to publicly, and to articulate the context of the sexual content they're objecting to, given that some of their previous campaigns against "sickening" video games make assumptions that border on misinformation. In 2018, for example, Collective Shout <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">endorsed a petition for a ban</a> on the sale of Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> in Australia, declaring that it features "child abuse and violence against women."</p>
<p>I am no great fan of Quantic Dream, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">have been accused of cultivating sexism in their workplace</a> and who have a track record for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/detroit-become-human-review-marginalized-struggle/">using sexual violence to define their female characters</a>, but it seems important to insist - as the petition itself acknowledges - that the scenes referred to are, in fact, <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/939703243956895744">designed to create empathy for the victim</a> as part of a story about social injustice. They are not wish fulfilment for abusers. Collective Shout's endorsing of the petition suggests minimal familiarity with the game they're trying to ban.</p>

<p>In 2014, similarly, Collective Shout called for a ban on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s sale in Australia, summarising it as a "video game that encourages players to brutally murder women for entertainment". I think it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>'s portrayal of women has long been abysmal - this is the series that turns sex workers into health packs and yes, lets you kill them afterwards to recover your fee. I'm interested to see whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> changes the record here - it has a female protagonist (and an often-underdressed male co-star), but is also partial to booty shots in trailers.</p>
<p>At the same time, GTA has never been a series designed to indulge fantasies about murdering women and sex workers. The Changelog.org petition in question does not place its allegation in the context of a farcical open world simulation in which it is possible to brutally murder <em>everybody</em>, from pimps to the police. Again, it does not give much indication that Collective Shout and the organisers played the game they're trying to have removed from sale.</p>
<p>Valve's change of policy has prompted an outcry from developers of erotic games and journalists who see this as continuing a pattern of financial institutions using their control of transactions to silence 'taboo' expressions of sex and sexuality - a push for conformity that may accompany a sincere desire to protect children and women from exploitation, or may simply use that professed desire as camouflage for, say, a conviction that trans and queer people are deviants, and that sex work of any kind should be illegal.</p>
<p>The discovery that Collective Shout may have goaded Mastercard and co into demanding changes has fuelled this argument, given Collective Shout's connections to certain fundamentally religious and conservative-leaning organisations such as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) and Exodus Cry - both of whom signed Collective Shout's open letter from July 11th.</p>
<p>In an investigation for Vice, Ana Valens dug into the history of these groups, which I'll summarise with a few pieces of information from my own research. Exodus Cry are an American Christian non-profit advocacy organization who seek the abolition of the legal commercial sex industry, from porn to strip clubs and sex work, as well as illegal sex trafficking. In 2013, their founder and CEO, Benjamin Nolot, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/11/melissa-mccarthy-exodus-cry-apology">compared abortion to the Holocaust and described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God"</a>, though he says his views on these subjects have changed since.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>NCOSE, meanwhile, were founded by American clergymen in the 1960s, and have asserted that pornography at large is a "public health crisis". Katherine Cross <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-illuminating-the-shadowy-group-celebrating-valve-s-latest-censorship-drive">wrote a piece for Game Developer</a> in 2018 about NCOSE's previous attempts to have games featuring "sexual exploitation" removed from Steam, concluding that "what these groups actually want has nothing to do with the dignity of anyone, and everything to do with restoring a traditional gender order that criminalizes both sexual expression and sexual labor."</p>
<p>I'd tell you to read the rest of Valens's piece on Vice, but Vice have since pulled the article and a previous article on Collective Shout, without explaining why. Valens has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v">claimed</a> that Vice's parent company, Savage Ventures, called for the removal of her articles "due to concerns about the controversial subject matter - not journalistic complaints". She and several other staffers have now resigned from the site in protest. I'll ask Savage Ventures for comment. In the meantime, you can find a copy of Valens' article on <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>As for my own take on the situation, I don't think it can be disputed that violent sexualised media contributes to a culture of violent sexualisation, but the extent of that contribution is difficult to identify and as such, needs to be addressed case-by-case. Collective Shout, so far, have avoided going into details - they haven't disclosed which games they consider abhorrent, or explained why these games in particular are in contravention of Steam's existing prohibition against games that promote hatred, violence, or discrimination based on gender, or which "exploit children in any way".</p>
<p>Collective Voice may be sincere in their anger and desire to protect women and children, but it's not enough to say that certain topics are self-evidently unfit for representation in a work of fiction and enlist vast financial corporations as enforcers - particularly when your choice of affiliations suggests you may have ulterior motives, and particularly when you have a track record for getting important details wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What is the half-life of comedy? WRONG. Comedy is a vibe, not a substance, you buffoon. I know this because I am a man of science. I have played survival crafting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> for an unspecified number of hours, and have learned many things. Most recently, I learned that the developers are releasing it from early access peer review today, but the shiny version 1.0 comes with a few notes scribbled hastily in the margins. If you already have a save file and don't want to lose any pet mutants you've trained, you might want to read on. </p>

<p>"Before you update your save to the new 1.0 version, please take your Pests out of their Pest Traps and Pest Wheels!" developers Deep Field Games warn in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085900698">a guide to upgrading your save</a>. "Pests in cages or wheels will be lost so be sure to set them out to roam before updating!"</p>
<p>Pests, for those uninitiated, are slimy cross-dimensional maggot things that normally attack you, but can be subdued and turned into pets, which is an anagram of "pest". Is rearranging letters an indivisible element of comedy? We do not yet know. Further research is required.</p>
<p>Anyway, the warning above is just one small note in a handy guide that details how much the update is likely to affect players' existing worlds. Mostly, your base, character and story progress will be fine. But pets seem to have proven tricky to cross over. Soups too.</p>
<p>"Due to some changes in how we store soup data (now stored in a better, cleaner way) existing pots full of soup that have been placed in the world will all be turned into Pest Goulash," say the devs. Yes, you do also chop up and eat the pests.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you're coming into Abiotic Factor as a new player none of this will be a problem. Likewise if you intend to restart from the beginning, something which the developers gently suggest is a good option. </p>
<p>"Starting a new world save when 1.0 lands will give you a more 'intended' playthrough with more tools at your disposal," says design director Geoff "Zag" Keene, "but if you don’t want to do that, that’s fine too. I’m not going to make you do anything. I’m not your dad."</p>
<p>Thanks dad - I mean Zag. Whichever way you come at this, you're in for a good time if you slurp often upon survival games. Abiotic Factor was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a> just on the strength of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> adjacent sense of humour. As for the future of the blood-spattered labratory explorer, the devs are "already working on ABF’s next update plans" and promise that it'll continue to see "bug fixes, quality of life improvements and general support". </p>
<p>Version 1.0 is due to come out today at 6pm BST, aka 1pm EDT. Please don't ask me to type out any more time zones. I'm not World Time Buddy. Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543361383085904750">a map with all the release times</a> from the developer. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scientifically-funny-survive-em-up-abiotic-factor-is-hitting-version-10-today-and-your-pets-are-in-danger]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developers Spiders are going ahead with a layoff plan that'll see "most" of their animating and rigging team affected, according to a post from a lead animator at the Nacon-owned studio.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/">LinkedIn post</a> by Erwan Perrin, whose profile cites him as having been a permanent Spiders staffer since 2021, has been reposted by at least four other workers at the the studio.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected," Perrin wrote. As of writing, Spiders gameplay animator Lucas Dubois, game designer Antoine Dieulesaint, game animator Raphaël Brousseau, and dialogue artist Yaseen Lalmahomed are among those who've reposted the message.</p>
<p>It's currently unclear how many staff have been affected by these alleged cuts. We've reached out to Spiders for comment.</p>

<p>Spiders released Greedfall 2 into early access last September, with the game's reviews sitting at mixed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_II_The_Dying_World/">Steam</a> as of writing. Shortly before that release, 44 of Spiders' 95 workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-developers-call-a-strike-over-working-conditions-lack-of-gender-equality-and-parity-and-global-mismanagement">signed an open letter</a> calling for a strike over working conditions and wider management practices at the studio. Among the issues cited were "global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations".</p>
<p>Spiders responded by saying that these were "false and even defamatory accusations" which "in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's employees", adding that the studio's management were "committed to open and constructive social dialogue". Subsequent negotiations between Spiders and the French union representing the staff, the Syndicat des Travailleurs/ses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spiders-release-fantasy-rpg-greedfall-2-in-early-access-as-its-frustrated-workers-are-offered-concessions">look to have yielded</a> some promises that the workers would recive an "audit" of their working conditions, as well as bonuses based on Greedfall 2's performance in early access.</p>
<p>This year's been a particularly brutal one in terms of layoffs across the games industry, with Oblivion Remastered co-developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-developers-virtuos-are-reportedly-planning-layoffs-with-300-workers-at-risk">Virtuos</a> being among the companies which have recently thrown workers into the void. Here's hoping that if Spiders devs are being let go, they can land on their feet.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-studio-spiders-set-for-layoffs-thatll-affect-most-of-their-animators-and-riggers-dev-claims]]></content:encoded>
