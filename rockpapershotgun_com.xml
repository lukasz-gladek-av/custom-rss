            <p>Quick, get down! It's enhanced!</p>

<p>Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</p>
<p>Phew. That was close. Although I fear your face will never quite be the same again. A tremendous loss for faces, but a possible gain for anyone curious what Obsidian were up to in 2006. Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> - Enhanced Edition is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a>, although you have just missed the 10% discount for being a faithless worm and not pre-ordering. Soak in the shame of your minor monetary penalty, worm. That'll learn you to take a publisher's word for it next time. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The new edition boasts "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI." There's obviously a bit of vagueness here, and as far as I can tell Aspyr haven't gone into detail for e.g what "polished mechanics" actually means. Although Aspyr's Jordan Reese did share the following with <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-interview/">Nintendo Everything</a> recently, via <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50714-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-dev-details-improvements-to-graphics-and">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Weâ€™ve made several overall gameplay enhancements, many of which are noticeable as soon as you boot the game such as graphical overhauls and UI/UX redesigns, while others like updating the game client to a 64-bit architecture, and networking infrastructure are a little more behind the scenes to support modern hardware."</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, again, isn't a tonne to go on, although Reese also confirmed that you'll be able to switch to the "classic UI and control scheme". The edition also includes all three of the original's expansions, plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> and mod support. Although, again no explicit confirmation on whether old mods will work. Sensing a pattern here. Fingers crossed, since it's become a bit of a favourite for modders over the years. You can even play the entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 1 campaign inside of it, in case you want to confirm that Larian didn't Flanderise Minsc - he was genuinely always like that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-hottest-dungeons-dragons-rpg-of-2006-is-out-now-in-ostensibly-enhanced-form]]></content:encoded>
