            <p>
There's a newish Persona game on the way next month, and it is, of course, yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5</a> spinoff. I'm not sure if another cow in existence has been so thoroughly milked before, but here we are. I call <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: The Phantom X (that's its name, by the way) newish because it's actually been available in China through an ongoing open beta for the last year. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> held a pre-recorded livestream confirming that the mobile game is finally coming westward, and that it'll be getting a PC release as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, despite being Persona 5 by name and aesthetic, it'll be offering up some fresh characters for once. You're still the Phantom Thieves, just a different bunch - the protagonist in this one is called Wonder, and the animal companion is an owl-looking critter. 
</p>

<a aria-label="P5X News -First announcement!

<p>
Much like in the original, during the day you'll hang out with friends and study, and at night you'll venture out into dungeons. Apparently you will be able to meet Joker and other characters from the almost decade-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> (see what I mean about milking that cow) as part of special contracts. You'll apparently also find PvE elements called Velvet trials, alongside mini-games and the ability to make and join guilds.
</p>
<p>
It's definitely worth mentioning that this very much does seem to be Atlus' (very late) response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, as it is a free-to-play gacha game. Not ideal, particularly for those that find it difficult to play gacha games, but I'm sure Atlus will figure out how they can make yet another spinoff at some point.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's June 26th, a little over a month away, meaning you could probably fit in a Persona 5 replay as long as you just don't eat or sleep at all until then.

You know what got announced a little over three years ago now? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. You know what hasn't had a single new trailer in that time? Ding ding ding! If you said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, you don't win anything because the direction of this bit was pretty obvious. The game still doesn't have a new trailer, by the way, but the series' official Blue Sky account did oh so generously offer up a handful of screenshots today which do show off some new bits (mostly).

In the pair of posts, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> wrote that they're "currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support."

In terms of the screenshots themselves, there's best boy Sora in his real-world look skating along some chains in a city, with some Heartless-like enemies beneath him. There's Strelitzia, the girl you would have seen in the first trailer, and a character that will mean absolutely nothing to you if you haven't played the mobile game. There's a couple more shots of Sora just… standing around. All in all, there's two actually notable screenshots.
</p>
<p>
One is the fact that you get to play as Mickey Mouse again, who's cheekily hanging out on top of a chandelier in a library. This'll likely be Scala ad Caelum, the last world you visit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, as Mr. Michael Mouse was sent there at the end of Melody of Memory (that's right, even the rhythm game has important cutscenes).
</p>
<p>
The other screenshot, interestingly, is of an old rotary phone. A few people believe this might be something akin to a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-are-wind-phones-and-how-do-they-help-with-grief-180985113/">wind phone</a>. These are often disconnected rotary phones found in the middle of nowhere, where people have one-way conversations with a loved one that's passed on. The trend of using them started in Japan too, and considering what happens to Sora at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3, I'm inclined to buy into this one.
</p>
<p>
If you're wondering why Square Enix showed off these new screenshots on a random Wednesday in May, it'll likely be to do with the fact the developer cancelled the series' next entry Missing Link <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-mobile-game-cancelled-but-its-not-all-bad-news-as-square-enix-teases-it-is-hard-at-work-on-kingdom-hearts-4">just yesterday</a>. This one was set to be a Pokemon Go-like mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you could make your own character. I imagine this cancellation has something to do with Square Enix's multiplatform plan they established last year, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-reiterates-plans-for-quality-over-quantity-and-multiformat-games-going-forward/">a point it doubled down on during its latest financial results</a>.
</p>
<p>
Any which way, I'll take a JPEG of a rotary phone and Mickey Mouse over silence. Thanks Nomura/ Square Enix's social team who probably stressed that they needed something to placate people!

Many are the minigames that threaten to be more entertaining than the games that host them, stealing the player’s attention like those flatworms that absorb snails from the inside. Tetra Master. Gwent. Fishing in any number of RPGs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSSGZ9O8RX4">The flushable sinks in Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Or how about Space Harrier, which has only ever existed as an arcade cabinet offering inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, these minigames escape the host's body and achieve a standalone eistence. It’s not <em>entirely</em> true to say this of Dicealot, which is based on Farkle, a dice game you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-play-dice"> may have played</a> inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>For Farkle is actually a real medieval dice game from the 12th century, in which you roll six dice and score by achieving certain combinations. Dicealot takes a few liberties with the premise: it introduces a frame narrative in which Queen Gwynevere is trying to save a bewitched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>, together with additional power and quest dice, acquired from mission to mission, that modify the basic rules. It’s a roguelite, in other words. I know, we haven’t played a lot of those lately. Here’s a trailer.
</p>

<p>
There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035330/Dicealot/">a demo on Steam</a> if you’d like to give it a whirl. I am keen on the presentation: it’s like an illuminated parchment and a cathode-ray TV had a baby, and the baby grew up and dabbled in art deco. 
</p>
<p>
The developers are Goodviewgames, who are based in based in Leeds and Bordeaux. I was born in Leeds and still have family in Yorkshire. I assure you that I discovered this after viewing and enjoying the trailer. Let it be known, developers and publishers, that you will not automatically earn my interest if you happen to be based in Leeds. Though if you do want to relocate there and host some studio visits, it’d mean I could see my dad more often. Ball's in your court.
