            <p>Naming things is often difficult. Accurately translating things is often difficult. Put the two together, and you get the situation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> dungeon crawler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/">The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</a> has recently found itself in, when the Japanese translation of its name on Steam saw it accidentally re-dubbed "Crap Dungeon".</p>
<p>Let's face it, this has happened to all of us. You're working on a 2D adventure about delving into crypts, it's picked to show up at the Tokyo Game Show, and then next thing you know you're in a crap dungeon without a sword-shaped paddle. Ok, maybe not <em>all</em> of us.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-accidentally-names-game-crap-dungeon-on-japanese-steam-store-in-apparent-localization-mishap/">Automaton</a>, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles being named "Kuso Dungeon" on the Japanese version of its Steam page was first picked up by amused native speakers, who took to the socials for a wee giggle. As you would, if you encountered a game on Steam with a name that read something like "shitty/crappy dungeon" - that being the more literal translation of its accidental re-christening.</p>
<p>The reason behind the sudden switch from crazy and hyper dungeoning to crappy or shitty dungeoning? Seemingly a simple translation error, which ironically could have come as part of Italian developers Fix-a-Bug upgrading their Japanese localisation from an initial, heavily machine-done translation that had drawn criticism from players.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">こんにちは！ゲームのプログラマーです😅<br>意図したわけではないのですが、日本語では「クソダンジョン」💩になってしまいました。<br>修正中ですが…正直まだ笑っています🤭<br>遊んでみてください。本当にそんな「クソ」じゃないことを願っています ^_^<br>※この文はAI翻訳で書きました。</p>— Giorgio Macratore (@Macratore) <a href="https://twitter.com/Macratore/status/1955677253448389033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Luckily, the studio have seen the funny side of the mixup, which they've now rectified. "It wasn’t intended, but it seems the game became 'Crap Dungeon' in Japanese," programmer Giorgio Macratore wrote on the <a href="https://x.com/Macratore/status/1955677253448389033">charred remains of the Tweeter</a> - in Japanese, funnily enough. "I’m fixing it now... but honestly, I’m still laughing. Please give our game a try, I’m hoping it’s not actually crap."</p>
<p>If you want to do that last bit, there's a freshly-released demo for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/">on Steam right now</a>, with the full game set to release on October 23rd. It boasts randomly-generated labyrinths that keep switching up each run, offering you different challenges to negotiate via some turn-based combat, smart dodging, or tactical nous. It's not all serious sword and sorcery either, with some punny level names and a bloke called Armish, the wicked wizard of the 99th level. Armish may or may not serve you a riddle.</p>

            <p>Stay in cover. It's coming. THERE. You see it? A tumbleweed, the deadliest of creatures to roam the desert. Stay quiet, it might roll up on us! Well, at least we'll stand some chance of survival, thanks to a patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s devs have just put out in response to the Mesa update being deemed to damn hard.</p>
<p>If you missed this update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peaks-mesa-update-lets-you-shimmy-your-sandy-butt-up-some-sandy-buttes-adds-tornados-and-dynamite">emerging atop the release summit the other day</a>, it adds in the cannibalistic co-op climber's first new biome, offering a different challenge to the alpine cliffs folks have been scaling since the game burst onto the scene. Key to surviving this desert is not to succumb to the heat, get blown up by dynamite, or fail in your attempt to recreate Indy's boulder scene with some mobile shrubbery.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As it's turned out, though, not getting deathed by those threats is providing even harder than expected. "We’re hearing you loud and clear: the Mesa is really hard," co-publishers Aggro Crab and Landfall declare in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/537736322372077260">the notes</a> of the game's latest patch. "Part of me say...<em>good</em> suffer. But it does seem like it’s a bit unfair sometimes, so this patch is to adjust balance and fix bugs that are causing that!"</p>
<p>This brings us to the tumbling weeds. These terrifying bundles of brush now deal thorn damage instead of causing injuries, while their ability to knock you flying has been "made more consistent", and now scales based on the size of the particular tumbleweed. I'm outraged on the part of the plucky little tumbleweeds everywhere who'd been merrily punching above their weight, only to have their power sapped at the whim of Big Weedkiller.</p><p>At least they're not alone. Dynamite now spawns in luggage "slightly less often", and has been robbed of its ability to fatally blow you up through walls. Scorpions now have to be able to see you to become aggroed, have had their movement slowed a little, and "now deal less poison damage depending on how close you already are to passing out". Three more seconds of protection from fall damage has also been added to the scout cannon, and the weight of a mysteriously unnamed  <em>thing</em> has had its weight reduced, mysteriously.</p>
<p>To be fair, developers Team Peak have also helped the tumbleweeds by fixing an issue that'd stopped them from spawning. They've also fixed some problems with the kiln, in addition to disabling the rising lava in it, until they can work out how to make the heat growth sync up across every player in a party's game.</p>
<p>Right. I think the weed's tumbled on. We're clear to move out. Ahh, what's next to cl-wait, is that? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...</p>

            <p>The dawn of the second <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta weekend is here. Before it got underway, EA made a few tweaks based on feedback from last week's bout of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>ing about, with the headliners being some playlist changes and the introduction of custom match searching.</p>
<p>It's no massive reinventing of the big battlewheel, but hopefully should make a positive impact on the time folks have in this bit of the beta, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">sees the Empire State map debut</a> alongside week one's offerings. Rush and squad deathmatch modes are also joining the fray.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the great entry bell for this second beta weekend having just tolled at 9AM BST on August 14th, EA snuck out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">a post last night</a> revealing these "learnings and changes." The playlist rejigs are, I suspect, the bit you'll care most about, with the devs aiming to deliver "more variety and choice" by having more playlists rotate between different modes.</p>
<p>The example given is the All-Out Warfare playlist, which includes Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush modes for this second weekend. "Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time," EA explained. There's a full rundown of which modes you can expect in playlists at different times across the four days of the beta weekend in that post, so peruse at your leisure.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Your  participation in Battlefield 6's first Open Beta weekend across PC,  Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X|S made it a truly unforgettable  experience for the team. We're thrilled by your feedback, and are  focusing on making the October 10th launch even better.</p><p>Looking  back…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955691976130453569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The custom search feature, meanwhile, lets you pick your desired map and mode combos before you start matchmaking, with the game then endeavouring to stick you in a session that mirrors your choices. That's provided such a gun-filled Goldilocks zone is currently out there, and has a free spot. EA also insist that it's "not a server browser," thank you very much. It'll be on offer for open weapon mode playlists during the beta.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that the training grounds, an initiation mode, and a run-through of of how Rush matches work will be on offer for newbies this weekend, so no worries if this is your first chance to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>.</p>
<p>Time will tell whether the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">entry queues</a> will be a bit less huge at the outset, or that the other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-beta-been-treating-you-to-infinite-loading-screens-ea-are-on-the-case">initial teething issues</a> were all whacked on the head during that first weekend. In any case, don't forget to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">enable secure boot</a> if necessary. If it helps, picture that old DVD piracy warning blaring out the words '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">you wouldn't do a cheating</a>.'</p>

            <p>Around a week ago, <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804">146,000 people mourned the death of a horse they'd never met</a>. This might be the best single thing that has ever happened in videogames, although I don't imagine the horse would give a shit. Grass Wonder was a famous Japanese racehorse, but it's likely the majority  of those that mourned his death online are only fans of Japanese horse racing by proxy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/champion-grass-wonder-the-grandsire-of-maurice-dies-at-30">Here is an article about Grass Wonder's death</a> that does not mention <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> once. I find this profound and comforting, in the sense that it feels miraculous that such intertwined cultural spheres can still exist in their own siloes. There are people who knew Grass Wonder well, yet would look at you playing the anime horse girl game in wordless confusion, save a muttered directive that you seek the love and light of a forgiving god.</p>
<p>I'm not going to eulogise Grass Wonder because I do not care about Grass Wonder any more than I care about any other horse, and don't especially feel like pretending I do just for the sake of a bit. I think all horses are pretty good but I cannot eulogise them all. But Grass Wonder <em>is </em>special is the sense that Grass Wonder is the horse I'm currently thinking about. Grass Wonder is, as far as I'm concerned, the most famous horse in the world right now. He tramples with disdain over the frail, fallen forms of lesser attention economy aspirants, and from beyond the grave no less.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Again, we can tell from that social post linked above that Pretty Derby has inspired at least 146,000 people that I imagine would not have otherwise known about the existence, never mind death, of Grass Wonder, to spend at least some time this month thinking about his passing. I have not played <a href="https://umamusume.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Wonder">the horse girl game</a>. Perhaps it has the power to repair my relationship with my own soul, although I'm sceptical. But today, at least, it has conjured for me a reminder that fate has both a sense of humour and a penchant for Gacha mechanics. If the universe is, indeed, a machine for producing ever more potent instances of novelty, it did a fine job with the cultural impact of this racehorse's fatal organ failure.</p><p>According to the article linked above, Grass Wonder "sired 736 winners from 1327 foals". If someone in the comments could enlighten me to whether this is a misprint I would be grateful. Grass Wonder has been breeding for 25 years. If we assume the above to be true, that's about 53 kids a year, or one a week. Goliath-felling levels of mythical dick slinging, that. A real legacy, although Grass Wonder's impact on me will remain the still very notable achievement of making me think about horse dick while writing about videogames. This basically never happens. Oh, maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, actually. Weird that it happened twice, etc.</p>
