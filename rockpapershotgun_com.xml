You would think that with a game that is pretty much all about driving like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, the prospect of an update that promises "endless" driving wouldn't be all that exciting or interesting. In this case you'd be wrong, though, as the game's upcoming Endless Expeditions patch sounds like a pretty solid one. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ironwood-studios">Ironwood Studios</a> revealed the update with a new trailer yesterday, showing off all the changes and additions coming to the game, the most notable one being expeditions, described as "new continuous drives" that are a bit more dangerous than you might be used to.

Outside of offering "unique rewards", Ironwood kept quiet on what this new mode will be like, but that makes the mystery of it all the more intriguing, no? On top of that there's also a few quality of life improvements coming. There's a new feature called cluster spawning, though I couldn't tell you what that is right now. The thermal vacuum and plasma scrapper are seeing some improvements too. As well as all that, a new zone trader, Ida's Exchange, can be discovered too.

A suspend run feature is being added in too, meaning if you need to quit out of the game because you realised you forgot to file your taxes or something, you can save mid-trip and go do that without sacrificing progress.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's more cosmetics you can unlock for your garage, more than an hours worth of new music to listen to on the radio while you're on the aforementioned endless expeditions (and anywhere else), and more lore too - Ironwood described this one as their "biggest" update yet, unsurprisingly.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the update either, as it's due out in a little over a week's time on April 3rd.
