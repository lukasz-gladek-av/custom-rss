            <p>I'm sure Supermassive are going to do a perfectly respectable job with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. But, when there's two games coming out, one of which looks like a pitch-perfect spiritual sequel by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>' creators in the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reanimals">Reaminal</a>, and the other is an <em>eh</em>-looking numbered affair by a different, talented but wildly inconsistent studio, it's hard not to pick favourites. Nonetheless, Little Nightmares 3 is out on October 10th. Here's a trailer. It's too bright. Grumble.</p>

<p>Also on the same date is an enhanced edition of the original Little Nightmares (RTX, 60 FPS, 4K). In the most galaxy brained bit of publisher grasping I've encountered in some time, the actual game is fully playable right now, but only if you pre-order Little Nightmares 3. Otherwise, you can wait until October with the rest of the joyless cynics who don't want to learn about games exclusively from the people trying to sell them, before making a purchase. What are they like, eh?</p>
<p>Little Nightmares 3 itself features full co-op, although you can play solo with an AI companion. Adam Smith (RPS in peace) and Alice Bell (RPS in <a href="https://www.bookbeat.com/ro/book/the-grapples-of-wrath-1654023">new book out next year)</a> both enjoyed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-review-pc">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmares-2-review">games</a> for their "extraordinary views and grubby little rooms" (Adam) and "childhood authority figures stretched and pulled to grotesque extremes like chewing gum" (Alice).</p>
<p>Dedicated Nightheads may want to watch the entirety of <a href="https://youtu.be/oa85Ns7uegc">this week's series showcase</a>, which also included announcements for a new season of podcast The Sounds of Nightmares, a comic book named Descent To Nowhere in October, and "young adult novel" Little Nightmares: The Lonely Ones out in September.</p>
<p>Here's a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmare-studios-reanimal-is-a-creepy-co-op-adventure-inspired-by-wind-waker-and-silent-hill-2"> hands-off preview with Tarsier's (Little Nightmares I&amp;II) Reanimal</a>, which is inspired by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, according to narrative director David Mervik.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The bald man always hungers for more folks to drown in toilet water, so IO Interactive have kept feeding their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> a steady stream of post-launch targets with each entry in the World of Assassination trilogy. It sounds the devs'll be taking a similar approach with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, albeit with some Bondy twists.</p>
<p>The question is, would such regular updates scratch the itch of folks who're in it for the long haul as effectively as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jean-claude-van-damme-is-coming-to-hitman-this-week-as-a-double-crossing-ica-agent-and-its-free-to-play-for-a-month">elusive targets</a> Agent 47's been taking out on a regular basis?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>IO boss Hakan Abrak teased this being one of the "learnings from World of Assassination" that the studio may be applying to Bond in a chat with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets">The Game Business</a>. </p>
<p>"We obviously have tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players," Abrak said when asked whether First Light will follow the post-launch plan the past three Hitman games have ridden to long-term success.</p>
<p>He was keen not to get into too much detail, emphasising that IO are focused on nailing what the game has to offer at launch first, but did go on to say the following:</p>
<blockquote>With Bond, we have really upped our stealth, we have really evolved the action aspects of our technology and features. Seamless combat, coming in and out of range and melee… For Hitman, it was interlocked animations, here it is freeform. We have [players] driving different exotic cars. That gives us more challenges to play with. In Hitman, you have these live challenges. And besides the things that we are able to do in Hitman, we can do more actiony things and more kinetic challenges in Bond.</blockquote>
<p>While a lot of that is just Abrak oulining <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">the differences between how Bond and Hitman will play</a> that IO have been chatting about since the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">revealed</a>, it's the last bit that's got my attention. Hitman's elusive targets are all generally slightly different twists on the 'go somewhere, prep to kill someone, kill someone, get out' formula that the games have refined into a lethal art, with twists like no saving or restarting to spice up the challenge.</p>
<p>With Bond looking like it's much less intensely focused on just eliminating certain people, I'll be keen to see how expansive the extra challenges it offers are. I can see the likes of car chases or more straight-up shootouts being part of the equation, much like they are in the base game. Will we get longer missions that chain a number of these elements together as post-launch extras, will IO opt to just add them as individual challenges so it can drop new stuff more often, or a mix of both?</p>
<p>I'd prefer the former, but it might not be as efficient development-wise as the elusive targets have proven to be - something Abrak notes IO are so keen on that they've stopped making as many new toilets in their games. Plus, we'll have to see if the Bond formula, with its glitzy Hollywood sheen in contrast to Hitman's darkly hilarious murder experimentation, lends itself as well to keeping a game feeling fresh once that initial surge of interest runs its course.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I love fishing in games. I already went over this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-fishing-is-a-horror-fishing-sim-with-only-one-goal-reel-in-the-one-thing-that-was-never-meant-to-be-found">last week with Out Fishing</a>, so I won't repeat myself much more. But I do desperately need to tell you about FISH³, or FISH³: FISHTASTIC FISHING FISHSCAPES, a very unconventional fishing game that's also an arcade time trial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a>, where the fish you catch are also your boat's engine, and you can fish while you're racing? If, like me, that entire description has you thinking "come again", then read on.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how it works. Levels start off with you catching a fish, which involves moving your analogue sticks (controller only it seems, sorry mouse and keyboard diehards) into particular spots and hitting L2 and R2 to build up some meter to catch it. The racing part itself is akin to something like Wave Race 64, with ramps and nets to give you boosts and get in your way along the course.

<p>
What really makes the whole experience strange is that while you try to navigate a course, you can also catch more fish, because you actually have two fishing rods. This then presents a single analogue stick version of the same minigame, though this one requires more specific timing as you have to hit R2 at the same time as an arrow that's spinning around in a circle.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be clear: FISH³, in its current state, is jank as hell. I had a go at the demo and it is a sensory overload to start off with. And yet, I'm also incredibly fascinated by it. Like many arcade racers, you have target times and scores to beat, the former potentially hindered by you taking too long to reel in more fish (and other things), the latter bolstered by catching lots of fish (and other things).
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely the foundation of a special, but very odd, arcade game in there, one that I can see the biggest of sickos figuring out strats most of us will only be able to enjoy through clips on TikTok. I'm quite looking forward to seeing how it shapes up, and if you are too, then you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3641250/FISH_FISHTASTIC_FISHING_FISHSCAPES/">here</a>.
