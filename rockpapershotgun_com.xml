            <p>Yes, yes, I'm opting for the scoundrel's gambit and reporting on a Reddit post. Of a self-imposed challenge run, no less! But I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">adored the bejeezus</a> out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and figured this was worth sharing in case it convinces a couple of you to give it a go. Redditor HunterIV4 has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1ki94qi/can_you_beat_the_game_without_dodging_yes_part_2/">chronicled their journey</a> to beat the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> without dodging, parrying, or even using the powerful gradient parries, in a bid to show that Sekiro reflexes aren't as crucial to success as they might seem. Thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-player-tanks-their-way-through-the-entire-game-without-dodging-or-parrying-to-prove-a-point-you-can-finish-it-without-gamer-reflexes/">cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer</a>.</p>

<p>Tackling the game's story mode, HunterIV4 took the approach of bumping up their party's health as much as possible. It sounds like they had a fairly easy time through the game's first act, although they had to focus more heavily on effective builds for the latter portion. Personally, I enjoyed the buildcraft in Clair Obscur so much it's been a little disheartening to see it overshadowed by the Sekiro comparisons and what not. I do think this is partially a quirk of the design, since you can technically make the character building meaningless by just getting very good at button pressing. Still: good to hear that it does have the capacity to play like a more traditional turn-base 'em up.</p>
<p>HunterIV4 ended the second of their two posts with screenshots of both final bosses beaten with zero parries or  dodges. "Don't let concerns about a 'hardcore' experience prevent you from playing this awesome game and experiencing the story first-hand," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kfc7mz/no_dodgeparry_an_experiment_and_what_to_do_if_you/">they wrote</a>. "Despite the hype, this is not <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>."</p>
<p>Granted, this doesn't sound like the best way to experience the game - Act I took them much longer that they'd have like, apparently. But, hopefully it's tempted a few more of you to join the cult of Esquie's magnificent ass. The time of the airship is over, now is the age of the dump truck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
