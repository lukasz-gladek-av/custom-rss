            <p>The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/love-eternal">Love Eternal</a> is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".</p>
<p>When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Commendably harrowing, yes? Celeste meets Silent Hill is one framing - Gris but grimdark is another. I already know I'm going to struggle with the platforming, but I'm very curious about the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>'s bottomless sokoban-scape. I also like the treacherousness of the presentation, with larger animated sprites suddenly louring into view during the hop-and-bop sequences. I like it up to a point, anyway. If the game does the fourth-wall peekaboo routine every time I have to carry out six mid-air gravity flips in a row, I am going to get Cross.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of features from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gorgeous hand-drawn pixel art graphics bring the god's realm to life alongside meticulously handcrafted animations boasting many thousands of frames</p>
<p>A lush, atmospheric score, equal parts unsettling and beautiful</p>
<p>Responsive, snappy controls provide challenges with a sense of mastery and acrobatic accomplishment</p>
<p>A psychological horror narrative contorts and unfolds to reveal choices beyond comprehension</p></blockquote>
<p>Love Eternal is out in 2025. For pretty much the exact tonal opposite of this, may I recommend Ed's recent favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now">Stardust Demon</a>? Fans of bizarro 2D games are eating well this October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
