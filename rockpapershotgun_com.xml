Today I became aware of Bolt Action, a historical strategy sim based on the World War II tabletop miniatures game from Warlord Games (founded by erstwhile Games Workshop staffers John Stallard and Paul Sawyer). It sees you fretting over questions of morale, line-of-sight and cover, while leading US, British or German armies across maps that range from beaches to churchyards. There’s multiplayer, too. Trailer ho!

In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3856030/view/541128612120628420?l=english">a blogpost this week</a>, developers Frag Games simultaneously announce their desire to do right by the source material while making clear that they don’t want to just transplant it, Victoria Crosses and all.  “We’ve all seen ‘PC adaptations’ that strip the soul out of a tabletop game to make it ‘accessible,’" they sneer, like grown men disproving the existence of Santa Claus. “So our designers spent weeks in ‘boot camp’: reading rulebooks, painting minis, rolling dice, measuring distances with tape, and feeling the genuine panic of a FUBAR roll.
</p>
<p>
“We learned a lot, and we’re still learning,” it continues. “But the one thing we DID know from the beginning was that we didn’t want to build a digital version of Bolt Action.  Bolt Action already exists! Playing a table-top experience will always remain special. What we want is the best Turn-Based Tactics videogame built on the Bolt Action ruleset.”</p>
<p>There follows a breakdown of the “six tactical choices” that await you whenever you pick a unit: firing, advancing, running, ambushing (aka overwatch), rallying (aka getting rid of suppression “pins”), and going prone. 
</p>
<p>
Another section explores vehicles, which are proof against small arms and have a selection of armour facings. There’s a bit on how indirect fire works, with the accuracy of consecutive shots on a target improving each turn, and a bit on platoon experience levels, upgrades and customisation.
</p><p>
It looks like a tidy little wargame – no release date yet - but that’s not why I’ve written it up. “We’re building a game for the person with five unpainted armies sitting on their shelf, but also for the strategy fan who wants a WWII game with complex rules and deep gameplay,” the devs comment near the end of that blogpost.</p>
<p>The mention of unpainted armies fills my heart with decades-old guilt – alas, Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth, I never did get round to finishing your cape – but also, <em>possibility</em>. Adaptations of tabletop miniatures games often come with elaborate livery editors, but now that I reflect, I’m not sure I’ve played one that lets you show up to the brawl with an unpainted force.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a while since I wielded a physical range ruler, but there is surely no better way to demonstrate your contempt for an opponent - and maybe, throw them off - than by rocking up with some High Elves you couldn’t be bothered to basecoat, let alone shade and layer. Imagine if Henry V came to Agincourt with no pants. How might the French have reacted? Clarification: I have not researched the Battle of Agincourt, so apologies if going commando was, in fact, a critical element of the English strategy. 
</p>
<p>
Less abrasively, I just think miniatures adaptations could do a better job of reflecting the fact that a lot of miniatures collectors aren’t great painters, however enthusiastic. There should be an editor function that recreates the effect of a spirited 10-year-old getting Warhammer for Xmas and trying to pimp out a whole Lizardman battalion in felt tip. I think this could be wholesome? Authentic, even?

            <p>
Against the overbearing weight of modernity, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> continues to complete a Sisyphean task of simply existing two and a half decades after it originally launched. It just celebrated that 25th anniversary at the start of the year in fact, and now during a Winter Summit a slew of updates coming to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> were shown off in a roadmap from developer Jagex.
</p>
<p>
Kicking things off on the roadmap is Deadman: Annihilation, a "high intensity, PvP everywhere" variation on its main PvP mode that'll run from January 30th through to February 21st. This one'll feature some new sigils and breaches, and you can earn points to pick up cosmetics. Following that, in April Leagues is returning with Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts, complete with bonus XP drops and loot boosts, alongside some reimagined combat masteries.

Sailing, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/old-school-runescape-is-getting-its-first-new-skill-since-it-launched-and-so-the-xp-grind-begins-anew">first new skill since it changed from regular RuneScape to Old School RuneScape</a>, will be expanded upon sometime in 2026 too, namely new quests to do. Those of you that have been around for a long time will be interested to hear about the Blood Moon Rises update coming in the summer, a Grandmaster-tier quest that'll wrap up a story started all the way back in 2004. Jeepers creepers! Pull out the champagne for that questline. On top of all that, there's also The Fractured Archive, the game's first new raid in four years.
</p>
<p>
As always I'm just impressed this thing is trucking. It's the first online anything where I had an actual username (no I'm not telling you, some things are best kept as secrets), those types of internet histories are typically lost to time. Kudos!

            <p>A group of modders wearing the finest reverse-engineering goggles has managed to port birdly and beary platformer Banjo-Kazooie to PC, with a bunch of extra bells and whistles to make sure it won't make for a disappointing dip back into your childhood or adulthood. Their creation's dubbed Banjo: Recompiled, and it dropped over the weekend.</p>

<p>This recompiled version of the N64 classic, brought to life using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>, is primarily the work of modder Wiseguy. It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, provided you bring along the game files via a legally-sourced ROM of the North American 1.0 version.</p>
<p>If you do, you're in for a version of Banjo which offers a bunch of helpful features designed to ensure it's ideal to play on today's hardware, though it is also promised to run on more potato-shaped boxes. There's support for high framerates if you don't fancy leaving it at a solid 60, widescreen and ultrawide modes, and rapid loading times. A dual-analog camera steup, the ability to keep your notes if you die or exit a level, and support for playing on Steam Deck are also part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Finally, there's built-in mod support in case you want to get Doom running in the jigsaw minigame. Or just download the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLzv0U3cFlo">Jiggies of Time</a> and or a revamped texture pack.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a project that looks well worth the wait of eons for Banjo to get a proper PC port, something Microsoft haven't yet deigned worth digging back into the nostalgia toybox to whip out.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving Banjo: Recompiled a go, you'll find it and its souce code on <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GitHub</a>, where Wiseguy also notes they're planning on delivering ray tracing to it at some point down the line.</p>
