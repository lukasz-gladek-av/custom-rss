            <p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is wonderful for that plumber guy, but mostly meant piss all for us PC people. The thing is, this version of the game actually comes with some new stuff, and I like new stuff, and publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> only vaguely said all the new bits would be coming to "other platforms". But! I bring good news, as yes, the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition extras are coming to PC as part of a Tarnished Pack DLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This comes from the first FromSoftware Games Event Spring 2025, held earlier today, which <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a> covered and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others">RPG Site</a> kindly extrapolated details from. Now, to be clear, there aren't many details, but something is better than nothing. For one, there'll be a total of four new armour sets to acquire. On top of that there's two new starting classes, Knight of Ides, and Heavy Armored Knight, both of which are, you guessed it, knights! Not particularly exciting given that there's already some knight options, but what can you do? These two knights make up two of the four new armour sets.
</p>
<p>
You'll also have a total of three new looks for your trusty steed Torrent, which I suppose is more than the none you could choose from before. Apparently some more weapons and skills are being added into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> too. At the very least, FromSoftware did say that the DLC pack will be cheap for those not on Switch 2, though I am a bit surprised this isn't just coming in the form of a free update.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is cross our fingers that that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Not Bloodborne 2 But It's Basically Bloodborne 2 Except It's An Online Game game The Duskbloods</a> comes to PC eventually too.

Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sims</a> already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-seikyu">Tales of Seikyu</a>, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/">early access on Steam</a> this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there).

The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute!
</p>
<p>
There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's "secrets." I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.

While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> is obviously quite busy presumably stressing over lukewarm responses to its next game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, they're still working on a bunch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> stuff. The studio revealed a plethora of expansions today, all of which are building up a new "multi-year saga" called the Fate Saga. We'll get to it in a moment, but one of these expansions might raise an eyebrow, as it is quite literally a Star Wars crossover, but is also described by narrative designer Alison Luhrs as one that will push the Fate Saga "forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, let's talk about the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIAAxlbFujk&amp;ab_channel=Destiny2">The Edge of Fate</a>. This one's out quite soon, July 15th, where you'll be heading to a planetoid called Kepler to "redefine our future." You'll be facing off against Fallen Corsairs and Vex Kobolds on Kepler, and you can get new abilities by binding your guardian to dark matter. On top of that, there's a bunch of new modifiers, armour is getting an update to include set bonuses and reworked stats, and gear can progress up to five tiers.

<p>
Then, there's the second expansion, Renegades. Here you'll find the Star Wars stuff, which includes you rocking a lightsaber, alongside some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJUdSgTuSMs/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous cosmetics</a>. Honestly, this one stinks a bit. I'm a bit sick of Star Wars by now, and I already think that Destiny having any crossovers at all ruins the vibe, but for it to be a whole, important expansion that'll inevitably get vaulted? Come off it. If you're not as put off as I am, this one is due out December 2.

After that there's a couple more expansions to come too, one called Shattered Cycle out summer 2026, and the other being The Alchemist in winter 2026. You might notice that that's two expansions a year, which certainly is a lot, but there's big questions as to whether that'll be enough to bring people back. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has struggled quite a bit in recent years, not to mention the fact that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">down by a lot of staff</a> compared to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">couple of years ago</a>, so this certainly feels like a push to get back on track. Fingers crossed for the team more than anything else.
