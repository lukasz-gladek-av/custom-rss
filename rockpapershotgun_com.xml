            Back in 2022, Sin began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-terra-invicta-is-too-much-for-one-article-and-possibly-one-lifetime">her impressions</a> of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> with the comment that "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live."
</p><p>Further down the page there are horrifying phrases like "makes Europa Universalis seem limited" and "every planet and moon and asteroid, all orbiting in real time", woven through a fascinating account of a game that is sort of XCOM, but you're organising a whole Earth's worth of competing countries and factions to repel solar system invaders who may not even materialise for dozens of hours. But <em>of course</em> Hooded Horse are publishing it. This was one of their first signings, I believe. Those sickos.</p>

<p>The hour of reckoning is nigh. Developers Pavonis Interactive have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1176470/view/599669316683563056?l=english">just released</a> the last major Terra Invicta update before the 1.0 release, which is still undated. The update adds 50 new Early regions, a starting scenario in 2070 that skips you forward to the maturation of interplanetary travel technologies, various AI and performance improvements, and the ability to mount an expedition to the asteroid Apophis in the year 2029, this being when that 20 million tonne boulder will next pass close to Earth.</p>
<p>The creators of Terra Invicta appear hell-bent on representing the real-life status and likely development of space tech, geopolitics and the motions of celestial bodies. The 1.0 release will add a 2026 scenario "with the world situation updated to the present day". This meticulousness prompts the worry that perhaps there <em>is</em> an alien invasion underway and this game is secretly an interface for the actual global resistance. Are you doing an Ender's Game on us, Pavonis? Because I should not be allowed within three lightyears of any command bunker. I'm the guy who forgets which character he is in fighting games.</p>
<p>Here's a full bulletpoint rundown of the 1.0 update.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>More than 50 new regions on Earth, along with new nations, breakaways, and formables, along with new mechanics for region annexation and federations. We also updated Earth's boost values for the 2022 scenario to match Earth's actual launch capabilities during that year.</li>
<li>The "2070" scenario, in which interplanetary travel has been achieved and all factions start with some space assets already built. Many nations on Earth are consolidated into regional powers with the intent to create greater balance between their stats and initial capabilities, so there are lots of strategies on Earth and in space to explore.</li>
<li>A "realistic" combat mode in which ships are closer to their actual size and propellant consumption at high acceleration increases dramatically. The older mode is still available and now called "cinematic" combat so you can play how you like!</li>
<li>New hab modules, including solar mirrors to support solar power on surface habs on Mars, asteroids, and Jupiter, spy modules to give bonuses to the oppression priority and detecting enemy councilors on Earth, and climate modules that give bonuses to the environment priority.</li>
<li>A bunch of new events, including "Peace Dividend," where nations without rivals can trade military capability for economic benefits; "Officer's Insight," where a high-ranking ship officer can propose faction-wide improvements, and "Apophis Passage," where the passing of this near-Earth asteroid in 2029 offers the opportunity to mount an expedition for scientific advancements.</li>
<li>Some new projects, including three faction-specific projects for each faction, as well as some that improve Earth-based research. Also consolidated many national independence projects.</li>
<li>An updated tutorial!</li>
<li>UI updates galore, including a new org manager to manage your councilors' orgs all in one place.</li>
<li>Smarter AI on Earth and in space.</li>
<li>Performance improvements, bugfixes, and balance changes across the board. Buffs to particle weapons, hybrid and exotic armor, and earlier access to plasma weapons. Most ship hulls gained a utility slot as batteries became a completely optional module.</li>
<li>10 new achievements! We'll let you discover what they are.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear more about the revised tutorial and UI. In her 2022 write-up, Sin noted that it was often hard to know what to do, and not just because "there's just so much STUFF and so little capacity to pursue 95% of it that it largely becomes background noise." Beyond that, I have a terrible urge to play this but haha haahahaa ahaaa, I'm not going to review it. I can't even dry my towels correctly, let alone get my spies in order. Don't try to make me review Terra Invicta, Julian. I will scream.</p>

            <p>It's been tradition for as long as anyone can remember, that the team at RPS ends the year by choosing their favourite 24 games from the preceding 12 months. In December, we reveal our picks day-by-day. We call this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/advent-calendar">the RPS Advent Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>It's also been tradition that our readers, the inveterate gamblers that they are, bet on what games we're going to pick. Crawling through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">our reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">'What are we all playing this weekend?' posts</a>, and social media ramblings to gain insights to our picks. I swear last night I saw the face of a commenter at my kitchen window, scanning the room for evidence of my choices. Thank goodness, all they saw was evidence of my tightly regimented batchcooking process.</p>
<p>This year will mark the thirteenth year of the RPS Advent Calendar Guessing Game. If it were a child, it could now legally create a social media account and message abuse at the RPS team for including a game in the advent calendar which we didn't review or even write about at any point in the previous 12 months. It's an incredible effort by the event's organiser Aerothorn and a genuine joy to see everyone getting involved.</p>
<p>To take part in the contest, you need to head over to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">the RPS Discord server</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/152113064727150594/1434625053642854433">join the #2025-advent-calendar-guessing-game channel</a>. There you will find a thread where you can submit your guesses. The first post in the channel contains the full rules, but I'll liberally copy and paste the key ones below:</p><p>"On December 1st, Horace will emerge from his den and reveal to us one of the greatest PC games of 2025. He will do this for 24 days, on the final day revealing the Bestest Best game of the year. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict which twenty-four games will be selected.</p>
<p>"In the Entries thread, post a list of the 24 games that you think will feature on the RPS Advent Calendar. Specify which game is Day 24, aka the Bestest Best Game. This is the first tiebreaker. The order of the rest doesn’t matter."</p>
<p>[The second second tiebreaker question is: “How many of the Advent Calendar picks didn't receive a review on RPS?” We're looking for an officially labeled review - not a news story, supporter post, etc."]</p>
<p>"You get a point for every pick that appears on the calendar. At the end of the competition, the person with the most points wins, the second-most is the runner-up, and the third-most is the runner-up runner-up. In the event of a tie, we’ll use the following tiebreakers:</p>
<p>"The individual who correctly guessed the Bestest Best game is the winner.</p>
<p>"If both/neither leaders guessed the Bestest Best game, the person with the closest guess for the second tiebreaker will win.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is still a tie, we’ll have extra prizes for the winners."</p>
<p>What's that? Prizes?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>12 month RPS sub for 1st place</li>
<li>6 month RPS sub for 2nd place</li>
<li>3-month RPS sub for 3rd place</li>
</ul>
<p>Some added details to help you make your picks.</p>
<p>Everyone on the RPS team votes. So this year, that means me, Callum, Edwin, James, Jeremy, Mark, and Ollie. We all privately pick ten games, ordering them from first to last. The game in first place is worth ten points, second place is worth nine, and so on, with tenth place being worth one point. I then add them all to a spreadsheet, add up the totals for each game, and the top 24 games become our advent calendar for that year. (Though, we don't publish them in score order, except for the game revealed on December 24th – that's what we consider to be the Bestest Best game of the year).</p><p>To be eligible for this year's RPS Advent Calendar, a game needs to have been released or received a significant update in the past 12 months. This also means that games which are in early access are in the running. We sometimes pick games from the previous December because we had already closed that year's voting at the point they came out.</p>
<p>This year will be particularly hard to guess as we have seen significant changes in the team. I only joined in October, for instance, and the game I've written most about is Wall World 2 – and not especially positively.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, all the guessers will be in the same boat, and in previous years, the winner has often done it by getting less than 60% of their guesses right.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> is getting another new class, revealed last night as the Hive Scum. They’re a suitably skull-adorned outlaw who can dual-wield guns or shivs, while indulging in a cheeky bit of chemical warfare by homebrewing stimulants and lacing their weapons with harmful chems. Basically the opposite of the space-narc Arbites class added this summer, then: they got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">exploding dogs</a>, the Hive Scum gets exploding drugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They’re not joining Darktide’s co-op raids until December 2nd, but in the meantime, developers Fatshark have detailed pretty much all their dirty tricks in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1p0hejn/dev_blog_hive_scum_class_design_talents/">Reddit blog</a>. There’s also this teaser trailer, showing off the akimbo shootering and a new crowbar weapon in CGI action.</p> <figure>

<p>According to the dev blog, the Hive Scum looks to complement the existing roster of melee fiends and ranged specialists by performing as a slippery up-close gunslinger – hence being able to double up on quick-firing but less accurate pistols. They’ve also got a choice of unlockable skills geared around sustaining high-risk, close quarters play, with the option to specialise in either shooting or shanking.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <em>controlled substances</em> element. This covers remixes of existing tools, like the Chem Grenade or Chem Toxin: a stackable damage-over-time effect, similar to the existing burning or bleeding modifiers. But it also extends to an entirely new Stimm Lab mechanic wherein Hive Scummers can, by investing skill points (not unlike the main talent tree), create their own injectable Stimms with customised effects. There’s even a Combat Ability in the main tree that lets nearby teammates share the high, an interaction that I desperately hope will trigger anguished, violently guilt-ridden screams of confusion from the Arbites.</p><p>I may have been slightly underwhelmed, watching that trailer for the first time – 40K is ripe with the likes of ancient cyborgs, Hobbit-sized drunken snipers, and half-goat militiamen, none of whom would turn down a scrap with Chaos and all of whom might have made a more interesting addition to the crew than Florida Woman here. I do like the ferocious sound of the Hive Scum playstyle, though, especially after months of maining the methodical Emprah Cop.</p>

The Rock Paper Shotgun CMS groaned like a harpooned whale when I fed the above game title into our database. I was tempted to shave away some punctuation for the benefit of whoever writes about this game next, but then I remembered that I hate everybody here as I do hell, all Montagues, and thee. Anyway, what a title. It's like Type Moon and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> fell into a cyberpunk snakepit.</p>
<p>I don't even know what half the characters are called. They appear malevolently polarised, pushing other letters away from them. They seem... primordial somehow. Our distant ancestors used to hack brackets like those into the walls of caverns, when they wished to add inessential tips about flint storage to paintings of hunters getting tusked by mammoths.

The game beneath is appropriately arcane. Devised by <a href="https://dark-union.org/">The Dark Union</a> - whose official website resounds with monastic chanting and has an About page containing doomy philosophical maxims about bees - it's a third-person "story-driven stealth action immersive sim" in which you play a holy alchemist, Auronika Cortez.</p><p>Her goal is to topple the rulers of a rainy, "medieval-industrial" world of tunnels and ramparts prowled by soldiers brandishing crystal rifles. Your principle weapon is your ability to fashion bits of trash into potions and bombs. The bombs are <em>exceedingly</em> explosive. This is not one of those shooters where you hop back a few paces back after lobbing some C4 at a cave-in. You park your butt behind a nice thick wall. 
</p>
<p>
The demo on Steam leaves me mixed about the cleverness of the immersive simming - I spent a lot of time crouching and running away from guttural guard chatter - but I love the A.E.S.T.H.E.T.I.C. This includes what are probably very strenously observed "technical limitations". The intro cinematic yearns for an era in FMV when developers might luxuriate in the spectacle of individual hair follicles but had yet to animate them. In-game, I was pleased to find that I could back into a corner and poke the camera through my character's skull, to see her pasted-on face from the inside. Kids these days will never understand such delights.
</p>
<p>
Your health gauge is a clump of glaring cybermetal, screwed into the bottom right corner, while item and status notifications clatter down a feed on the left. The setting is a sparsely populated, palpably inhuman undulation of brute grey boxes and pyramids. And then there's the splendid crafting screen. It sees you assembling components inside a wavering ball of energy on a curved wireframe, then drawing a glyph. An aetherial circle plus metal and plastic nets you some bomb components. Add the components to more metal and plastic plus a curvy star glyph, and you'll produce a "basic bomb" capable of dusting a cathedral.
</p>
<p>
It's tentatively slated to release next year. The premise and emphasis on freeform building destruction here remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-faction-guerrilla">Red Faction Guerrilla</a>, though being the work of a much smaller team, this isn't nearly as granular in its devastation. I doubt it needs to be that granular, and it's not just a sneaky teardown sim, in any case: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503810/TERRORtypeALCHEMY/?curator_clanid=45029635">Steam</a> page promises a "story of resistance, redemption, and the price of freedom as Auronika must navigate between her heavenly mandate and the brutal realities of uprising."

            <p>Sometimes things happen that you can't control. That's now been the case for developers Permadeath and their 2D sandbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/385380/Planet_Centauri/">Planet Centauri</a> twice on Steam, with first a wishlist bug and more recently the reveal of Valve's new hardware landing at just the right time to make the devs' task of getting eyeballs on their game more challenging than it would normally be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/planet-centauri-steam-machine-announcement-valve-daily-deal-sale/">Polygon</a>, Planet Centauri's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/385380/view/519699831627710608?l=english">1.0 launch</a> in December last year saw it run into what its developers were later informed by Valve to be "a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent". Oof. Valve, to their credit, did offer Permadeath a make-good in the form of having the game pop up as one of Steam's daily deals, which the steamy storerunners hoped would "help make up for lost visibility" from that launch day bug.</p>
<p>The studio were reportedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/">initially hesitant</a> to take up the offer, but ended up picking November 12th from a selection of dates Valve offered. That day rolled around and boom: Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">announced</a> a new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame VR headset. Naturally, Valve switched up the Steam storefront to blare that big news front and centre, making it much more difficult than usually might be the case for any deals or sales to stick out and catch folks' attention.</p>
<p>Laurent Lechat, one of Planet Centauri's devs, says they've had to chalk this up to yet another instance of "bad luck". They know they couldn't have expected Valve to offer a heads up by blabbing their big Steam device news to the studio ahead of time. "The day was chosen more or less randomly on our end," Lechat said. There's perhaps an argument that, depending on when it locked in that date for the big reveals, Valve could have blocked out the 12th as a no-go zone for deals, so whichever games might have been in line to be featured during it didn't end up in a battle they'd not expect.</p><p>Though, Permadeath's devs make clear that they did still get some traction out of the daily deal, despite the tough eyeball competition. A little over 5,000 copies shifted on that day, which is less than the studio hoped and apparently less than the bump in coverage when the news of the bug affecting Planet Centauri's 1.0 launch netted them when it broke a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Despite that, Lechat stressed that these sales will still aid in the studio's efforts to keep on trucking, saying: "what seems like a small amount will be a great help because it's enough for us to survive for at least a year and allow us to finish our second game, which is currently in development." That game's a 2D roguelike which'll be getting a demo when it's ready and won't be following Planet Centauri's early access path.</p>
<p>What the latter's fate in terms of further updates ends up being depends on how well its fresher sibling does. Permadeath aren't against returning to it, even if Lechat understandably has "the feeling that Planet Centauri is cursed" given just how much fun it's run into over the past year and a bit.</p>
