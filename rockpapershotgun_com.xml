            <p>May Horace save and protect you, my fellow Metamedia Sorcerers, for I come with bad tidings. We are entering a news-lull. While there are some curious, possibly even attention-worthy PC games out this week, none of them are Big. None of them have that triple, quadruple or possibly even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">quintuple-A bullshit frosting</a> the Maw so delights to batten upon. Last week gave us Tokyo Game Show, a time of relative bounty, but this week, there is a dearth of obvious headline material, and the Creature is already showing signs of discontent.</p>
<p>Its guts stiffen and strain like paralysed icebreakers. Its eyes widen in every mirror. How could it get worse? Oh hell's teeth, I've run out of coffee. We're doomed! Rohan has deserted us! Theoden has betrayed me! Abandon your posts! Flee, flee for your lives!
</p><!--more-->
<p>I don't have a Gandalf to stride in here, whack me with a staff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=267nNfzyL5E">rally the troops</a>. James would have played the part, I'm sure, but he's not in today. Perhaps he's out buying coffee. Please let that be the case. Also, please let somebody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buy EA or equivalent</a> so that we have a chunky morsel to appease the beast, before it ruptures the continuum and turns Mars into Belgium again. Casting my gaze wildly at the events calendar, I see only the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events?year=2025">GamesIndustry.biz HR Summit 2025</a> on 2nd October. I can't feed HR people to the Maw! After all, they're vitally needed for approving my holidays. Please, let somebody post a link to something straightforwardly huge in the comments. While you scrape around for ideas, here's the latest new game round-up.
</p>
<h2>Monday 29th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862550/Bonapartes_Bluff/">Boneparte's Bluff</a> is a free and simple-looking abstract strategy game in which the pieces lie to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 30th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is a revamp of the venerable PS1 strategy RPG. Dom over at Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">says it's pretty good</a>.</li>
<li>It seems likely you're in the mood for xenomorphs, after Alien: Earth, so maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>'s Evolved Edition (pictured), the new headset-free version of a VR horror game that is apparently a bit mid.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1969370/LEGO_Party/">LEGO Party!</a> is a four-player minigame bonanza with an unnecessary and frankly condescending exclamation mark. People should know well enough to supply their own dang exclamation marks when they play "party" games.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 1st October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">Flick Solitaire</a> is a solo card game with a lot of decks from different artists. It's free-to-play and launching in early access. There are in-app purchases and season passes, but "all core gameplay, collecting decks, and completing them can be experienced for free". A suspicious CTRL+F of the Steam page reveals no mention of NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 2nd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Éalú</a> is an atmospheric puzzler with hand-made, stop-motion animations. It's about a wooden mouse trying to escape a maze.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> is a monster-taming RPG about those collectible creatures who aren't Pokemon and also aren't currently being sued for trying to be Pokemon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 3rd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3386900/Castle_of_Heart_Retold/">Castle Of Heart: Retold</a> is a prettied-up version of a lush Slavic side-scroller in which a knight must continuously murder vodniks to stop his body turning to stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's your cue. Fill me in on any important breaking news, or major games releases not mentioned here. Please, I beg of you. I'm literally writing this from inside the Mawmouth, peering out at you through a forest of quantum strings as thick as baleen. It smells awful in here. I'm sitting on a rancid chunk of Borderlands DLC, attempting to wipe the kaiju dribble off my laptop screen. Time to test out this Boneparte Bluff game, I guess, while Mark embarks on an emergency expedition to locate any massive standalone mods we've forgotten about.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been over half a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-next-patch-come-with-first-bits-dlc-team-folon-celebrates-becoming-registered-business">announced that it'd be getting three bits of DLC</a> adding new quests to post-apocalyptic Blighty. The folks behind the massive mod have been relatively quiet in that time, but they've now confirmed that the first of these DLCs, Rabbit and Pork, will require you to start a fresh save game.</p>
<p>Also, one reason it hasn't arrived already is that the team have been working to ensure other quest add-ons won't force you to go back to square one, whenever they drop.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC is a DLC in name only really, it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content," Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter wrote on Team FOLON's<a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1233281020376252417/1421047996292005960">Discord server</a> over the weekend, in response to a user asking if they'd have to start over again when the DLC arrives. "So, it'll require a new save. One of the reasons it's also [taken] so long was ensuring any future groundwork for other quests in other DLCs won't require the new game save."</p>
<p>A fresh save being mandatory for at least the first of the three Fallout: London DLCs isn't a huge surprise. Since the mod first started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">updates and patches to fix bugs</a> last year, Team FOLON's advice for the best experience has been to start a new game each time a new version arrives, with carrying on from an established one being doable, but potentially leading you to run into "compatibility issues".</p><p>The possibility of messing with saves was what led the modders to roll Fallout: London's bug-fixing version 1.03 patch, originally teased late last year, into this upcoming first DLC. Given that, it's really encouraging to hear the modders have been working on ways to minimise the impact future updates'll have in this regard, since starting over in such a huge game every time it gets updated is far from ideal.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from this first DLC, Rabbit and Pork, Team FOLON's 2D art lead Emily ‘Saffron-rice’ Kemp wrote in a Discord exchange with another fan immediately following Carter's that DLC number one will include "various new side quests of different sizes, but no main quest content".</p>
<p>We do know that extra main questing will be coming in Fallout: London's third DLC, Wildcard, which looks to be the final one the modders have planned at the moment. As Carter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">revealed in an interview with me for my old home</a> last year, that DLC'll add in a whole New Vegas-style wild card arc for the game's main quest, which'll let you decide the fate of London without having to side with the three established main quest factions: Angel, Camelot, and the Fifth Column. This questline was originally intended to be in the base game, but had to be cut after the modder taking the lead on it was, in Carter's words, "basically forcibly conscripted" into the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>That leaves the second DLC, Last Orders, which very much looks pub-themed based on its name and the accompanying art. I'll be keen to give each of them a go, and all the better if I can get away without starting fresh three or four times in the process.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: Well, that escalated quickly. Following rumours over the weekend, EA have confirmed that an investor consortium consisting of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners have acquired the Battlefield 6 publisher in an all-cash transaction that values EA at around $55 billion. The consortium will buy 100% of EA and take it private, with the PIF rolling in their existing 9.9% stake in the publisher.
</p>
<p>EA have put out <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">a press release</a> featuring various hyperbolic remarks from the likes of EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will stay on in his position. EA will also continue to be based in Redwood City, California. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2027 - in other words, at some point between January and March, once it has been granted the usual regulatory approvals and voted through by EA's shareholders. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>According to the press release, the transaction consititutes "an equity investment of approximately $36 billion" from PIF, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, plus "$20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close". 
</p>
<p>So there you have it: one of the oldest North American videogame household names still kicking, now privately owned after three decades on the market. The press release doesn't, as you're probably expecting, address how this will affect ordinary EA employees and subsidiary developers, or address any concerns they might have about their workplace being co-owned by Saudi Arabia's investment wing. For more on that, read this morning's initial reporting on rumours of the acquisition, below.
</p>
<p><em>Original story from 29th September follows:</em></p>
<p>Battlefield, EA Sports FC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> publishers Electronic Arts are holding "advanced talks" to go private with a valuation of $50 billion after 35 years as a public company, according to reports this weekend.
</p>
<p>If rumour breathe true, the buyers are a group of investors that include private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Affinity Partners, the Saudi-backed investment firm founded by Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
</p>
<p>The report comes via the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, the latter of whom cite "sources familiar with the matter". They claim that if the deal goes through, it could happen this week.

<p><em>If</em> the deal does happen, it will mean that BioWare, Criterion Games, DICE, Motive Studio, and Respawn Entertainment are now partly overseen by the investment arm of a state that oppresses women and queer people, executes journalists and imprisons political dissenters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> developers may find the prospect especially unwelcome, given the focus their games place on diverse casts.

<p>Reuters frame the investments as part of Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030" strategy to diversify the Kingdom's heavily oil-reliant economy. The PIF were rumoured to be discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">a $2 billion investment deal</a> via their subsidiary Savvy Games with the infamously acquisition-happy Embracer Group some years ago. These talks reportedly fell through in May 2023, triggering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">a brutal period of mass layoffs and cancellations</a>. 
</p>
<p>More recently, the PIF acquired Scopely, US publishers of licensed games like Marvel Strike Force and the current developers of Pokemon Go. They have also funded the creation of a new Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in the historic city of AlUla, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">prompting internal criticism from Ubisoft developers</a>.
</p><p>In addition to investing in games publishers, the PIF have poured a lot of money into esports, acquiring companies and hosting tournaments in what has been widely styled a case of 'sportswashing' <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">the Kingdom's abysmal human rights record</a>. Earlier this month, the Public Investment Fund-backed company Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">became co-owner of fighting game tournament Evo</a>. Savvy Games already own ESL FACEIT Group, a merger of two esports organisers, who are organising next year's much-trumpeted Esports World Cup in Riyadh.
</p>
<p>As for the other two investment groups who are allegedly party to the EA deal, Silver Lake are a 1999-founded firm who once owned Skype, and who have also sunk a few doubloons into game engine company Unity and PC manufacturer Dell. Affinity Partners were founded by Kushner in 2021, and have received billions from the PIF, with Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman personally intervening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">push the investment through</a>. Kushner is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kushner-has-discussed-us-saudi-diplomacy-with-saudi-crown-prince-2024-10-04/">the subject of scrutiny</a> as to whether his Saudi partnerships have influenced his work in the US government.</p>
<p>The rumoured EA buyout would continue the past decade's consolidation of game developers and publishers in the hands of a select few megacorporations. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">completed their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year</a>, adding Call of Duty, Diablo and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> to the Xbox haggis. The world's largest videogame publisher, Tencent, have scooped up big outfits like Riot Games, Sumo Group and Funcom, while acquiring majority stakes or sizeable minority shares in the likes of Epic, Krafton and Paradox Interactive. Tencent recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funnelled a huge reservoir of money into Ubisoft</a> as part of the latter's wider corporate restructuring to focus on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six.
</p>
<p>EA have <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ea-sports-apex-legends-sales-electronic-arts-earnings-1236473474/">seen "better-than-expected" revenue growth</a> lately, but they've had some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">significant disappointments</a> in the past year or two, and are currently betting rather a lot on Battlefield 6, with executives allegedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">hell-bent on attracting 100 million players</a>. Whatever their current fortunes, it seems plausible that layoffs will follow any buyout, as the new overlords seek to 'optimise' their investment.
</p>
<p>I'll wire EA a request for comment.</p>
