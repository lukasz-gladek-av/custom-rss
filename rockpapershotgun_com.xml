            <p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a> - the memey baggy slinging simulator that's actually a deceptively moreish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/co-op">co-op</a> factory game - is now in open beta. It's named v0.3.4, which sounds like it has deep number mythology behind it, but developer Tyler is calling this the game's 'first proper update'. As with his plans for all updates, it's going to be floating around in a beta for a few days first. You can find the full update notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">here</a>, alongside instructions to access the branch.</p>

<p>So, what's in the update? Let's crack it open like a lump of bad quality soapbar and see what's written on the little bit of plastic inside. That is a reference for like, five people, all of whom should know better by now.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Added Bleuballs Boutique interior and functionality.</li>
<li>Added Pawn Shop interior and functionality. You can now sell pretty much anything (excluding product) to Mick at the pawn shop.</li>
<li>Added wooden sign.</li>
<li>Added metal sign.</li>
<li>Added wall-mounted shelf.</li>
<li>Added safe.</li>
<li>Added antique wall lamp.</li>
<li>Added modern wall lamp.</li>
<li>Added grandfather clock.</li>
<li>Added Ol' Man Jimmy's.</li>
<li>Added Château La Peepee.</li>
<li>Added Brut du Gloop.</li>
<li>Added silver watch.</li>
<li>Added gold watch.</li>
<li>Added silver chain.</li>
<li>Added gold chain.</li>
<li>Added gold bar.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>These additions are joined by some bugfixes. The delivery destination dropdown menus won't overflow outside of your phone screen anymore, and there are a few co-op tweaks. This isn't everything, mind. "This beta doesn't quite contain 100% of the features coming in the full release," says Tyler. "I'll be adding a few more decorative objects tomorrow. I wanted to get this beta out ASAP so that the new wall-mounted objects and pawn shop interface can be thoroughly trialled."</p>
<p>I think that's the first time I've seen 'trialled' written out? It scans, sure, but it also unnerves me in ways I'm not quite ready to come to terms with. Nevermind that.

            <p>A little pigeon, huh? <a href="https://x.com/rosaslutzemburg/status/1655706412977209344">And she's your pal!</a> Well, isn't that great. <a href="https://x.com/tenstackstudios">Tenstack</a> are a tiny Swedish studio on a mission to make "digestible games so people won't choke playing them". They're currently making a new small game every 3 months, the latest of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-wings-deliveries">Little Wings Deliveries</a>. It's under a fiver, under an hour, and is maybe the third or fourth game at this point to have a skateboarding pigeon in. I do not mind. I have a headache. The soothing coos and soothing faceplants of a skateboarding pigeon are just what I need right now.</p>

<p>You play as Skye, a purple pigeon that's decided to stand out from her scavenging brethren by getting a bloody job, bless her. On her way to the Royal Postal Academy, you'll visit floating islands, grind, fly, meet weirdo inhabitants, and collect various objects of note. "Embark on a short, playful adventure in your cozy flying boat and sail through fluffy clouds," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457390/Little_Wings_Deliveries/">Steam</a>. "Discover floating islands and befriend their quirky citizens. Jump, roll, climb, and skate through Cloudburg."</p>
<p>Featuring:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Around 30 minutes to 1 hour of playtime!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sail through the clouds with your flying boat!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explore 5 different tiny flying islands!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meet a small cast of quirky characters!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Collect cool items like a skateboard, selfie stick, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I could berate this pigeon for building a wooden sky raft instead of using her perfectly good wings, but this is the kind of avian innovation we should be praising. The more calories the pigeons save, the less disastrous chippy assaults. Nicely done, Skye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2020, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> developer Robin Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-half-life-alyx-interview">told Katharine</a> (RPS in peace) that one of the hardest things in first-person shooter development is persuading people to look up. "One of the problems you always run into in an FPS is that players are really good at looking horizontally with their mouse, but they don't look up and down nearly as much," said Walker. "You've really got to work to make a player look up in FPS games."</p>
<p>You will definitely need to look up in Orbifold, a forthcoming shooter project from Hi-Rez programmer Chris Cullen. In this Unreal Engine 5 creation, firefights take place inside a giant, verdant ball akin to a miniature Dyson Sphere, but with no captive star. Players are gravitationally rooted to the exterior of the ball, meaning you can run all the way around the inside. There are also Halo-style launchers that punt you directly through the middle. Here's a slice of very WIP footage featuring some airborne android nuisances.</p><!--more-->

Cullen has been working on Orbifold in his spare time for a few years. The game doesn't have a store page or presskit just yet, though Cullen did show it off at <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/indie-game-showcase-2024">an event in Auckland, New Zealand last year</a>. I've scraped together a few more details from the project's <a href="https://x.com/OrbifoldGame/">Xitter feed</a>, with the stern caveat that all of this is, again, in a state of evolution, and that certain features might be abandoned.
</p><p>Cullen mentions rivers that flow around the inside of the sphere, tunnels and elevators beneath the surface, an upgrades system, various enemy android classes, co-op multiplayer, and a level editor that could be released alongside the game. Among the recent reveals is a Saturn Blast ability that lets you palm strike yourself skyward - this reminds me of Pharah's Concussive Blast in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Catch a video of it below.</p>

<p>Most tempting of all, for my money, are Cullen's ideas for grenades. He envisages slapstick varieties that launch attackers right across the sphere. You can imagine a co-op scenario where players punt groups of foes back and forth as though playing robot tennis.</p>
<p>You can imagine all kinds of things. Come, let us bask in the glow of hypotheticals. I'd love to see a Halo Warthog driver attempt to make sense of these conditions. I'd love to see players, enemies and pieces of debris getting stuck in a Lagrangian point at the sphere's centre. Ah, Lawbreakers, you died too young. A little less explosively, the playspace also recalls the ringworld from the amazing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> DLC expansion Echoes Of The Eye.</p>
<p> Hopefully Cullen will treat us to a proper announcement in the not-too-distant future. I'm not sure what exactly he does at Hi-Rez Studios, but it's obviously worth noting that, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a> aside, Hi-Rez are the creators of the momentous, gravity-snubbing FPS Tribes: Ascend. They sold the rights to that series to a spin-off subsidiary, Prophecy Games, in 2019. Prophecy released Tribes 3: Rivals in 2023, but it didn't set the internet alight and the developers have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-already-in-trouble-as-developers-shift-focus-elsewhere">shifted their attention elsewhere</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
