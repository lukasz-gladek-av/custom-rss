            <p>As part of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, Microsoft cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a> developers ZeniMax Online Studios. Now, the union that represents a number of devs left in limbo by that game's canning have issued an update about the process of fighting for their futures.</p>
<p>ZOS' MMO, codenamed Project Blackbird, wasn't the only game Microsoft pulled the plug on as they let go of around 9k people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot were also wiped out, with the latter studio being shuttered to boot.</p>

<p>"Earlier this month, Microsoft indefinitely shelved an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on the project," wrote ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU), not to be confused with similarly named union ZeniMax Workers United. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">The former</a> represents web developers, designers, engineers, and graphic artists who were working on ESO and this unannounced MMO, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">the latter</a> is focused on QA staff.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game," they continued, "However, despite discussions regarding the status of our employment, the fact is: we have not yet been laid off."</p>

</span></p><p>The current state of play the union outline is that their "worker-volunteers" are busy bargaining with Microsoft on behalf of those affected members.</p>
<p>"Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support," they wrote. "It is true that a layoff may be in the future for some of our members. However, as a result of our organising, we are able to ensure that those impacted will be able to depart with dignity."</p>
<p>While being able to "depart with dignity" potentially being the best outcome some of these devs can hope for doesn't sound all that comforting, one can only imagine how much worse a situation these devs might be in without something in place to help fight their case.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if any of these devs do end up out of a job, they are able to at least go with favourable exit terms and compensation. It's the least they'd deserve following, in the union's words, a situation that's meant "lives were upended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">without prior notice or communication</a> from Microsoft leadership".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first thing that happened to me <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218790/The_Little_Tomb_The_Maholova_Club_and_the_Search_for_a_Dead_Body/">in the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-little-tomb-the-maholova-club-and-the-search-for-a-dead-body">The Little Tomb: The Maholova Club And The Search For A Dead Body</a> was a stuffed horse on a spring telling me it knew when and how I'd die. Many such horses. You play as Kofun, a boy shaped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun">keyhole tomb</a> who is also sort of an actual keyhole tomb but also a boy who wants to fulfill his destiny <em>as</em> a keyhole tomb, namely by finding a dead body to bury inside of himself. He lives in a park with his mate Haniwa, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haniwa">Haniwa</a>. Haniwa's secret is that he's very good at calligraphy. Here's some visual orientation in case you're not caught up yet.</p>

<p>It's from Cavyhouse, whose previous offering was “dungeon agriculturalization roguelite game” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396980/The_Sealed_Ampoule">The Sealed Ampoule</a>. The demo itself is a little too short to get a good feel for things, but if it's at all representative, the game is primarily about hanging out with good weirdos and poking objects.</p>
<p>You hang about in the park Kofun and Hanawa live in. You slide down a slide. Swing on a swing. Swing on a bar, an annoying object for its refusal to bend to the verb-noun symmetry found elsewhere. You collect points for doing all this, then spend them on pondering various objects. I very much enjoy the idea of a <em>pondering currency</em>, both conceptually and in practise. It's all suitably whimsical but then Kofun will occasionally gesture at the fact that he is, undoubtedly, a tomb. I am nothing if not curious to see where this all goes. <a href="https://www.artribune.com/progettazione/2025/07/anticipazioni-videogiochi/">Cheers to The Attribune</a> for the spot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finally-a-game-about-a-boy-who-thinks-hes-a-tomb-searching-for-a-dead-body-to-bury-inside-of-him]]></content:encoded>
