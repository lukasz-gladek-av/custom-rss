            <p>Yesterday was Fallout Day, the date in the series' universe when the bombs dropped and permanently turned a lot of people into those skeletons you grind into dust while tramping about in your power armour. Bethesda awakened Todd Howard from cryo-sleep, and announced some stuff in a broadcast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> are being sold to people again. Also, in admittedly more exciting news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Burning Springs update got a proper release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming second series of Prime Video's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-radiates-new-vegas-with-a-trailer-heavy-on-stupid-sexy-house-and-a-december-debut-date">Fallout TV Show</a> was also there, with that and the 76 update set to make December <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enlisting-walton-goggins-for-a-fallout-76-expansion-in-total-tonal-tandem-with-season-2-came-organically-devs-say-despite-previous-hint-at-very-limited-crossover">very Walton Gogginsy</a>.</p>

<p>First, we might as well get the <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> over with. It's mainly a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-esque title engrandening around the RPG hitting Nintendo Switch 2 via a re-release that's also dropping for PC on November 10th. It's basically the all-DLC game of the year edition, but with 150 bits of extra creation club stuff and a new menu dedicated to its more modern form, creations.</p><p>How you feel about both likely depends on whether you're cool with the idea of leaning into mods which have been given the official Bethesda thumbs up to add an extra twist to your thousandth trip through the Commonwealth. Odds are that's much more appealing to console players whose mod access is limited, with the bigger question for us PC folks being whether the anniversary edition's arrival will come with an update to the original game which leaves existing mods in need of a nudge to get working again.</p>
<p>On the even more cynical side, the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas' ultimate edition is <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6CJ0fC8EQZTdOXQD90VAnz/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced">being re-released</a> with a bundle of merch to commemorate its 15th Anniversary. This arrives next year, and will set you back an eye-watering <a href="https://international.gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">£139.99</a> / <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">$154.99</a>. That's for the New Vegas ultimate edition that you can currently get for £4 / $5 / €5 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/13435/">Steam</a> as of writing, thanks to a deal that ends shortly. Or £16 / equivalent if it's reset to regular price and you don't fancy waiting for the next sale.</p>
<p>Why the price hike? Well, there's a PVC statue of Victor, some of Doc Mitchell’s two-headed bear pictures, and a few pins/patches of the clothing variety lobbed into a bigger box. Now, as someone who once bought a cheap fan-made t-shirt with the graffiti logo of Ulysses from the Lonesome Road DLC on it, I may be chucking stones in a glass house here, but er, no, my wallet will be staying closed.</p>
<p>I will, however, likely give Fallout 76's TV Show Ghoul-centric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Burning Springs update</a> a go when it arrives on the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s3LXe6vs14YRUdiQpBhSf/fallout-76-burning-springs-preview">freshly revealed</a> full release date of December 2nd. I'm sceptical it'll be able to avoid feeling like a rather naked cash-in on the Fallout TV Show that struggles to justify its existence much beyond that, but I'll give it a chance to prove me wrong before declaring either way.</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier Todd Howard also popped up during the Fallout Day stream. We know you want things, and are working on things, he told the assembled throngs. Cheers Todd, replied the assembled throngs.</p>

            <p>Speaking as a veteran insomniac who routinely has to operate across time zones, let me share a few of my top tips for staying awake when you really want to sleep. Firstly, fill your eyes with as much light as possible - moonlight, fridgelight, phonelight, flamingoilbarrelight - and your lungs with as much bracing outdoors air as they can take. Secondly, enlist a similarly restless friend for some mutual tickling. Thirdly, remember your failures. All of them. Fourthly, consume a carefully calibrated mixture of fresh fruit and coffee, then look up dad jokes on Reddit.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like any of these proven strategies will work in Sleep Awake, the new first-person "psychedelic" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director and designer Cory Davis and his team at Eyes Out. Nobody wants to tickle you here, going by the trailer. Nobody has any dad jokes to share. They just want to beat you to a bloody sludge with pipes.</p><!--more-->
<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a city called the Crush, the last known city on Earth. Humanity faces extinction thanks to a mysterious force that disappears people when they fall asleep. Such civilisation as remains consists largely of addled cultists, would-be messiahs and assorted lairy randos, all battling desperately to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>The game's levels are strewn with various means of prolonging wakefulness, from that old classic the bed of nails, to dubious brain-modifying technology that resembles the Pilot's throne in Alien. You will creep around, corner to corner, solving puzzles and straying into a parallel dimensions that may or may not be hallucinations. There's music from Robin Finck of Nine Inch Nails. They're pretty loud, aren't they? Good choice of rock pedigree for this setup. Imagine if they'd hired Simon &amp; Garfunkel. There'd be no humans left after 30 minutes.</p><p>Sleep Awake now has a release date - December 2nd - announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies Showcase</a> of indie malarkey. Perfect. A decent remove from the Xmas hols, but still close enough to cast a shadow over Santa's strained, unblinking face. You can find a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>. Or you can read Oisin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sleep-awake-a-visually-inviting-horror-game-from-the-dev-behind-spec-ops-the-line-has-a-demo-out-now">slightly mixed impressions</a> of that demo.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle against the bot farmers continues with a series of backend updates from EA. Amongst other things, the developers have reversed some "unintended" changes to XP progression and balance, and removed bots from "verified" modes available through the Portal editor.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Last week, the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-updates-to-speed-up-xp-progression-and-unlocks-as-ea-tackle-plague-of-bot-farmers">announced</a> that they were taking action against players who'd created matches simply to murder computer-controlled soldiers en masse for easy XP. The argument being that Battlefield 6's servers are filling up with XP factories, making it harder for players to find the weird and wonderful mode variations that Portal is supposed to be for. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, the counterargument is that there might be fewer bot-processing joints and more flights of Battle-whimsy in Portal if the game's progression system were less annoying. I didn't find it particularly annoying during my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">pre-release time with multiplayer</a>, but then again, I'm not very competitive-minded and was in no hurry to unlock any of those fancy scopes. Too busy lying on my back, enjoying the deep blue sky over Gibraltar (while bleeding out).
</p>
<p>
I neglected to note in the previous story that Battlefield Studios have a more straightforward monetary interest, of course, in stopping people short-circuiting the XP system. Battlefield 6 is a live service game with a forthcoming battle pass and options to pay for XP and tier skips. It's harder to sell those special editions and Double XP boosters if people can accelerate the grind on custom servers.
</p><p>
Here's an update on their attempts to remedy the situation from Battlefield's social accounts. "We have organized a series of changes to emphasize our commitment to highlighting the player community and making this a space where you can celebrate creativity, find unique experiences, play with friends, and build communities.
</p>
<p>
"As part of this effort, we've rolled out several backend updates to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal. This includes resolving unintended systems that affected XP progression and balance across experiences, and for now, removing bots from Verified Experiences to help improve the overall quality of matches."
</p>
<p>
Verified experiences are a more curated and grounded selection of Portal modes that mostly let you twiddle with the settings of Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. Unlike other custom modes, these modes award full XP, so you can see why EA would be keen to do away with botfarming in verified experiences.
</p>
<p>
EA have now introduced a change whereby you'll need to disable "bot backfill" if you want full XP gain in a verified mode. Any verified experiences that have bot backfill will need to be unpublished and republished with the change. 
</p>
<p>
"Servers, including persistent ones, may occasionally need to be restarted," the developers add. "These brief interruptions may continue until ongoing improvements are fully implemented."
</p>
<p>
The first season of Battlefield 6's live seasonal seasonings begins on 28th October. It introduces a new map, some extra guns, a new mode, and a paid battle pass for those who partake.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s true ending didn't feel totally slam dunk satisfying to me in its 1.0 release form, and developers Supergiant Games seem to have agreed with those sorts of assessments. Hence, in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s first proper post-launch patch they've just put out as a Steam preview, some "true ending enhancements" being rolled out like a boon from a sassy god.</p>
<p>Shameless plug alert, if you want to read my full thoughts on that 1.0 version, you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">this here review</a>. The short version is that it's good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, enough of that, let's dive into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505090299391902119?l=english">the notes</a> for this post-launch first patch preview. "The Patch 1 Preview represents a work-in-progress whose contents may evolve, and some text translations are still in progress," Supergiant wrote. "We do not have a release date for the full patch."</p>
<p>In terms of their true ending tweaks, the studio say they've added some extra events with key characters you'll run into both before and after completing Melinoë's task. Bits of the ending scenes before the credits roll have also been "revised", while one change I can't say I'm necessarily a fan of is that the number of times you'll need to clear the underworld run before getting the final ending has gone up. On one hand, it'll ensure you get more chances to see these new scenes, but on the other, I fear it might feel a bit like padding in a game that's already treading a thin line in that regard towards the end.</p><p>Alongside those ending tweaks, Supergiant have added in a cauldron incantation which lets you go back in time and replay previous story beats, which is handy since it means I won't have to start from scratch to take in the revamped finale. "A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before," reads another of the patch's headline changes, while the decor you can buy for the crossroads now costs less spirit kudos points. Phew, no more lofty rug prices.</p>
<p>In terms of the usual bug fixes and balance adjustments, only one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms has had an aspect tweaked, that being the Witch's Staff's ability to burn folks when imbued with Hestia's smoulder ring cast boon. The boon and blessing specific tweaks are more numerous and a few bosses have had their hitboxes and effects adjusted.</p>
<p>There's more in the full notes, and if you want to give this preview a go, Supergiant have included instructions on how to opt into its Steam beta after backing up your saves.</p>
