<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> began life as a DLC expansion, but then developers Team Cherry decided the concept was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-developers-announce-a-full-sequel-silksong">"too large and too unique</a>", and upgraded it into a full game. They spent six years working on the thing in almost total silence, while fulminating legions of the terminally online quietly drove themselves bonkers hunting for release date clues. We now have a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-youve-only-got-to-wait-a-little-bit-skonger">Silksong release date</a> - it's just two weeks away - so in theory, the nightmare is over. Except, oh dear - Team Cherry are planning post-launch content for Silksong, and they're already calling it "ambitious". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">breakout interview</a> with Press X To Jason Schreier, the person who considerately does all the investigative reporting in games journalism so that humbler souls like myself can spend our days taking the piss out of him. According to Schreier, "they're already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come." Then there are some snippets from Team Cherry's founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," Pellen said. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."
</p>
<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," interjected Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p><p>
Those monsters! I look forward to revisiting this post in 2030, assuming RPS hasn't been turned into sausages by then, while writing up the latest rumours about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>: Polyestertune or Satinmelody or whatever they end up calling the third one.
</p>
<p>
Still, perhaps this is better interpreted as show of kindness. Earlier in the interview, Gibson and Pellen fret that by actually releasing Silksong, they're spoiling things for players for whom the real Silksong is speculating endlessly about the release of Silksong.</p>
<p>"It's nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they've obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it," said Gibson, diplomatically. Added Pellen: "Feels like we're going to ruin their fun by releasing the game." I guess this DLC tease is a bid to keep the dream alive, then.

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta is officially a Thing That Happened, and now comes the terrible ordeal of Learning From The Experience. Here is what developers DICE, Criterion, Motive and Ripple Effect have learned from the experience: you are all playing the game far too much like Call Of Duty. Goodness me, it's like 2007 never ended.</p>
<p>Doing headshots in midair? That's an updatin'. Doing a parkour while carrying a light machinegun? That's an updatin'. Bunny-hopping with prejudice? You'd best believe that's an updatin'. Never mind that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">those multiplayer reveal montages</a> emphasised footloose quickdraw almost as much as they incited a murderous contempt for helicopters. It's time to play Battlefield the way Battlefield should be played: lying in a hole praying that one of your team-mates spawns on you before a tank rolls over your head.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This, at least, is my addled Friday afternoon summary of EA's just-announced post-beta plans, via <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">Mecha-Hitler.com</a>. Let's squeeze into our thinking caps and break it all down.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the developers are doing a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons", to make them feel more unique, especially in terms of range. They're also making changes to encourage more controlled tap and burst-firing. In particular, the M87A1 shotgun has been defanged, and they're "investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences", with news of changes to follow.
</p><p>
As for movement, they want it to feel more "balanced and traditional" in the final version of Battlefield 6. There will be less carry-over of momentum and particularly horizontal speed from a slide to a jump. Jump height will also be lowered during consecutive jumps, and you'll be less accurate while jumping or sliding.</p>
<p>"These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable," the devs comment. You won't get as much acceleration when opening a parachute, either, "for more controlled aerial movement". I hate being in control of my aerial movement. In practice, it just makes it easier for people on the ground to shoot me.
</p>
<p>
The game's smaller maps are being tweaked to stop naughty people getting onto rooftops and venturing out of bounds. "This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas," the devs sternly explain. Bad ladder! Down!</p>
<p>They'll be testing two more maps in Battlefield Labs before release, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>'s Operation Firestorm and another map set in Mirak Valley, both of which offer "the full complement of vehicles" and "a more vast combat space". Vaster, EA, vaster! How am I supposed to trust you to fine-tune parachute physics when you can't even optimise your sentences. Yes, I realise I have just held up a red cape to all the amateur copyeditors in the comments.
</p><p>
Modes? Well, they've found that Rush gets a bit smeary when there are too many players involved. Apparently, "when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible", presumably because the attacking player's head and torso also become less tangible. As such, they're lowering the player count for Rush "to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode". 
</p>
<p>
Anticipating pushback on this front, the post points out that people can mess with the count as they please when playing Rush via the Portal editor. Breakthrough, meanwhile, will receive "map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders".
</p>
<p>
In general, EA are taking an ad hoc approach to player counts based on the individual map and mode. "For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64," the post comments. "It's the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps." They've found that "8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and [King of the Hill]". Again, you can jimmy the workings in Portal if you wish.
</p>
<p>
Some final bits: open and closed weapon playlists will continue to be available in Battlefield 6, "and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible". I'm not sure why that would be difficult? They're also trying to fix matchmaking so that you won't have too much difficulty finding games in which to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush.
</p><p>
Expect some of these improvements to materialise in forthcoming Battlefield Labs playtests. The game launches on 10th October. Our hardware editor James attended a preview event recently and came away with the verdict that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">"looks like a Battlefield game"</a>, thereby demonstrating the granular insight that got him promoted to CPU Wrangler First Class.</p>
<p>Even more granularistically, James noted that "there are also reasons to be optimistic that this is a series getting itself back on track, from its renewed emphasis on breaking shit to the replacement of show-off specialists with that old unspoken rule of 'Stick with your squad or perish.'" Did you play the beta? How did you find it?

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia celebrated its 1.0 release yesterday with a remarkably honest behind-the-scenes video from developers Evil Empire, detailing the ups and downs of a year-long Early Access period, including the decision to completely overhaul the game's art style and redesign its purple-skinned protagonist.</p>
<p>The video opens with the admission that this Roguelike take on the wall-jumping, time-rewinding Prince suffered multiple blows upon its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">Early Access release</a> in May 2024. The first of these was the surprise drop of heavyweight <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, which also launched in May and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-devs-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-dodges-hades-2-with-a-release-date-delay">stole most of the Prince's limelight</a>. The second was the negative player response to both the game's lack of content and its colourful visual style, which was inspired by Persian miniature paintings and the artwork of Mœbius/Jean Giraud.</p>

<p>Notably, the decision to give the titular Prince and all NPCs a purple skintone was met with confusion. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKOM1f9KCWQ">developer diary</a> from 2024, it was revealed that this was intended as a direct ode to the PC CGA port of Prince of Persia from 1990, which featured neon skin for all due to a limited 4-colour palette. Unfortunately, this homage went over the heads of most players.</p><p>"During a brainstorming session about skins, our art director had raised a seemingly innocent question," says Evil Empire Marketing Manager Matthew Houghton in the video. "Are we sure that making the Prince purple won't be a problem? At the time, everyone told him no. He was overthinking it; colours are cool, they're stylish, it adds a bit of fantasy! Well...now we all know how that turned out."</p>

</figure>
<p>The rest of the footage details how Evil Empire not only packed The Rogue Prince of Persia with additional content, but also revamped the art style - a decision that is now conveyed in more detailed levels and a decidedly less-purple Prince adorning everything from the game's key art to the album cover of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nE-Q-EmpvPc2YArqWRhFOd60vkNP8WYR4">impressive soundtrack</a> by Persian American musician ASADI. Alas, even this visual update faced unexpected friction in the form of a bizarre Steam issue which required the devs to use a Spanish phone number to get their own product updated.</p>
<p>"Through all those problems and roadblocks," Houghton continues, "we've had a great community giving us a helping hand the whole way. Even when it was clear we had a tonne of work to do, they've been there giving us support, feedback and encouragement. So a special shoutout to you guys for sticking with us on our crazy journey."</p><p>Despite these nice words, Houghton acknowledges that the game has faced a low player count during its Early Access. The 1.0 release is now considered final, and throughout the video there does seem to be a slight feeling of "well, we sure hope more folks play this, or else we'll never make a sequel." Which would be a shame, considering that last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a superb effort that Ubisoft sent out to die with poor promotion before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">disbanding</a> the team behind it.</p>
<p>I intend on giving the Rogue Prince of Persia a proper go this weekend and am looking forward to it. I also liked the purple Prince look, because I can't help but admire unorthodox art design decisions, especially when they're an ultra-niche homage to computer colour schemes that existed when I was a kid. But I can see how his grape skin along with the game's more cartoony and dreamy original visuals failed to latch onto players, and it does feel as if the final result is actually a tad more reminiscent of the Persian miniature inspiration.</p>
<p>Most of all, however, I'm sticken by the frankness of Evil Empire in this video. Despite taking over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> DLC from Motion Twin, Houghton consistently acknowledges that the team was inexperienced in certain regards, and that this was their first fully-fledged project. It's rare to see admissions of setbacks that aren't couched in corporate industry speak (particularly for a gaming brand owned by Ubisoft). I only hope that the Rogue Prince of Persia manages to catch a few more eyes because of it.</p>
