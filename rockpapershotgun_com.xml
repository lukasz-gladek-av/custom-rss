Crafting a world that begs to be explored is a tricky thing to do, especially when the world is kind of sucky, doubly so when it's woven mostly through words with only supplementary imagery to provide a broader context. Yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper's</a> is one I'm often thinking about because amongst all the grand sci-fi concepts is a grounded sense of reality that you'll always find in the best of the cyberpunk genre. And here I am, a year on from the second game's release, tempted to return once more, but this time in a form based on its tabletop origins.
</p>
<p>
Citizen Sleeper: Spindlejack is not technically a new game, it actually came out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-now-has-a-free-solo-tabletop-rpg">last May</a> as a free-to-download mini-RPG, but now through Lost in Cult it is being turned into a tangible, physical thing you can add to your dragon's hoard of tabletop RPGs. Spindlejack takes place in a particular corner of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2's</a> world, on the Far Spindle, a place where the airbike riders are "notorious." It's a solo TTRPG, where you fly around said airbike making tricky deliveries for "cryo, reputation and fun."

Where this release mainly differs is obviously the physicality, coming with a set of 10 themed D6 dice, some fancy bits of informative paper, and stickers, but it also comes with a couple of additional modules. One is Sprocket's Shop, which comes with new upgrades and items for some added tactics and techniques. The other is a story-based one, Kadet's Climb, where you play as Kadet from the original video game, who is "trying to survive on the far Spindle as she rises up through the ranks of the station's most infamous delivery couriers."
</p><p>
I am certainly quite tempted by such a luxurious item, but again, none of us have to feel FOMO as it's available to play for free through <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">itch.io</a>. If it is something you're interested in however, <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/citizensleeper2">here's a handy link for you</a>.

            <p>
There are not enough games in the world where it feels like the initial concept was born from the thought, "wouldn't it be funny if…" I'm no fool, I know this is because developing a video game is akin to getting hit by a car, miraculously coming away from it unscathed, only to be hit by six more cars as you continue your journey. In any case, this is still how I would like to imagine Trust Me, I Nailed It was born, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game where you have to make cool video edits of some warrior to make him seem like a monster slaying legend.
</p>
<p>
This is, through and through, a ridiculous concept, one that aesthetically maybe doesn't mesh entirely well, but I am still clowning with all the same. This is one of those fake OS kind of games a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, with the main bit of faux software you use being World Movie Weaver (i.e., Windows Movie Maker).

On your timeline, rather than finding the usual video section and audio section, there is an enemy attack pattern section, pre-filled, showing you exactly where an enemy will strike on the grid-based battlefield, and the warrior's attack pattern section, which you are dictating in the edit. You can drag different clips to make the warrior move, perform different types of or block attacks, there's "post-processing" modifiers that let him teleport, or even just take no damage at all. It's movie magic, baby.
</p><p>
Little bits of story are then relayed through emails and posts on MSN (Mana Scroll Network (nice once)), where you can see whether people believe this actually quite cowardly hero is as cool as you've edited him to be or not.
</p>
<p>
The lack of aesthetic meshing I mention is because the hero scenes are all sort of generic fantasy, and the fake OS honestly just looks straight up like Windows 98. I wish there was a stronger sense of identity, what would an operating system look like in a fantasy world? How would technology impact the world, and magic, in kind? This is just a small gripe, though, the concept is fun enough that I won't lose sleep over it. Plus it'll be free! Can't complain about free.
</p>
<p>
It's also due out really soon, as it's currently slated for release next week on February 6th, so in the meantime, you can wishlist it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4311000/Trust_Me_I_Nailed_It/">here</a>.
