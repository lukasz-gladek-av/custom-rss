            <p>Sometimes, when you're fighting aliens, you've got to whip out a gun that might explode in your own face. Them's the rules. You've got to risk it for a chocolate biscuit. Or, at least that's premise of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s latest warbond.</p>
<p>Dubbed Control Group, it'll give you access to a bunch of experimental gear Super Earth's scientists have cobbled together from captured Illuminate tech if you opt to pick it up when it drops on June 17th.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-launches-july-17/">the PS Blog</a> penned by Arrowhead community manager Katherine Baskin, this warbond for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> includes a primary weapon, three stratagems, and the usual array of stocking fillers.</p>
<p>I'll start off with the stratagem that's caught my eye, the LIFT-182 warp pack. With help from the Illuminate's spooky dark fluid (ooh, matron), it generates a "(somewhat) stable wormhole on demand", which you can then hop into to teleport short distances without a cooldown. As with all of the main Control Group warbond gear, however, there's a quirky catch. Each time you teleport, the hole destabilises a bit more. If you attempt one jump too many, it'll warp you into the afterlife. Nice.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention, Helldivers! The Ministry of Defense Research &amp; Development team has just declassified the following information for immediate release.</p><p>You have been cleared to field test a new range of experimental weapons built from acquired alien technology.

<p>Continuing that trend, the primary's a VG-70 Variable volley gun that comes with three firing settings, with one spunking out all of your remaining ammo at once in a fashion that's possibly fatal to the user. The PLAS-45 Epoch plasma gun stratagem might explode in your face if you overcharge it. The third stratagem, an A/LAS-98 laser sentry turret, will go boom if you forget to let it cool down every so often.</p>
<p>Armour-wise, there's the AD-49 Apollonian heavy set and the AD-26 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a> medium set, with both boasting an "Adreno-Defibrillator" that'll revive you once, but leave you slowly dying once it's done so. So, best get the mission done quick once you're on your second life.</p>
<p>All it all, it looks to be one of the more fun warbonds Arrowhead's put together so far, especially for those of us who're not mega into alternative ways to look like you've got some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">dodgy views</a> about authoritarianism or cosplay as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">Judge Dredd</a>. Given HD2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-review">at its best when you're having a laugh</a>, I'm glad it's getting being stabbed with a slapstick syringe on the 17th.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a> has attracted a fair few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> comparisons for its sci-fi squad combat and romanceable companions since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">announcement last month</a>. Not least from developers Owlcat themselves, who've namechecked the "iconic" RPGs as inspirations. In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons">recent interview with Polygon</a>, creative director Alexander Mishulin said he's humbled, but that Osiris Reborn also has its own approach to choice, consequence, and storytelling  that's a bit different from Bioware's sci-fi trilogy and also the other one (Andromeda was actually pretty solid though).</p>

<p>"Some [people] get into the industry of making games because they saw [Mass Effect] and were inspired. So it would be impossible to deny that Mass Effect had a lot of impact on us as game developers," Mishulin told Polygon. “On the other hand, it’s an Owlcat Games game and it’s different in many ways. We make our story a little bit differently. We’re making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency.”</p>
<p>Which I choose to interpret as him very diplomatically calling Mass Effect's morality system a bit naff, at least in comparison to the CRPG lineage Owlcat are used to working with in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warty Thou: Rogue Trader</a>. Which, fair, but also choices like "do the horrible Genophage and annoy your best Krogan mates or don't do that" felt monumental at the time. </p>
<p>"If you happen to be playing a character of Mars origin or Earth origin — and you will be able to select your origin from the start — you will not be very welcomed on Ceres because of those events," Mishulin offers as an example of how your character's background will set the stage for future encounters. But if you're playing as a Belter in the same situation, there'll more "opportunities, more places to visit, probably some new side quests and everything".</p>
<p>Owlcat aren't "modernising" Mass Effect, Mishulin goes on to say, "just making a game in the same genre but with all the modern trappings."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/owlcat-welcome-mass-effect-comparisons-with-their-expanse-rpg-but-say-theyre-approaching-choice-and-consequence-differently]]></content:encoded>
