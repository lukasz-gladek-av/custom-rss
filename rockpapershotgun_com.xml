If you like your board games a little less physical, and a little more not technically a board game any more if we're being honest but that's fine because it's a neat looking, strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now, then boooooy howdy do I have the game for you! Those familiar with the dungeon crawling tabletop game Descent will be interested to learn that it's getting a video game adaptation in the form of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent.
</p>
<p>
Before we press on, I'd just like to say that it's specifically Terrinoth with the all rights reserved symbol, <em>then</em> it says Heroes of Descent. That's silly! Don't do that! It makes your game name look weird. Anyway, this just so happens to be the first game adaptation of the modern classic board game, and it's sounding like a pretty tight experience overall.

For starters, there's eight different adventurers to choose from, which judging from the trailer includes some guys that can do magic, some gals that can slice 'n' dice or shoot a bow and arrow, a thiefy lookin' fellow, the usual kind of fantasy RPG type characters. Dungeon crawling is still the name of the game too, with apparently 20 dungeons to play through, all with different storylines, and characters that'll adapt to whichever adventurers make up your party.
</p><p>
I quite like that on the Steam page it highlights that the different missions you can complete in the main campaign can be beaten in one night, makes it feel like it's going for a "getting the gang together for DnD" kind of vibe. Which you can do! Because there's co-op for up to four people at once.
</p>
<p>
The combat is described as accessible, though that is more meant in terms of it being not annoyingly complex as opposed to having accessibility features. It's turn-based, with a big emphasis on positioning, elevation, line of sight, and timing, all that jazz. For those more familiar with the board game's story, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is also a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, but that'll probably mean more to those in the know than it does to me.
</p>
<p>
And there's even a demo you can try out right now, which is quite nifty as there's no release date other than sometime this year, so it'll give you something to mess around with until then. You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929630/Terrinoth_Heroes_of_Descent/">here</a>.
