"I am going to screw on my happy cap and try to find some upbeat/quirky news, because I feel like we could do with a bit," I declared to the RPS Slack just now, after writing our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">eighth layoff/cancellation post</a> this week. The very next thing I click is a link for a game about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842300/Hell_Builder/">building hell</a>. Not today, Satan. "Amnesia flying meat orb! Amnesia flying meat orb!" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qpJsLRhvUk">suggests</a> James. James, you are not helping. Why are you never helping. Oh, what's this? An unbeatably broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-bosses">Elden Ring Nightreign bossfight</a>? Perhaps this is the champion who will lead us out of our endless technofeudal apocalypse. No seriously, I think Animus, Ascendant Light is really onto something, here.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The misfiring FromSoft bossfight in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Nightreign's enhanced Everdark Sovereign edition</a> of the Sentient Pest, which is actually three bosses in one. The basic version of that fight pits you against two huge insects. The enhanced edition adds a massive red moth which swoops in when you kill one of the other two and possesses it, reviving the creature in a powered-up state.</p>
<p>You can damage the red moth by attacking the revived critters. The trouble is, Animus has been going AWOL. Despite a hotfix this week, players continue to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lrhc2e/we_killed_the_two_so_fast_that_animus_bugged_out/">report cases</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-is-struggling-to-squash-an-elden-ring-nightreign-bug-that-sees-its-new-third-boss-bug-vanish-from-a-notorious-duo-bug-fight-making-it-impossible-to-win/">Gamesradar</a>) of the battle extending indefinitely because the third boss refuses to show up. The trigger condition for this issue appears to be killing both the original bugs at the same time, but the situation remains murky. A permanent solution is <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1941051928022339943">forthcoming</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy this partly because it suggests Animus is refusing to play favourites between the two other pests, and partly because it feels like Animus has been taking notes from <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">Da Share Zone</a> - and who could blame a From Software boss for wanting to Just Walk Out, Skeleton (co-op player battles if your quick). These magnificent creatures have been getting their faces kicked off for a decade, with Youtubers dedicating whole careers to their dissection, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> specifically is a live service mincing machine. You could fill a kaiju birdfeeder with all the Sentient Pests players have chopped and shredded so far.</p>
<p>So good on Animus, I say. Good on it for washing its proboscis of the whole stinking debacle. Good on it for divesting from the GaaS industry. I am going to follow in its footsteps by refusing to come to work tomorrow. That'll teach the status quo who's boss.

            <p>The new MMO from the Elder Scrolls Online developers would reportedly have been a sci-fi noir affair in which players swing around tall buildings on grappling lines, and do aerial dashes while shooting and looting. Call it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> Spider-Man. Call it Destiny 2077. Call it whatever you like, frankly, because it has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">abandoned</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">wider layoffs at parent company Microsoft</a>, the outfit that made tens of billions of dollars in profit this past financial quarter, yet has decided to jettison thousands of staff in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">"discipline" and "continued success"</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">Bloomberg</a>, where Jason Schreier offers a brief account of the Blackbird project's final hours. Previously codenamed Kestrel, it had apparently been in development since 2018, and was a third-person shooter with looting elements and a heavy emphasis on vertical movement - grapples, double-jumps, aerial dashes, and wall-climbing. According to Bloomberg, ZeniMax Online Studios envisaged the game as the beginning of a "new franchise", running alongside Elder Scrolls Online, which has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-f2p">a wobbly endeavour at times</a> but is currently quite the success story, earning a reported $2 billion in total revenue by 2024.</p>
<p>By March this year, the development team had reportedly expanded to 300 people, and Xbox executives Phil Spencer and Matt Booty are said to have been impressed by a demo they sampled in March 2025. But the positivity was not to last. According to Bloomberg's sources, staff were shocked to learn this week that ZeniMax Online Studios head Matt Firor had left the company, and that project Blackbird had been "indefinitely shelved".</p>
<p>Many of those employees now face redundancy, pending the outcome of a haggle over things like severance packages between Microsoft and their union. A Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed this much to Bloomberg, commenting "represented employees are awaiting information regarding these proposed impacts and next steps, which are subject to negotiations with the union".</p>
<p>The scale of Microsoft's recent earnings make this week's layoffs feel like an enormous practical joke. Still, I can guess at elements of the executive reasoning here. Live service games are both costly and increasingly risky, because there is so much competition. Schreier also claims that ZeniMax Online Studios were developing the game's engine technology alongside the game itself, which in my experience covering such things is a hard act to pull off.</p>
<p>Still, assuming Bloomberg's reporting is legit, the fact remains that the C-suits liked it and Microsoft seem to have doubloons to spare right now. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report]]></content:encoded>
