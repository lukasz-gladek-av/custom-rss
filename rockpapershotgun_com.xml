            <p>Valve say a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-warband">Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</a> mod which reportedly misrepresented the events of the South Korean Gwangju Uprising was pulled offline worldwide by its creator, with the folks behind Steam only having blocked its distribution in South Korea.</p>
<p>The mod, reported on by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> yesterday, was called "Gwangju Running Man" and was a total conversion that turned Mount and Blade's medieval warfare into an apparently warped depiction of 1980's student-led protests against the military coup of Chun Doo-hwan, which were violently supressed by the country's army. Around 200 people are estimated to have been killed during <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/05/nx-s1-5215788/south-korea-martial-law">the uprising</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>However, despite records to the contrary, as well as the South Korean government <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2172098/gwanju-apology-south-korea-sorry-rape-and-torture-committed">apologising in 2018 for military atrocities</a> during the protests, Automaton cites the Korean Yonhap News Agency as reporting that Gwangju Running Man "depicted protesters as armed and violent criminals, thus framing the military regimeâ€™s brutality as justified."</p>
<p>As you can imagine, deliberately rewriting a key moment in <a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/06/gwangju-uprising-korean-war-seventieth-anniversary">South Korea's history and fight against being ruled by US-backed dictatorships</a> in such a way made the mod very controversial.</p>
<p>It's since disappeared from Steam Workshop, with Valve having clarified that the mod's creator was responsible for it being pulled worldwide, while the company had only moved to block access to the mod in South Korea. Initial reports had appeared to suggest Valve may have been behind the worldwide takedown, at the request of South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee, but instead it seems the company have dealt with this in a manner that more closely mirrors their previously established modus operandi.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-content-restrictions-removed">modus operandi</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-abdication-of-responsibility-over-steam-is-the-worst-possible-solution">for better or worse</a>, is to "allow everything onto the Steam Store, except for things that we decide are illegal, or straight up trolling", with this mod looking like it fell into the first category in South Korea specifically. </p>
<p>Here's hoping the next time Mount &amp; Blade: Warband modding hits the news, it's for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modder-superior-mount-blade-warband-game-of-thrones">something cool</a>, rather than what looks to have been offensive and far-right leaning utter bollocks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-say-controversial-mount-blade-warband-mod-accused-of-historical-revisionism-was-taken-down-by-creator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don't regret the many years I've spent not playing MMOs, but I do regret not taking part in the Great Hobbit Run. It's an annual event hosted by Twitch streamer BurkeBlack in which hobbit players of Standing Stone and Daybreak's absolutely ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord Of The Rings Online</a> try to walk all the way to Mount Doom, without taking on any quests. Which is to say, while doing the bare minimum of levelling up. </p>
<p>This year is the first year the community have made it to Sauron's hellmouth, and what better way to celebrate than by throwing themselves immediately into the lava. Here's the full video - skip to the end (or click <a href="https://x.com/0BurkeBlack0/status/1942510906698613112">this Xitter link</a>) for some footage of ecstatic burning Hobbits. Shame they left the Ring in the Shire.</p><!--more-->

<p>The full journey took seven hours, rather than the estimated six months (plus Rivendell layover) it took Frodo and company in the book. Frodo was a wimp, clearly.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/after-3-years-of-attempts-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmos-great-hobbit-run-is-finally-successful-as-a-band-of-tutorial-level-hobbits-make-it-to-mount-doom-and-celebrate-by-jumping-into-lava/">PCGamer</a>'s Scott McCrae, the area around Mount Doom is a level 112 zone. One can only imagine the feats of evasion and/or brassnecked brute-forcing necessary to navigate that landscape without putting in the customary grinding. As McCrae comments, it's lovely to encounter this kind of community commitment to a bit, given the recent dismal fortunes of always-online games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>.</p>
<p>Are there any always-online pilgrimages you're a part of? Now is the time to pull up a chair and sing us a tale of virtual misadventure. The only such thing I've dabbled with is Back To Lordran, the annual feast of jolly cooperation among <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players, but I'm also reminded distantly of how Elite: Dangerous players have collaborated to map their game's enormous galaxy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skullduggerous space MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> has changed the way its glittering golden subscription token is sold in the hellish hypercapitalist void. The change affects Plex, a shiny type of trade good you can use to re-up your subscription to the game. From now on, the ethereal digigood will be sold on a magical "global" market across the entirety of space, as opposed to being sold locally from region to region. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not an absolutely game-changing economic shake-up, but it may mildly irritate any folks who speculate on Plex as if it were shares in (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">ew</a>) Microsoft. The change might also make interesting reading for anyone who likes to think about Eve as a petri dish for Earth's increasingly corposwamped global economy.</p>
<p>Like the laser turrets and afterburners of Eve's interstellar market, you can sell and buy Plex for big amounts of in-game money. And just like any product, it has sometimes been more expensive to buy on one side of the galaxy, but cheaper on the other side. If you theoretically gathered a few billion ISK (the standard space credit earned by whacking rats or selling dodgy antennae) you could buy a stack of this Plex stuff and pay for your next month's subscription in real life. Neat. But it might be cheaper to buy in safe territory and more expensive deep in the wilderness. </p>
<p>This change means you'll now simply buy Plex via a global pool of sellers, which will appear the same anywhere in  New Eden, according to developers CCP.

</p><p>"This friction-free system aims to boost liquidity, enable a fair market equilibrium, and support EVE's evolving economy," they say in <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/global-plex-market-and-friction-free-trade">a post explaining the new market</a> (they also offer the <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/patch-notes-version-23-01">full patch notes</a>).

<p>"As stewards of New Eden's economy, CCP acts as both custodian and regulator, a central bank of sorts," the post continues. "PLEX plays a foundational role in this system. But over time [...] its function has drifted. It's increasingly treated as a long-term investment or speculative asset, rather than a flexible, fluid currency meant to empower player choice. That dynamic distorts pricing, limits access, and creates artificial scarcity that benefits a few at the expense of many. 

</p><p>"Weâ€™re committed to fixing that, without resorting to harsh measures like inventory taxes, price hikes, or product removals. Instead, we're focused on system-level changes that move us closer to a healthy, fair market equilibrium."

</p><p>For those of us not fluent in brokerspeak, CCP may basically be seeking to flatten out the price of their valuable little pretend gold bar across the entirety of pretend space. Plex is special, according to the devs, since it is also sold for real money directly by CCP. This makes it "the only item in the game directly tied to real-world currencies". </p>
<p>But it also acts like gold does in real world trade markets - a safe place for dirtbags to store their wealth. So it makes sense that CCP would want such a good to remain roughly the same everywhere. Stable. Goldish. In the short term, it may make Plex cheaper, as players selling it now have to compete against every other seller in the galaxy - not just their local star regions. In the long-term, everything may simply level out. </p>
<p>None of this, as far as I can tell, is related to the developers' ongoing attempts to drive players towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a>, a spin-off game that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">full of blockchain bullshit</a> and harbouring a cryptocurrency called the "Eve Token". CCP are incresingly shy of mentioning these facts in their marketing and advertising, but you can read about it by scrolling down <a href="https://evefrontier.com/en/faq">their FAQ</a>. My advice: avoid.</p>
