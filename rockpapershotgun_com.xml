            <p>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I've yet to play any of them. I likely won't play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/">via Steam</a> soon.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is much akin to the previous games in the series. These are traditional roguelikes, in which you head into a randomised dungeon split across many floors and attempt to delve ever deeper using the resources you find along the way. It's also got some neat online features, such as the ability to rescue or be rescued by other players should you collapse on a particular floor, so that you can continue with that character.
</p>
<p>Serpentcoil switches up the setting, introduces somewhat rudimentary 3D graphics, and modernises the UI a little, but should otherwise be deeply familiar to anyone who has played previous games in the series.
</p>
<p>The last Shiren game was The Tower Of Fortune And The Dice Of Fate, which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a relatively recent game, given it launched on PC and Switch in 2020. Alas, no, it first launched on Nintendo DS in Japan in 2010, and in the west for the Vita in 2016. That makes Serpentcoil Island the first new game in the series for 14 years.
</p><p>Serpentcoil Island also launched on Switch back in January of this year, which means you can find out every detail about the game if you're so inclined. It was pretty well received, with Famitsu giving it 38 out of 40.
</p>
<p>Why won't I play it? Because I find my patience for traditional roguelikes has lessened, these days. I might have plunged into my last procedural dungeon. Whatever appetite I do have left, I'm saving for the far more ambitious and wild Caves Of Qud, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-teases-a-10-release-date-with-a-tricksy-riddle-about-beetle-moons">due a polished 1.0 release on December 5th</a>. I do continue to enjoy listening to others wax lyrical about these games though, so if you think I'm wrongheaded and I should give Shiren his due, please pen a passionate ode in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.
</p>
<p>There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft outlined their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/4478361902017151340">approach to stealth in a new blog post</a>, which also includes links out to brief illustrative videos.
</p>
<p>"For the first time in the Assassin's Creed series, hiding in the shadows will make you invisible to enemies. During nighttime, any pocket of shadows becomes a dynamic hiding spot in which you can progress without being seen. This applies to both interiors and exteriors," explains the post. "The ability to use shadows in this way invites you to carefully study your environment for hiding opportunities and routes... or create them yourself by destroying lanterns with a shuriken."
</p>
<p>Likewise, "Naoe and Yasuke are the first protagonists able to go prone in the series." While lying down, you can roll in any direction, crawl under certain buildings, and commit special ankle-based assassination attacks.
</p>
<p>The post mostly focuses on Naoe, one of Shadows' two protagonists, who will carry a smoke bomb, shinobi bells for tossing to distract guards, throwing knives called Kunai, and shuriken which can stun enemies. Yusuke seems to have a similar set of stealth capabilities, but with a different arsenal and some unique wrinkles that will apparently be outlined at a later time.
</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is the return of double assassinations, a one-time iconic feature of the series. "By equipping the Tanto as one of your main weapons and unlocking the dedicated skill, you can eliminate two enemies standing next to each other at once with your Hidden Blade - whether on the ground or from the air," says the post.</p>
<p>The various RPG mechanics of more recent games of the series still remain, however, so it's possible to try to have your attempt denied if you have neglected your "Assassin Hidden Blade upgrades". The assassination prompt will change colour to let you know the outcome in advance: white if it's an instant kill, yellow if you'll deal just some damage, and red if it won't work at all.
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally supposed to come out this year, but was delayed until February 14th, 2025 seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">at staff's urging</a> and in response to somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">lukewarm sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Outlaws continues to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-latest-patch-is-out-and-aims-to-make-stealth-and-combat-more-satisfying">receive patches to improve its own stealth systems post-release</a>.
</p>
<p>I love a good lie down in a video game, so these changes sound appealing to me. I still hate that enemies can out-level a knife, though. My reward for the risk of getting close to an enemy, particularly a strong one, should be the ability to take them out in a single blow - although I realise that other philosophies of stealth may be valid also.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
