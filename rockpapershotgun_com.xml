You'd think that with Summer Game Fest technically being all wrapped up by now we'd all be done with showcases, and yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> are with a Spotlight of their own. One little game that got a look-in was, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Specifically, the second title update was shown off, which as always is adding a whole bunch of things in, so let's jump in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's two big monsters joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game with this update, which arrives next Monday, June 30th. First up is Lagiacrus, a big, blue, electricity crocodile/ dragon lookin' fella, who was also the flagship monster from Monster Hunter 3. Sure to be a hit, I imagine. There's also Seregios from Monster Hunter 4, a quick-moving, partially flying monster that honestly kind of just looks like a Chocobo.

<p>
July 23rd will see the arrival of the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a limited time event where the main hub will be decorated all fancy, and you'll be able to get equipment, gestures, and the like.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a Monster Hunter themed Fender guitar was released to celebrate the series' anniversary, and now in an event that's taking place from August 27th to September 24th, you'll be able to get a gesture that lets you shred some sick licks on an in-game version of the same guitar. Video games!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a bunch more outfits that you'll be able to pick up, free DLC like dance gestures, paid DLC like a new cosmetic pack, layered weapons are being added in, you'll be able to swap your handles so you can travel with Erik instead of Alma, and Mina, a sword and shield support hunter, is being added into the game. Oh, and you'll be able to choose which support hunters you bring with you on missions too. Title update 3 should be coming late September, but no exact release date on that one just yet.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is discounted right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a> thanks to its summer sale. The action game is 20% off, making it £48 down from £60, which still isn't cheap, but hey, take what you can get, especially with a game that only came out this year. Just keep in mind that it seems like your mileage when it comes to performance might vary.

Remember back in April when I told you about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor's</a> next update, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-next-update-brings-in-an-upgrade-system-a-chilly-new-zone-and-best-of-all-functioning-bins">Cold Fusion</a>? No? What do you mean you can't remember every single news post I've ever written? Fine, whatever, point is, it turns out that said update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543358846952800257?l=english">turned into the full on 1.0 release of the game</a>. And now, as shown off in a swanky new trailer for developer Deep Field, the release date for the release of 1.0 has been revealed!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Drum roll please… it's July 22nd! Which is less than a month away, so you've not got long to wait. That also happens to be when the co-op game is launching on console, but who gives a hoot about that round these parts? In any case, how about a little reminder about what's new in the full release. First up, there's a new area, the Residence Sector, which is where the final chapter of the base game is set. There's a new R.A.I.N shower (no idea what that acronym stands for) that gives you a nice clean.

Plus you can get "something that almost imitates Mexican cuisine" at The Taco Mine, which generally sounds quite inadvisable. And you can even build your own office cubicle, because who doesn't love replicating their workplace in a video game?
</p>
<p>
Deep Field have previously said that a 1.1 update will be coming at some point in 2025 as well, alongside more updates beyond that, but as of yet they haven't set an exact date, or even what that might entail. I expect they're a bit busy prepping that 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and if you want to pick it up at a bit of a discount ahead of its proper launch, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/">currently 20% off on Steam</a>. Go wild!

Do you… do you hear that? Can you feel it? That disgusting, gnawing feeling, a shiver down your spine because you know it's coming for you… the Steam summer sale… Friends, Romans, country(insert pronoun here), it is unfortunately that time of year again, that time where you look at all of those games in your wishlist as you try to figure out which deal is the best, and which to leave for the next inevitable sale.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Personally, there are far too many games in my wishlist that I'd like to buy now but I am also supposedly an Adult with Responsibilities, so I will try to refrain from picking anything up. Besides, that backlog isn't getting any shorter and my lifespan isn't getting any longer. Still! The mortifying concept of ego and literal death aside, I'm still going to make mention of a few notable games that have some healthy discounts, if only to make you think "oh yeah I've been meaning to play that."

<p>
For starters, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Death Stranding is 60% off</a> making it only £14, and considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s inevitable PC release is nowhere in sight, you might as well relieve some of that FOMO. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/">Elden Ring is quite a healthy 40% off</a> at £30, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/">so is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, making it £39</a>. Possible future GOTY and frequent discourse starter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a smaller discount of 10% off</a>, but that still makes it £38. Last year's actual GOTY <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/">UFO 50 is also only £16.80</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really want something cheap as chips, the groovy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer is as low as £1.27</a>. Heavily lesbian visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/">Heaven Will Be Mine is only £2.27 as well</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/">Robocop: Rogue City is £4.49</a>.
</p>
<p>
Point is, there's too many damn games that are really cheap right now. I'm sure you'll figure out your budget somehow.
