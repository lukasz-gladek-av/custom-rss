            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/if-letters-had-pants">If Letters Had Pants</a> appears to be the product of three different elevator pitches that took place in the same elevator, and somehow resolved amicably rather than eating each other alive.</p>
<p>The first pitch was for a verbal puzzler in which you combine letters into words on a randomised grid against the clock, with the twist that words vanish when scored to create blank spaces that can be bridged by other letter combinations for higher scores. The second pitch was for a bizarrely prudish roguelite that is all about ensuring that letters are properly dressed. And the third pitch was for an archaeological excavation sim in which you exhibit things like lost floppy discs, or sell them to expand your museum. The result, against the odds, is a single and cohesive video game rather than a claustrophobic clownfight. Witness the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Here’s how the moving parts join together. The word puzzle grid is also a patch of dirt, beneath which lurk the aforesaid archaeological relics. When you combine and remove letters, you’re also lifting away the soil to expose these priceless finds. </p>
<p>Putting pants on letters, meanwhile, gives them modifiers, for use in both the archaelogical excavation and grid puzzler sides of the game. For example, you can whack some gardening trousers on the letter “W” to plant a turnip when it's removed, which grows as you combine words and can eventually be harvested for bonus score. Similarly, you’ll unlock new modifiers as you expand your museum collection.</p>
<p>Ah, wait a minute. This is sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> again, isn’t it? A roguish perma-progressioner with a touch of deckbuilding. Still, the mix of influences is quite distinctive. I like the idea that I might have to choose between a high-scoring word and a low-scoring word that’ll earn me another relic.</p>

            <p>I have a narcissistic recurring daydream that consists of teleporting historical celebrities into the present so that I can show them bits of 21st century technology and absolutely blow their tiny, primordial minds.</p>
<p>"This deceptively pocket-sized contraption is a trillion times more powerful than your silly adding machines," I would tell Charles Babbage, brandishing my smashed Google Pixel phone. "Did the Wright Flyer have wifi?" I would ask Wilbur and Orville, pushing their faces against the window of a 747. "Put this in your pipe and smoke it," I would tell Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, menacing him with the trailer for Silver Palace, a new open world action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Chinese developers Silver Studio and publishers Elementa, which is notionally set in a Victorian metropolis.</p><!--more-->
<p>Silver Palace's Victorian metropolis has red phoneboxes, elegantly appointed trams, top hats, clocktowers, detectives and ballgowns. I imagine Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could just about keep pace with all that, though he might object to the plunging necklines and the overall loudness of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>But then I would show him the angel-winged anime girls, the power-drifting panther steeds, the neck-snapping finishers, the real-time character-swapping, the demons pretending to people who must be exposed using magic profiling functionality. "Why don't your Sherlock Holmes stories have glide mechanics?" I would sternly enquire of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he curled up sobbing into his hands.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one psychic defence would be to point out that his Sherlock Holmes stories don't contain any gacha mechanics, this being a curse peculiar to our so-called modern age. Fine, Doyle, I'll let you have that one. It's not clear what Silver Palace's gacha elements involve, but here's 11 minutes of gameplay overview to give you a sense of the whole.</p>

<p>Some press release blurb to finish: Silver Palace is the tale of Silvernia, a city powered by the "revolutionary element" of Silverium. You are a Detective who must delve into a shady world of corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, and hidden monsters. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be free-to-play.  There's no release date as yet.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the overclocked character designs but I do like the looks of that urban backdrop. Hopefully the open world element is pronounced enough to allow for a Crackdown-style collectathon. Also please may I have some kind of Watson, Silver Studio? Is that catgirl maid the equivalent of Watson in Silver Palace, and if so, can you please make her as creepy as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-2007">Creepy Watson</a> in Frogwares' games?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> owners will be familiar with the practice of peering into a new game’s Steam store page and hoping, begging, praying to whatever god is yet to abandon this cruel joke of a reality that it has a little green tick mark on it. This is, of course, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a>, wherein Valve gives good behaviour stickers to games that function fully on their handheld PC.</p>
<p>Soon, this system – so often a source of relief and disappointment – will be expanded, with a view to rating games for compatibility with SteamOS as a whole. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">announcement post</a> explains, that’s because the first non-Steam Deck SteamOS handheld, a new version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, is launching soon, with the possibility of more in the future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve’s compatibility testing staff presumably can’t try out every game on every possible SteamOS device, no matter how many wheeled desks they can roll into the office, as it's an open-source operating system that could feasibly run on any desktop or laptop. But they can, and apparently will, use data gleaned from their existing Steam Deck Verified testing to determine whether a game has or avoids problems with the OS in particular, subsequently rating it as either SteamOS Compatible or SteamOS Unsupported. With a nice blue tick for the former, aww. As with the current system’s Verified/Playable/Unsupported ratings, these will appear on store game pages and in the Steam libraries of anyone playing on a non-Steam Deck SteamOS PC.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"We expect over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS Compatible out of the gate," sayeth the post. While these specific new categories don’t take framerate performance or control input functionality into account, as the Steam Deck ratings do, they should at least let you know if certain games are literal non-starters. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> seems due a SteamOS Unsupported tag, for instance, after it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">binned Linux support last year</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried the Legion Go S yet, and our adoptive cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">Ian Games Network</a> weren’t especially impressed with the Windows edition. But the current state of play among portable PCs definitely has SteamOS above Windows 11 as the more usable, comfortable, lightweight, and stable OS. One that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">surprisingly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">capable</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">running</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">non-Steam</a> games, too. As such, I’ll happily get on board with anything that both makes SteamOS patronship slightly easier and might encourage future handheld manufacturers to switch over. Valve expect as much, writing that "the only other officially supported device running SteamOS is Lenovo Legion Go S, but we see this expanding to more devices in the future."</p>
<p>Exciting times, then, if the concept of the Steam Deck has caught your eye but you’d rather wait and see what other hardware makers can do with a baggable form factor <em>and</em> Valve’s own OS. All that being said, one new, lower-spec handheld does not a sea change make, and the recently leaked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-some-leaked-images-of-an-xbox-branded-handheld-and-the-asus-rog-ally-2">Asus ROG Ally 2</a> looks to remain so tied up in Microsoft’s ecosystem that there’s a separate Xbox-branded version of it. Bet it doesn’t have tiny colourful ticks, mind.</p>
