            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> developers at Round8 and Neowiz have received bonuses as a reward for the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Gabbo">Gabbo</a>-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> reaching 3 million cumulative sales across physical and digital on PC and consoles. Cheers, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>As originally reported by South Korean tech site <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/">The Elec</a>, staff have each received a previously arranged 10 million won bonus (about Â£5400) early, alongside two weeks' paid holiday. This is on top of South Korea's mandatory 15 days paid holiday for employees that have been with a company for more than a year.</p>

<p>Additionally, Round8 developers all got Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. We don't usually report on sales figures at RPS, but reading this made me picture an exhausted combat designer grinning and sipping margaritas in the sun while playing Mario Kart for a fortnight, which I consider an image worth sharing.</p>
<p>To spoon Marmite in the margarita somewhat, this obviously also stood out since stories like this can feel like the exception in a landscape where the reward for working on a successful game can just as often be unemployment, as was the case with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">US-based Marvel Rivals dev back in February</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's at least a few devs at Round8 that would have preferred the money over a console - giving out free Switch 2's feels somewhat like a conscious attempt to generate goodfeels press and pizza-party loyalty. Still, Kudos to Neowiz for being chill cool nice good dudes about it: your reward is one goodfeels press. Lies Of P's Overture DLC got a surprise release earlier this month at Medium Geoff's Bad Shoe Jamboree, which turned out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-alone-in-thinking-lies-of-p-overture-is-a-bit-tough-but-an-update-is-coming-to-smooth-things-over">be surprisingly difficult</a> at that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-free-nintendo-switch-2-two-weeks-paid-holiday-and-a-pile-of-money-for-lies-of-p-devs-after-hitting-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Experts urge UK households follow tips to beat heatwave, Dread Spider Tide" screech the inter-tabloids. Sparkling pig-grade hogwash, I say. I've recently discovered that the only things you need to defeat the sun are a cheap space heater set to fan mode and a PC overworked to boiling point, the combination of which creates some sort of mysteriously blissful temperature vacuum. Also, I refuse to open my curtains. For those also working on their attractive monitor-glow sallow tan, here are this week's new PC game releases.</p>
<h2>Monday 23rd June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Today sees the release of  real estate roguelike and Balatro for landlords (Bastardlatro? Fix your own latrino?) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546440/Rentlord/">Rentlord</a>. "Maximize rent, while avoiding taxes!", it urges. I'm reverting to default leftist fist shaking here but the one landlord I've ever had was actually a really nice bloke who once took it upon himself to unblock a sink I'd clogged up with rice. Also, he reminded me strongly of Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/">Darktide's Arbites</a> class is also out. Ah, Games Workshop. The company who only take time off from plagiarising Judge Dredd (and Dune, and Moorcock) to sue individual Etsy users for selling dice with ork faces on them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 24th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Tuesday brings tactical RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Shuffle Tactics</a>, which features both nicely minimal pixel sprites and very good fantasy mammals. It's got deckbuilding too, listing both Final Fantasy Tactics and Slay The Spire as inspirations. There's also more Warty Thou in the form of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622820/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__Lex_Imperialis/">Lex Imperialis</a> story expansion for Owlcat's Rogue Trader. It's also got Arbites in it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498060/Nanomon_Virtual_Pet/">Nanomon Virtual Pet</a> looks cute, if you're bored of all the grimdark cyberdogs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 25th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Free walking sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3739210/Condo/">Condo</a> is about exploring an apartment complex in a bout of insomnia and meeting its inhabitants. It's got a slightly noirish, slightly windowless whiskey bar from Yakuza vibe I'm fond of. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597590/Dungeon_Mori/">Dungeon Mori</a> is a fetching crawler, although perhaps not fetching enough to overcome my inherent racism against fantasy catgirls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 26th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> headlines Thursday. That's the great uncle of immersive sims and Kenny Lemsip's precursor to Bioshock. Immersive sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/">Project Silverfish</a> releases in early access. More importantly, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3808460/Bird_Game/">Bird Game</a>. If you dislike birds and/or games, you can "explore a museum containing the word's greatest collection of toilet art" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3781500/La_Galerie_des_Toilettes/">La Galerie des Toilettes</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 27th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Friday has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1861250/Antro/">Antro</a> inside of it - a rhythmic 2.5d platformer from Barcelona where you're a courier who's also out to overthrow a totalitarian regime. There's also "Untitled Shoes Game" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Bambas</a>. Good one, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bambas-is-untitled-shoes-game">Edwin</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This week the Treehouse is mostly melting. Not me though. I am a very good temperature. Let me know if I've missed any good'uns.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-system-shock-2-remastered-multiple-warhammer-40000-dogs-and-an-unexpected-continuation-of-toilet-theming]]></content:encoded>
