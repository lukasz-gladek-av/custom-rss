            <p>Who mods the mods? A bunch of people, or so was the hope of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON when they released their total conversion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> back in 2024. So far, there've been plenty of tweaks and smaller scale additions to the mod's version of the post-apocalyptic English capital, but no new quests or world expansions of note.</p>
<p>Things playing out that way to this point - despite Team FOLON having <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-british-fallout-making-of-interview">been very open in encouraging other modders</a> to have a go at making such creations - is something Fallout: London project lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter's clearly aware of, and he's offered a few theories as to why it might be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are definitely some cut quests which are not planned in any of the DLCs that could have been implemented, which we have voiced, but that just wasn’t in the scope of what we could do before we moved on as a company," Carter told <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/industry/fallout-london-creator-bethesda-elder-scrolls-vi-fallout-5-gta-london/">Esports.net</a> in a fresh interview. "If a modder wants to get involved in them, they absolutely can. That’s what we’d love to see. We’re modders at the end of the day. We’re never going to say no to other modders wanting to do stuff."</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that, while his team have chatted with "quite a lot of smaller modders", there hasn't been a deluge of folks wanting to flesh out the massive mod with their own extra quests or adventures, as is the case with all of the pro studio-made modern Fallouts. Instead, a glance at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4london">Fallout: London's Nexus Mods page</a> - which I've kept an eye on regularly to see if these sorts of ambitious or creative works pop up - currently turns up just over 600 mods that generally provide handy tweaks to mechanics or fairly compact additions like player homes. There are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/17">a</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/613">few</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/461">mods</a> by a creator called WitherAwayyy I've dug up which could fit the expansion bill, but they remain exceptions to the rule.</p><p>"I’ve heard of people who have been looking into it, and we give advice and help if they ask, but I don’t know of any new worlds or spaces coming up," Carter admitted in this chat. That's no huge issue - Fallout: London's plenty good played in its 'vanilla' state, as Carter reckons a lot of potential modders may simply prefer. That said, it's still an intriguing thing to see play out, given I can't think many other mods off the top of my head which have offered such an expansive opportunity for modding on top of modding.</p>
<p>Though, at this juncture Carter reckons that may well have been another of the limiting factors the mod's modding scene has bumped up against. "I think people are also well aware that, given the nature of how large we built an entire game on top of another game, it’s not the easiest to mod, and there are stability issues that come from building a game on top of a game," he said. The modder also reckons Fallout 4's age has played a role. "It’s a modding scene for a decade-old game. I think a lot of people have moved on," he theorised. "Even ourselves, when you go back to that question of would we do more, the answer is probably not in Fallout 4."</p>
<p>While this may be one area in which Fallout: London simply can't mirror the Fallout entry to which some have compared what the sort of detour it offers Fallout players - Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> - there are still a couple of bits of free Team FOLON-made DLC yet to arrive for it. Last Orders is the first of these and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-next-dlc-last-orders-will-be-served-up-early-this-year-if-current-pint-pulling-plans-hold">should arrive pretty soon</a>, followed at some point down the line by a Yes Man-esque questline in the Wildcard DLC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> recently concluded its first Expedition, this being a voluntary, narrative-led character reset achieved by hoarding and donating resources over a set period. The idea is vaguely that you’re funding a mighty caravan to the boondocks. In return, you’ll get tiered rewards such as faster progression, bonus skill points and a larger stash. Participation in Expedition is split across various stages with different completion requirements – the final leg of the first one saw players amassing non-specific items worth hundreds of thousands of coins.</p>
<p>Being opt-in, Expeditions are designed to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">a gentler alternative</a> to the playerbase-wide seasonal ‘prestiging’ mechanics or progression wipes of other online games. Developers Embark say just over a million people took part in the first Expedition – Arc Raiders has sold around 12 million copies to date – with "something close to about 35% or 40%” of those players bagging the full set of Expedition skill points, in the words of design director Virgil Watkins.</p> <!--more--><p>
I am no StatWhisperer and cannot say whether this is an amazing success, by the standards of games with progress resets. Watkins feels it’s a good start, but also says there’s room for improvement. Specifically, he thinks the closing stage of the inaugural expedition was too much of a slog for pennies.
</p><p>"One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points,” he told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">PCGamesN</a> in a new interview, “and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on."</p>
<p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p><p>Watkins would like future Expeditions to be about more than amassing huge amounts of cash. "We completely acknowledge that it isn't the most engaging thing to just go for money,” he continued, “[and it has] the potential outcome of disincentivizing using your gear, which is kind of what people look forward to towards the end of a reset cycle. So yeah, we're looking at revisions on that." </p>
<p>Aside from going over reactions to the Expedition rewards in themselves, the developers are studying player data to see if they can "bring a little more variety" to the process for more casual Expedition participants. They don’t want these players to “feel as though they're being left [behind]," Watkins said.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m rarely enticed by opportunities to ‘prestige’ a character. I don’t find grinding for the privilege of giving it all away very prestigious. I’d be more interested if there were some degree of mystery involved – perhaps it could be less about building percentages, more about solving an oblique puzzle that requires a resource investment of some kind.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that designing what are broadly exercises in rebalancing an in-game economy takes a lot of skill - Embark have elsewhere talked to us intriguingly about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-hardest-part-of-making-arc-raiders-was-creating-a-meaningful-item-meta-so-that-your-loot-doesnt-just-feel-like-cash">the dark art of creating a “meaningful” item meta</a>. Anyway, did you join the Expedition? How did it go?</p>
