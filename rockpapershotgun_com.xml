            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">Sony</a> have been making a lot of mistakes over the past couple of years, including things like mistakenly thinking they could <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">release 12 live service games by 2026</a>, but the more immediately annoying one is its whole PSN thing. I probably don't need to remind you of that whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fiasco, where they tried to make logging into a PSN a requirement for those on PC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later scrapped this</a> because it went down horrendously. However, there has been one other snag that came with all this PSN nonsense: region locking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Despite being able to play Helldivers 2 without a PSN account, it was still unavailable in almost 180 countries, all of which you can't make a PSN account in (it's still possible to play the game with an account connected, which will likely have factored into the reasoning behind region locking the game). This has applied to Sony's other PC ports of their PlayStation published games, except now, as shared by deals wizard Wario64, it seems a handful of them are now (mostly) region lock free.

There are four total, including the aforementioned <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/?changeid=29555004">Helldivers 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219787/history/?changeid=29555142">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219797/history/?changeid=29555257">Spider-Man 2</a>. Worth keeping in mind that these are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">all games that had their PSN requirements lifted earlier this year</a>. From what I can tell there haven't been any changes made to other PlayStation games based on their logs on SteamDB, but I'm also not entirely sure which games were and weren't region locked, so your mileage may vary with their wider portfolio.
</p>
<p>
It's a good move forward at least! Certainly seems like PlayStation are just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting where their games can actually be bought. Now the big question is whether or not their next big game (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie">that isn't Marathon</a>) on PC will have a PSN requirement at all.

            <p>
There's still a few days to go until <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is unleashed onto the world. Whether it's any good or not in its entirety, we probably won't know for a while yet given that online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of its ilk are always guaranteed to receive numerous patches to iron out some kinks. Our own Nic found a good bit to like about the game in his preview, ignoring the at the time rubbish guns, at the very least.

Whether those tweaks come or not, Remedy have guaranteed one thing: some big free updates with new things to do. Ain't that nice! In the 2025 roadmap, there were a couple of updates outlined for the remainder of the year. The first one, coming in the fall/ autumn, is called Codename "Outbreak". This one brings in a new jobsite, the Research Sector, alongside some new gameplay systems and enemies, and earnable rewards. There'll also be a new paid Classified Requisition, which comes with some armour, skins, and character voice packs - the playable stuff in the update will be completely free though.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The launch of FBC: Firebreak is just the beginning. Have a look at what the post-launch roadmap will look like.</p><p>All playable post launch content in the game is free.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak launches June 17. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBCFirebreak?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FBCFirebreak</a> <a href="https://t.co/bZdliHaOil">pic.twitter.com/bZdliHaOil</a></p></div>— Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames) <a href="https://twitter.com/remedygames/status/1932800170418139480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Then in the winter there's the Codename "Blackout" update. The jobsite for this one hasn't been named, but there'll be even more enemies and rewards, alongside some new equipment. You'll also be able to pick up another paid Classified Requisition.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's communications director shared in a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">separate post</a> that there are plans for more updates in 2026 too, but the teams wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing, for free, in 2026 for FBC: Firebreak." Lots to come it sounds like then!
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak is due out next week, June 17th.
