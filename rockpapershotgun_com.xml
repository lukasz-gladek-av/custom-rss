            <p><em>Beware minor spoilers for Chairbound in this piece. I think they're minor. I have no idea what's truly significant in this dreary purgatory of flourescent lights and rippled glass facades. Only one thing seems guaranteed: I have to get out of here in 10 minutes or I'm doomed.</em></p>
<p>I met the weird little girl again. She was loitering in the shadow of a pillar on the eighth floor. I found her goblin-esque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-strapped-to-a-rolling-office-chair-with-a-ticking-timer-in-a-huge-scary-building">during our first meeting</a>, but up close she seems relatively ordinary, a pale 10-year-old in a nightie with shoulder-length hair. At least, until she burbles distorted sounds at me and runs away into the darkness. I gather she is looking for her "toy". I don't think it's the rubber duck I'm holding.</p><!--more-->
<p>Some other observations about the eighth floor: there are more rubber ducks down here. This is handy intelligence indeed, because it means I don't have to grab the one in the starting office above, saving me 30-60 seconds of abject swivelling and fumbling. I'm still not clear why I would need this rubber duck. It seems perfectly useless. But I don't know for sure that I <em>don't</em> need it, and squeaking the thing pathetically lifts my mood somewhat as I trundle through the office's neat and tidy desolation.</p>
<p>Another thing I've learned: the thing strapped to my chest isn't explosive. When the timer runs down, the display clicks "on", and there's a hiss of initially harmless gas. The first time this happened, I almost died of relief. I figured the timer must have been a prank, a red herring of some kind. Ten minutes to make it down nine stories while tied to a rolling office chair? Of <em>course</em> they were joking. But then my surroundings wobbled and blurred and the shadows took me.</p>
<p>I feel like there must, must be a way to disable this gadget, or extend the timer, because even when I'm being efficient, it takes a good few minutes to descend a single floor. It occurs to me that I dropped the duck on my last attempt, shortly before the gas overwhelmed my senses. Perhaps the duck offers protection from the gas. A voice repeats in my stomach: <em>the duck is the key</em>.</p>

<p>Final observations: I managed to get into some kind of computer room on the eighth floor, just below one of the red lights. It contained a stack of displays and another chair, standing in a pool of what I'm pretty sure is blood. This Bodes, for sure. I don't fancy my chances at fighting anybody or anything off while I'm strapped to this chair. Let's reconvene to compare notes on the seventh floor, assuming I make it.</p>

            <p>Graham is gone. The longest-running editor of Rock Paper Shotgun worked his last day on the website earlier this week, and has leapt quietly into the mysterious realm of the games industry proper. The emotional fallout of this departure is roughly the same as any other time RPS has watched a writer swan-dive out of the RPS treehouse and into the mist far below. There is sadness tinged with hope. "There goes another one," you think, smiling through a single tear and imagining their future life far from these branches. </p>
<p>Only this time, well, it's Graham.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Brendan:</strong> I officially quit RPS myself back in 2019, but have since reappeared as a regular freelance phantom. This gives me the weird opportunity to write a goodbye post for the man who wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brendan-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye">my own goodbye post</a>. Fuck you, Graham, I see your compliments, and I raise you. Eat it.</p>
<p>Back in the horrendous mists of 2014, Graham jumped ship as editor of PC Gamer. He was hired by the ancient founders of Rock Paper Shotgun because the ancient founders were terrible at spreadsheets and were always standing in the wrong place. In Graham Smith, they not only got a managing editor who could tell them what day of the week it was, but a writer who was able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/worst-game-names">eviscerate developers for their terrible names</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-me-more-expressive-actions-in-videogames-please">champion funny new ways to play</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-nidhogg">celebrate the best games of all time</a>, all with the same decorous lethality. </p>
<p>Go through Graham's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/graham-smith">entire author archive</a> and you will find over 4000 articles that collage into a vivid desire for this industry to be more than it often is. Indie physics brawlers stand side-by-side with EA shooters in a swirling list of cool or heinous shit that was important enough to tell you about. Few can write this much this well for this long, and not emerge a master of the knife-like phrase. </p>
<p>"Fuck underscore that," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-pc-review">Watch_Dogs</a>.</p>
<p>Reviewing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/proverbs-review">picrossy game Proverbs</a> he wrote: "It was there when I closed my eyes, as if my brain was defragmenting."</p>
<p>"Makes me feel like I'm on hold," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naiad-review">the wholesome nothingness of Naiad</a>.</p>
<p>I'm picking these articles basically at random. They are probably not the pieces Graham is most proud of writing - only he knows those. But it says a lot that I can dig through his archives in a single morning and find, so easily and quickly, countless examples of wit, energy, and humanity. A humanity that he often expressed privately in our daily meetings, rather than on these digipages. God I wish we'd recorded our meetings as a podcast. We would have broken SO many NDAs. </p>
<p>When I say "humanity" I mean just that. Graham knows that when you write about games, you're really writing about yourself.</p>
<p>"I'm reminded of how precious it is to play a videogame and never need to compete," he wrote of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-living-minecraft">Minecraft in 2014</a>, not knowing then that exploring those mountains and valleys would years later become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-is-turning-15-so-theyre-giving-away-some-character-creator-items">a regular ritual with his son</a>. "Minecraft is a toybox, a dressing-up box, a pencil case of colouring pens, and sometimes just a sunny hill. I played it in 2009 and I played it yesterday and I have no reason to doubt I'll be playing it in 2039." </p>
<p>As somebody who has freelanced for this beautiful cesspit since its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130501155136/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">scrappy red-faced days</a>, I also know the good Graham has done not as a writer, but simply as a guy who can get things done. He dragged this place kicking and screaming into a modern internet that none of us could avoid. Remember when RPS was a traditional blog? It was great. But articles would more or less evaporate when they left the front page. There was only space for three top stories at any one time. Graham oversaw the site as it got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119123851/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">an even bigger splash of top stories</a>. Some readers frothed at the mouth to see the blog roll pushed further down the landing page, reacting with that familiar viciousness we have grown to find adorable in you over years of subsequent RPS facelifts, minor and drastic. But, oh, whaddya know? YOU MOTHER FUCKERS CLICKED ON THOSE TOP STORIES DIDN'T YOU? You filthy, lovely, loyal dirtbags. It is for you Graham killed our darlings. Change is neither good or bad. Change is simply change.</p>
<p>When Graham was first hired, his welcome post wrote that "the tragedy of being editor of any magazine is it dramatically reduces the amount of writing you get to do" and this curse threatened to come to pass when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-not-editor-in-chief-of-rps-anymore-heres-who-is">ascended into the white halls of corpomanagement</a> eight years later to become a bigger, badder directorial man. But the truth is, Graham never stopped writing. He kept doing news posts at nights and weekends. He kept writing news. He kept crushing expensive action adventures and toothless indie darlings with equal knuckle-cracking insight. Okay, he took a hiatus from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-sunday-papers">Sunday Papers column</a> (one of the site's longest traditions) but even that didn't last. </p>
<p>It's in those Sunday Papers pieces that I feel you get the most bang for your Graham buck. Rock Paper Shotgun has always been the home of great writing, and perhaps nobody has built the site's editorial ruleset as much as Graham (with the possible exception of Alice O'Connor, who wrote over 8000 articles and the style guide we use to this day - an untouchable legacy). His <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">final Sunday Papers last week</a> is a fangs-out manifesto for games journalism, and if there is any young pup who still covets this job over the glamour of being an influencer or the solitude of being a video essayist, then their greatest hope for honing their craft lies in Graham's words.</p>
<p>"There are infinite ways to play a game and none of them are wrong," he says. "There are infinite ways to write about a game and some of them are wrong, but you have to decide what those are for yourself."</p>
<p>Or you can just ask Graham. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grahamsmith.bsky.social">follow him, and whatever he'll be doing next, on Bluesky</a>. I suggest you do. Words will burst out of this man if he doesn't write them down somewhere. You'll want to be there when he pops.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I'm still relatively new to the Treehouse and have known Graham for fewer months and years than the other folks here, thus rendering me incapable of writing anything as poetic as Bendy's ode above. But as someone who's read RPS since ye olden days prior to actually getting a job here, I've felt Graham's presence on the site for a long time, and it's been a superb guiding light.</p>
<p>As a fella who also had a long career working in non-games journalism, I feel compelled to add that I've suffered under the hands of many bad editors, and Graham was not one of those. He is the rarest of beasts, the ultimate of Achievements - an actual Chaotic Good guy-in-charge who cares not only about this bizarre corner of the internet, but the people behind it. A real one, in other words. We'll miss you, Graham, and now that you have left us I am currently gathering healing potions to prepare for our swift descent into Lord of the Flies territory.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Graham, I will miss all those moments in meetings when I'd try to act wise about video games journalism - sorry, videogames journalism - and shame-facedly realise that you'd heard it all before, probably a dozen times over, from successive generations of RPS scribes, all the way back through the great Google Meet invite list of History. You have absorbed everything worth knowing about this business, and it is only fit that you depart for a kinder realm, where you can enjoy your Crunchyroll subscription in peace, and spend less time fielding complaints about deal posts. Please shine down on us occasionally, great beardfather in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> If Jeremy's still new to the Treehouse, my feet have barely cleared the topmost rung of the ladder into it as I write this. I'm sad I didn't get to work with Graham for a lot longer, even if just to try and glean more of the secrets that inevitably lurk within his face fuzz by staring at it in morning meetings.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Looking at RPS from the outside in, Graham’s influence is far-reaching and obvious – there’s a reason this site has kept on trucking as long as it has, and that reason has a rich beard and an impressive collection of graphic tees.</p>
<p>I wish that everyone currently saying their goodbyes also knew the full extent of Graham’s impact behind the scenes, that they might clap and wave just that little bit harder. Relatively few people see the Graham that so effortlessly elevates our good ideas (while tactfully squishing our bad ones), or the Graham that lets us disappear for days on end, no questions asked, when things go wrong at home. Or the Graham that always encourages us down the most honest, integrity-paved road through an industry that often isn’t just unconducive to the principles of good reporting, but actively hostile towards them.</p>
<p>We’ll be fine – he’s seen to that too. But when you think of Graham the writer and editor, know that you can also think of Graham the leader, Graham the shield, Graham the engine. Let’s thank him once again, for all that and more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/graham-smith-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, if your hearing's recovered enough from the sheer blaring blastiness of yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal</a>, I'm here to tell you a couple of things you'll probably be happy about. Well, unless you're planning on buying it from the Epic Games store.</p>
<p>You see, amid last night's info drop, EA have revealed at least an estimate of the specs your hardware'll need to have to run it, as well as the very important detail of whether you'll need to fire it up via (whispers) the EA launcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While EA haven't included any PC specs in their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">lengthy Q&amp;A post</a> about the game, declaring that they'll provide more info further down the line, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/">Steam page</a> has had minimum and recomended setups added to it. Battle in fields 6's minimum reqs comprise the following: an Intel Core i5-7600K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, 16GB of RAM, 55GB of storage space on a hard drive or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> running at least Windows 10, and your choice of an Nvidia RTX 2060 or an AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB.</p>
<p>Judging by those, provided your rig's not beyond half a decade old, there's a chance you'll not need to look into upgrading to pass the low threshold required to at least get BF6 running, though EA don't specify the kind of quality and FPS count bang you can expect for that buck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recomended specs as as follows: Intel Core i7-10700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processors, 16GB of RAM, 80GB of drive space, Windows 11, and either an Nvidia RTX 3060Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT. Again, no indication as to what that'll get you, aside from suggesting it should be decent. That said, buggy Battlefield launches have been a thing in the past. Our James only ran into one while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">diving into the multiplayer at a recent Battlevent</a>, though.</p>
<p>If you've been more worried about having to summon EA's app every time you want to play it, then the good news is that if you're on Steam that won't be necessary.. Though you will still need an EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot apparently once said, man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest. Those who buy it via the Epic Store'll need both EA app and EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot definitely didn't say, sorry Fortnite platform peeps.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I go, EA also make clear that "you do not need to have played any other Battlefield game to understand or enjoy Battlefield 6". It's unclear whether an understanding of the concept of a battlefield, or the individual concepts of battles or fields will be required. I'm going out on a slightly exploded limb to say probably not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app]]></content:encoded>
