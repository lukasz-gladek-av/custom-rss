            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developers Gearbox have chucked more wrenches at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s PC performance over the weekend, following issues that've landed it mixed Steam review fortunes since launch last week. However, if you're looking for patch notes, you're gonna be a bit disappointed. Ah well, at least there are essay-length Randy Pitchford Twitter threads to scroll through if you're partial to someone waffling about how the game runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Initially, Gearbox's response to the PC performance problems was to publish a massive recommended settings table. Our James had a go at seeing if following it made a tangible difference. While you can and should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">read his full testing write-up </a>, the short version is that the stuttering many players have reported wasn't magically wiped away by that guidance.
</p>
<p>Cue this latest update, which as Gearbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802578411?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>, aims to "help improve stability for a wide range of PCs". Unlike most patches, they declined to get into any nitty-gritty specifics beyond that. There's a warning that whenever you change your graphics settings, it can take up to 15 minutes for your shaders to recompile, as well as a reposting of those optimisation guides for <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/amd-optimization/">AMD</a> hardware.</p>
<p>Aside from those, the studio added: "We’re continuing to read your feedback, planning additional updates and will have more details to come". So, no bullet-pointed patch notes to illustrate exactly how the update's gone about trying to make things run in a more stable fashion, which seems a strange choice and has understandably raised eyebrows among <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngje07/borderlands_4_update_notes/">some</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngdo16/bl4_new_patch_steam/">players</a>.</p><p>Who needs full patch notes, however, when you've got Gearbox CEO yammering into the void about Borderlands 4 on the socials. He has at least emphasised that the studio are putting in "significant work on PC performance". Though, that did come midway through an essay-length thread that began with the declaration: "Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>After shouting at anyone who's assumed that PCs between minimum and recommended specs "can achieve all of extremely high frame rate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution", the tweetman asserted that "there are a few real issues, but they are affecting a very, very small percentage of users."</p><p>

In other Borderlands 4 launch-related news, publishers Take-Two took the opportunity to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-no-spyware-in-borderlands-4-take-two-insist-following-upset-over-terms-of-service">reiterate they aren't in the "spyware" business</a> via the game's terms of service agreement. That followed some concern over the contents of such Take-Two docs in terms of data collection earlier this year, with some older Borderlandses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">briefly being review-bombed</a>.
