            <p>The requirements for your PC to feast on the treefrogs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </a>tactical espionage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> have been revealed. The minimum specs ask for a RTX 2060 Super, same as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-performance-best-settings">The Great Troy Bake Off</a>. While this might sound like Delta is following the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in requiring ray tracing, producer Noriaki Okamura <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">told Eurogamer last year</a> that no ray tracing features are included - so the RTX requirement is likely down to Unreal 5's Lumen lighting tech (although that can <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine">include ray tracing techniques</a> anyway.)</p>
<p>You can find the full requirements below and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">on Steam here</a>, in a notably less attractive font than classic Rock Paper Sans.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows® 10, Windows® 11 (64-bit OS required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong> RTX 2060 Super (8GB)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100 GB available space</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD Recommend</li>

<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> requires just 8 GB? It's not entirely fair to compare the two, I just wanted to marvel at that install size. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-requirements-revealed">Eurogamer note</a> that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-system-requirements-are-here-and-its-yet-another-game-that-requires-an-rtx-graphics-card-and-tonnes-of-free-storage-to-play/">PC Gamer note</a> and RPS is now noting, Delta uses Unreal 5 instead of the studio's previous FOX engine, and Unreal 5's (usually optional) Lumen lighting requires an RTX 2000-series or later card if you want to use its hardware-based ray tracing effects. Eurogamer also note that the PC version includes the Snake vs Monkey minigame with Ape Escape characters, although the ancient Bomberman fan in me is a little jealous that that minigame is exclusive to Xbox.</p>

            <p>The upcoming reboot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a>, the fantasy role-playing game of British chortles 'n' chuckles, has been delayed until next year, says head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan. Developers Playground Games need "more time" to create the world of Albion, it turns out, but Xbox has offered a sparse sprinking of of game footage as compensation for the delay. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing among it. Some combat, some vistas. But it's something.</p>

<p>"We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025," said Duncan in an interview during the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8?feature=shared&amp;t=857">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. "We are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait... I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team."</p>
<p>Duncan goes on to talk over some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h77gcgE1b8">pre-alpha footage of the RPG</a>. There are scenes of the player character walking through a city, riding their horse, and fighting what looks like various fantasy staples such as werewolves and goblins. At one point the player is being accosted by a giant violent chicken, which fans of the old games will undoubtedly welcome with feathery fondness (the humble chicken is the butt of many jokes, basically a series mascot). At another point the hero is using sausages in a frying pan as bait in a bear trap. I can cofirm this is how the British aristocracy spend their time ever since fox hunting got banned.</p>
<p>Playground Games are best known for their work on the Forza racing games, which are often hyper-realistic and glistening with The Graphics. Which would be why Duncan reassures prospective players that their RPG will be "the most beautifully realized version of Albion you've ever seen". That werewolf's hair is very detailed, to be fair. But as ever we'll reserve judgement until we get our hands on the beast ourselves.</p>
<p>The Fable reboot was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brand-new-fable-announced-for-pc-and-xbox">officially announced in 2020</a> but there had been rumours about it as far back as 2017. We've seen a couple of cinematic trailers since the announcement, starring the likes of comedy actors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-trailer-doesnt-have-much-fable-does-have-richard-ayoade">Richard Ayoade</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g">Matt King</a>. But now it'll be a whole other year until we see if their jokes land.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
