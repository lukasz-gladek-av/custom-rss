Right, sorry parents that proudly put their kids' borderline impressionist drawings on the fridge, there's a new bare minimum you have to meet. If you're not turning your child's drawings into full on video games, then I'm sorry to say you're not doing a good enough job. This doesn't apply to Artur Latkovsky, though, who is quite literally doing that with his game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/odd-dorable">Odd Dorable</a> (I'm sure I don't need to explain the name to you), a game where every single bit of art in the game was made by his four-year-old daughter.
</p>

<p>
Now, here's the thing: the art is very obviously something drawn by a four-year-old. You're not going to boot Odd Dorable up and think "wow, she's only four and she drew this?" It so clearly was! And yet, it is immediately, infinitely charming because it is raw, unfiltered art made by someone that doesn't have any preconceived notions of, well, presumably just about most things.

Latkovsky describes it as an "open-world exploration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game" where you have to help a princess find all her lost candies. I can't quite tell you what those puzzles will be like, details are pretty light, but given the involvement of a literal child in the developmental process, I'm going to assume they're not going to be all that complicated. 
</p>
<p>
The real hook here is the improvisational nature of it all. Latkovsky explained in a Reddit post that he even tries to get art drawn by his daughter on concrete into the game. Another example is that his daughter drew a dinosaur with fairy wings who is guarding a space rocket, so of course that gets added in. I mean, isn't this every child's dream? To tell someone all of the ridiculous ideas you have and they make them real? Good stuff, even if the kid is technically being paid in candies according to Latkovsky.
</p>
<p>
It'll also be quite a short game, capping out at around an hour, purposefully designed to be "digestible", so don't expect too much from it when it apparently arrives in September this year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690890/Odd_Dorable/">here</a> if you're as charmed as I am.

Horror asymmetric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary later this year, an amount of time so large it really makes you think "man, most live service devs should have had the foresight to make their game a decade ago, huh?" With that anniversary approaching imminently, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/behaviour-interactive">Behaviour Interactive</a> held a year nine anniversary broadcast where there was one reveal that'll have you going "yeah that makes sense" and another where you'll say "ok, sure."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The first one is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> villain Springtrap is coming to the game as a new killer, an addition that feels so obvious I'm not sure why it's taken this long. It seems like they're taking some cues from the movie for this one, as Matthew Lillard is actually reprising his role as the character from the film adaptation. Details like Springtrap's moveset and a release date are being withheld for an incoming livestream, but there's a legendary outfit planned alongside the Yellow Rabbit version from the film. Oh, and of course there'll be a map based on the Freddy Fazbear's restaurant too.

Here's the weird one: it's another collaboration, this time with The Witcher of all series. No, you won't be running around as Geralt or anything, it's coming in the form of a few costumes. Survivor Vittorio Toscano is getting an outfit based on Geralt's, with other outfits planned based on characters like Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. This one's just a bit odd! The Witcher games aren't horror, so it just feels a bit like suits swinging around properties they own just because they can.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, a few other updates are planned throughout the rest of the year, with June seeing a rework of The Archives and adjusted gamma settings, alongside other updates further down the line allowing for more spectators in custom matches, rebalancing for map and key items, and a few other bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new chapter coming in 2026 where you (yes, even you) will be able to take part in a choose-your-own-adventure style activity to vote on different aspects of a new killer and survivor. TLDR: Lots on the way!
