            <p>
Publishers Slitherine and developers The Artistocrats have launched one of those high-fadoodling "2.0" updates for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starship-troopers-terran-command">Starship Troopers - Terran Command</a>, their violently arachnophobic real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> from 2022. It introduces Territory Mode, which sees you defending three planets featured in the base game and two expansions, and brags of "a level of personalization and replayability never before seen in Terran Command".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Basically, its reshuffles the game into more of an open-ended roguelite thingy. "Instead of following one scripted mission after another, players now decide where and how to strike the Bugs and wipe out their nests in an open strategic campaign," Sky Marshal Rosco J. Press Release bellows in my ear. "Battles can be fought across the galaxy, with each planet offering its own distinct set of maps, objectives, and unique Arachnid threats--ensuring that no two campaigns ever feel the same."
</p>
<p>
In Territory Mode, you'll have to secure and defend Territory Points that generate income of a new resource that is used to recruit units, reinforce squads, and unlock new techs. The opposing Arachnids, meanwhile, will grow in power as the campaign goes on.
</p>
<p>
Territory Mode also divides the existing base game and DLC units, turrets and abilities into Battle Groups, which "function like specialized factions" and add "character-based elements and super innovative tactical options to every deployment".
</p>
<p>
It all sounds reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>'s post-release Kingdom Mode, albeit not quite as lavish in its reframing. The requirement that you own the DLC to get full use of Territory Mode is obnoxious - there are 11 maps in the base game, nine maps in the Raising Hell DLC, and seven maps in the Urban Onslaught DLC. All the units for each Battle Group are split across the DLCs as well.  
</p><p>
Still, we liked the original Terran Command, with Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starship-trooper-terran-command-review">calling it</a> a "solid, slightly chaotic RTS that nails some satisfying tactical stand up bugfights, but could use a little more bite". The original game and DLC are on discount till October 28th. You can buy the whole lot for £39.13, €45.47 or $46.77. Would <em>you</em> like to know more? Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/">Steam</a> page, then.
</p>
<p>
Slitherine are calling Terran Command's second com(mand)ing the heart of an "RTS Renaissance", which also apparently includes their Cameron-era roboherder Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance and Steel Balalaika's recent Broken Arrow, which I hadn't heard of till now, and which doesn't appear to have John Travolta in it.</p>
<p>"Slitherine has truly become the essential home for all RTS enthusiasts, and our continuous free support is how we repay the passion of this community," beams publishing director Marco Alessandro Minoli. "We are here to ensure that the genre thrives." Inspiring! Do you feel like we're in an RTS Renaissance? I am declaring this the Renaissance of overcompensatory PR.
