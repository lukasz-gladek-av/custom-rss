            <p>It's pointless me trying to sum this game up before you've clapped the lips of your eyes around it and taken a long drag. There's a trailer below. Do it now. Nod if you've done so. Right, that was Soul Injector Commando, a video game about shooting some semblance of everyday humanity into the bodies of the billionaires who're behind all of the world's problems.</p>

<p>You are the Soul Injector Commando, brought back from the dead by god themselves and sent to a bunker. All of the rich bellends have been handily lured there by an audacious fake meteorite prank worthy of enshrinement atop the YouTube algorithm until the end of time. You romp through, soul injecting until you can soul inject no more.  </p>
<p>There a nine levels to get through, filled with these malcontents who'll "become normal humans, get normal jobs, and be happy" if you succeed. At your disposal are a number of different weapons and upgrades, fully voice acted dialogue I assume will help you tell them the error of their ways, and time trials to try if you get through a bout of soul injecting and decide you'd like to try that level again.</p><p>And, to be frank, why wouldn't you? I can't see the likes of being assembled by a dino head with six arms, blasting your way through a supermarket while coins flick around and a big bowl guy waves a gloved hand in joy/resignation, or driving a tiny SUV with wings getting old quickly. Ditto splattering execs as a sentient golf ball, encountering what looks like an intergalactic skeletal drummer, or fighting whatever the head thing that pops up around the minute mark is. I've not even mentioned the two-headed butterfly knight creature.</p>
<p>To bring us back down to Earth a bit, Soul Injector Commando's the latest work of developer and artist <a href="https://www.jeremycouillard.com/">Jeremy Couillard</a>, who's got a well-honed knack for the surreal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014570/AlienAfterlife/">AlienAfterlife</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188760/JEF/">JEF</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1506080/Fuzz_Dungeon/">Fuzz Dungeon</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164310/Escape_From_Lavender_Island/">Escape From Lavender Island</a>, and the snappily-named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789380/Sometimes_to_Deal_with_the_Difficulty_of_Being_Alive_I_Need_to_Believe_There_Is_a_Possibility_That_Life_Is_Not_Real/">Sometimes to Deal with the Difficulty of Being Alive, I Need to Believe There Is a Possibility That Life Is Not Real</a>. They're all now on my wishlist, and not solely because their art styles are 90% made up of things that my uncle's prog rock band would've given anything to put on their album covers.</p>
<p>Soul Injector Commando doesn't have a release date yet. It strikes me as the kind of game that'll just rock up instantly whenever the universe needs it to. Until then, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3220370/Soul_Injector_Commando/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developers Sandfall Interactive have wheeled out news that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'ll be getting a free update which'll include a new location for its party to explore, more boss battles, and some extra costumes. The studio are teasing that there'll be other stuff packed into this update, which they say is designed to act as a thank you to folks who've delved into the Belle Époque Frenchness.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche told our mates/mortal enemies over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Euro Truck Gamer 2</a>. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now." He added that this update is "not a super big DLC extension with hours of content", but will contain "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well", so set your expectations right in the middle.</p>
<p>The studio have <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive">confirmed some of the stuff that'll be in there</a>. "A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover," is the headliner, but some extra boss battles to challenge late game grinders are giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>The expeditioneers - no idea if they're ever called that in the game, but I'm rolling with it - will get some new clothes to rock. Text and interface localisation in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian is also incoming. Sandfall have teased that there'll be more things, but they're not revwheeling those things yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Nic had some words about Clair Obscur when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">reviewed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Very occasionally, I'll play an RPG that makes me feel ten again. Rebirth. Cris Tales. Revisiting Suikoden. Years come, the big number ticks down, and comfortable appreciation replaces the spellbound enchantment of being told a story, of being swept off to a new world. Of playing Final Fantasy 8 in that special edition shirt that Ben Starr likes to wear that I wish I'd kept because I bet it's worth a bloody fortune now. You wait for a game to bring you back there, mostly certain you've moved passed the capacity to feel that way because you now have the sort of adult concerns that cause you ask how much a shirt might be worth on Ebay. I can't say if Clair Obscur will work its magic on everyone the same way, but it certainly did for me. I'm still not ready to leave, honestly. What a special and rare thing this is: a story that feels like someone wanted to tell it so badly it hurt.</blockquote>
<p>Come on dude, stop sitting on the fence and give us some indication of how you feel.</p>
<p>This free Clair Obscur update's got no release date or estimate attached yet, so it'll definitely arrive after Nic achieves the power to reach through my screen, grab me by the collar, and tell me he thought the game was the term above good.</p>

            <p>Paradox have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s All Under Heaven DLC, the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s "largest expansion" ever, which extends its dynastic soap opera to medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia. The map expansion is coming on 28th October. It's the first time the series has ventured to these latitudes, which seem a little incompatible with the European crusader premise. It also introduces Japanese language support.

<p>In a disgraceful betrayal of Rock Paper Shotgun's fine editorial traditions, I have yet to complete a single game of Crusader Kings 3. Every time I feel like trying, somebody says something like "oh great, let us know when your spymaster has an affair with himself", and I retreat frowning into the bushes. Still, I do like the sound of an expansion that encompasses the river valleys of China, Mount Fuji, and the Great Wall.
</p>
<p>"Keep a steady hand on the regional hegemon or manage the tumult of dynastic change in China," Paradox's emissary explained to us, before I had him thrown in an iron maiden. "Revere the Yamato emperor and his regent in Japan, or pursue the path of the samurai warlord. Build a monumental temple facility in the jungles of Southeast Asia and compel weaker kingdoms to pay tribute to your greatness."
</p>

<p>There's more in the press release from game director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia," he comments, rudely undermining my observation up the page about this being an unlikely staging ground for a kingly crusade. Watch your tone, Alexander. We always have an iron maiden going spare.
</p>
<p>Let's all celebrate these fulsome tidings in the traditional medieval style, with a banquet of freshly laid and hard-boiled bulletpoints, covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>China: The Mandate of Heaven</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ascend to the highest tier of power with the new Hegemony title, reigning supreme over all empires in the Chinese region.</li>
<li>Navigate the Dynastic Cycle, a living system of stability and chaos. Exploit periods of instability to rise to power and reshape the political landscape.</li>
<li>Explore the Celestial government system, unique to China. Earn Merit through deeds or the Imperial Examinations, gaining favor and influence.</li>
<li>Manage the Imperial Treasury to fund Great Projects, defend against disasters, or expand your influence with statecraft and might.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Japan: Rise of the Shogunate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Take control of a Japanese house and forge your destiny. Rise through the intricate courtly system to become a mighty Shogun or Kampaku regent.</li>

<p>The price tag is just as hefty as the expansion itself - $29.99, £24.99 or €29.99. Alternatively, you can get it in the Crusader Kings III: Chapter IV expansion pass. I'm not sure I'd pay £24.99 for the Great Wall - I hear it was more effective as a psychological deterrent than a literal obstacle. Still, you do you.
