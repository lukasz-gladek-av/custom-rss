Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.

Global community director at CD Projekt Red Marcin Momot <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">took to Jitter</a> to share that the team is "not done yet! Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.

I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.
