<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s latest patch, version 1.01.1, makes the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> somewhat easier for single player Nightreigners. It boosts the number of runes awarded for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-guide#how-to-play-solo">Nightreign solo expeditions</a>, and gives you one free automatic revive per boss battle. A great day indeed for people who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">wish the game's multiplayer were still more in-game covenant than feature</a>.</p>
<p>By strange coincidence, the odds that I will actually play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> have now gone up 1.011 times. I was pretty disenchanted by Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a>, in which he summarised the game's Extended Fromverse battle royale bum-rushing as "a stripped-off part of FromSoft's creative identity with little appeal absent the whole". If they can significantly decrease the reliance on jolly cooperation I'll be much more interested - I had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-is-the-secret-long-lost-cousin-of-metal-gear-solid-5">similar feelings</a> about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - though this still feels like a game I'm comfortable skipping.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not just you chum-deficient Let Me Solo Her-mits who are benefiting from the latest patch. From Software have also done minimum-spec players a solid by sorting out a bug that caused rendering problems on low graphics quality settings. What's more, they have "fixed a bug where the Climb up action sometimes failed when using the keyboard", and "a bug where the Climb up action was difficult to perform when using a gamepad". Sing out if this particular fumble has ever cost you a match.
</p>
<p>
All that's in addition to some rebalanced rewards: you'll be able to earn more high-rarity Relics when reaching expedition day 3, and it's now more likely you'll obtain those high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones bought at the Small Jar Bazaar. You can read the full patch notes, including a list of smaller bugfixes, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">over yonder</a>.

<p>If you are hell-bent on facing Elden Ring Nightreign's various murderbeasts all on your lonesome, allow me to take your elbow and usher you towards our round-up of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-solo-character">best Elden Ring Nightreign solo characters</a>. Ollie Toms died a million times researching that piece.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears Of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developers People Can Fly are cancelling two video game projects and laying people off due to "a lack of communication" from one game's publisher, and "a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds" for the other.</p><!--more-->
<p>The projects in question were codenamed Gemini and Bifrost. It's not clear what either of them involved. People Can Fly haven't named the aforementioned publisher, but Square Enix were <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/strategy-update/">listed as Gemini's publishers back in January 2023</a>. Here's a gristly slab of industryspeak from CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski, via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/people-can-fly_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334906069715972096-lZaD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project."</p></blockquote>
<p>To rephrase the above in language my puny microchip-deficient brain can withstand, Wojciechowski is essentially saying that the publishers have stopped talking and left the developers in doubt about whether they want to publish the game at all. For context, a rider is an addition or amendment to a primary contract. As for "further milestones", this presumably refers to an agreement on what the publishers would pay People Can Fly in return for reaching certain stages in the game's development. </p>
<p>As for Bifrost, this "was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project," Wojciechowski continues.</p>
<p>"As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most."</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of cancellations and layoffs from People Can Fly. In January last year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">dismissed 30 people</a> who were working on Gemini. In April 2024, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">washed their hands of Project Dagger</a>, a Take-Two Interactive joint. And in December 2024, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">laid off over 120 people</a> and shelved another game. All this followed a period of expansion that saw the studio grow to over 600 people and seven projects as of July 2023.</p>
<p>Gears Of War: E-Day (aka Project Maverick) is a return to roots, of sorts - back in 2011-2013, People Can Fly collaborated with original Gears devs Epic on Gears Of War: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judgment">Judgment</a>, though how much of the Judgment team remains at PCF is anybody's guess. As Coalition studio head Mike Crump <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-to-co-develop-gears-of-war-e-day-following-spate-of-layoffs-and-cancellations-last-year">commented back at announcement</a>, "we’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p>
<p>While the scale of the layoffs is undetermined, a number of former Bifrost and Gemini contributors have spoken publicly about their time with People Can Fly, praising the departing staffers on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>"Although I was only part of Project Bifrost for two short weeks before being laid off last Dec, I could clearly see how talented, passionate, and capable the team was," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lipan-liu-rock-d-1a15aa95_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334986446140776448-PYWW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">writes</a> concept artist Lipan Liu. "It was a group filled with amazing developers, and the project itself had so much potential. It's hard to believe it ended this way."</p>
<p>Writer and designer James B Jones <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamesbertonjones_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334982833700032512-9N_h?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">adds</a> that "though my time at PCF was relatively brief, the folks I worked with on Project Gemini were S-tier talent and even better people." Best of luck to all affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You know how it is: you rush to the bus stop because you think you're going to miss it, then it arrives 12 years late. Typical. The makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> have shown off a short trailer with a big shiny European coach in it. It confirms that the sim will add driveable buses in some form soon, fulfilling a long-forgotten tease that was first made by the developers back in the cloudy days of 2013. </p>

<p>The trailer was included in a brief <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/547862446583318213?snr=1_5_9_">update post on Steam</a>, showing a big white bus pulling out from behind a Scania truck. Surprise! The game is basically now Euro Truck And/Or Bus Simulator 2. </p>
<p>"We’ve crossed borders, hauled freight, and explored countless cities across Europe," say developers SCS Software. "But just like any great journey, the road is always full of surprises. Something different is pulling into view, a new way to experience the world of Euro Truck Simulator 2. See you at the next stop."</p>
<p>The devs haven't said exactly what form the buses will take, or which lurching road carriages will appear (please, not Megabus) but it'll likely be a big DLC pack. It is the culmination of a desire the developers seem to have harboured for over a decade. They first pondered the possibility of adding buses back in February 2013, writing in <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2013/02/a-coach-bus.html">a blog post</a> they were "exploring an opportunity to go beyond just trucks" and saying they were off "recording sounds and taking tons of photos of a Scania Touring HD Bus". But it looks like those plans got delayed on the roadside until now. </p>
<p>It's a pleasant possibility to some but not surprising to all. Some players have noted the appearance of more detailed bus stops along their usual trucking routes in recent updates, and say the bussification of the sim makes sense. Although others in the game's Steam forums seem grumpy that buses aren't getting their own dedicated sim. However you feel, it's a move that's in keeping with the studio's recent plans for their other sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, which plans to introduce driveable pickup trucks and other smaller cars as part of <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/04/project-road-trip.html">a "Road Trip" expansion</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
