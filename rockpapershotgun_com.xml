            <p>One of the many game studios smashed to pieces by Embracer Group has come back to life. Campfire Cabal, which was seemingly shut down in 2023 as part of their parent corporation's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">scorched earth "restructuring" policy</a>, have crawled out of the grave to announce they're still around and, in fact, "never stopped working". They've been making a new game in the Expeditions series of historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, and have been given "the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are finally ready to reveal that Campfire Cabal was never shut down," say the studio in <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/">a post on their website</a>. What happened, they say, is that the THQ-owned studio were ordered to close by Embracer two years ago. But some agreement was reached to keep the company going with a reduced headcount, and they instead cut an unknown number of employees from payroll. </p>
<p>"Though we did have to say goodbye to many of our colleagues, the studio survived and a compact team continued the project we had started in 2022. At the end of March of 2025, we received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<p>That project is a new game in the Expeditions series of RPGs, which includes the classical centurion stomping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-rome">Expeditions: Rome</a>, the top-down shield-battering of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-viking">Expeditions: Viking</a>, and gunpowdery land-grabbing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-conquistador">Expeditions: Conquistador</a>. The studio aren't saying much more about the new game, though. Only that it'll be "set in a new period of our history and in a new part of the world for the series". Expeditions: Mongol, anyone? Expeditions: Pirate? Expeditions: Islamic Golden Age? I guess we'll find out.</p>
<figure>

<p>Expeditions: Rome had some repetitive quirks but was a "seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times," said Nate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/expeditions-rome-review">our review</a>. And Expeditions: Conquistador was called "very fine" by Adam, who wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-expeditions-conquistador">his review</a> that some parts were a chore, but "the focus on stories and characters means that there is almost always at least one interesting plot on the boil". </p>
<p>You should know, however, that Campfire Cabal aren't the original studio who made the older Expeditions games. That would be Logic Artists, who were subsumed and digested by blockchain bullshit peddlars Dynasty Studios. But the Cabal have since become custodians of the series under rights-holders THQ. As with many creative studios, it's a bit of a Ship of Theseus situation, somewhat complicated by a round of layoffs and this subsequent reappearance. We'll have to wait and see how the next entry carries the torch.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't that interested in the RPGs, the "revival" of a seemingly shuttered studio is interesting in a wider sense. It could be seen as a hopeful sprout of green emerging from a blackened earth laid bare by years of seemingly endless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>. Or it could simply be the re-emergence of a scarred and injured body from a bloody-watered moat, a studio bravely limping on in spite of the brutal overlord that threw them in there, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">bodies</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>AMD have rocked up to this year’s Computex tech conference with a <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1253/amd-introduces-new-radeon-graphics-cards-and-ryzen-threadripper-processors-at-computex-2025">handful of new Ryzen Threadripper</a> CPUs (not interested) and confirmation of a long-rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a>, the Radeon RX 9060 XT (cautiously interested). It’s a true mid-ranger in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">RTX 5060 Ti</a> vein, and like its Nvidia rival, will launch with both 8GB and 16GB versions – the latter of which will cost $349, the lowest MSRP of any current-gen 16GB gaming GPU, upon its release in June.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Whether or not that pricing holds remains to be seen; AMD’s higher-end <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-prices-look-good-assuming-they-hold">RX 9070</a> GPUs have been famously difficult to find at their advertised starting price, and while the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB was supposed to launch from $379, in practice you’d be lucky to find one below $420. Although, if <em>everyone's</em> GPUs are inflated, then the cheapest one should still remain the cheapest? In theory?</p>
<p>Either way, there are other encouraging signs for the 16GB RX 9060 XT, even if its $299 8GB edition sounds like a bit of a non-starter. It’s the first of AMD’s mid-range cards, for example, to support PCIe 5.0 x16 bandwidth, meaning it will take better advantage of modern motherboard slots than previous Radeons (like the dud <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review">RX 7600</a>). Performance-wise, AMD say it’s 6% faster on average than the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p, though in a bit of graphs-bodging that Nvidia themselves would be proud of... that’s only the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti. Presumably the 16GB model puts up a better fight.</p>
<p>You do get the same FSR 4 upscaling compatibility as the RX 9070 family, though, so Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> advantage might not weigh so heavily. The RX 9060 XT also happens to be launching into what feels like a period of all-time-low goodwill towards the green team, who are currently mired in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/only-press-who-previewed-the-rtx-5060-under-nvidias-test-conditions-are-getting-review-drivers-reports-claim">accusations of giving preferential access to friendly media</a> and attempting to leverage undue pressure on independent review processes.</p>
<p>That won’t make the RX 9060 XT a better graphics card, obviously. But more VRAM, upgraded PCIe tech, and a lower price just might. We’ll find out next month, and I’ll update this story with UK pricing if I can get it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
