            <p>If you can't resist taking cheeky potshots at your fellow players in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the shooter's matchmaking can now neatly shuffle you into a session where you're more likely to get a taste of your own medicine. Developers Embark have confirmed that some "aggression-based matchmaking" has been sprinkled into the game's systems as of late, making PvP-prone players a bit more likely to be funnelled towards each other.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Said confirmation comes directly from the mouth of Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">Games Beat</a>. "Obviously first it's skill based, of course," the exec said of how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> handles shifting folks where they need to go to start a game. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. Also since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on...how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE and have less conflict with players, you'll get matched up [in line] with that [more often]. Obviously, it's not a full science," Söderlund added, before agreeing that it'd be accurate to dub this aggression-based matchmaking.</p>
<p>While the exec was clear this new element is just part of the equation the game turns to when deciding where to shuffle which players, it'll be intriguing to see how folks' willingness to turn their guns on each other being taken into account shapes things going forwards. Söderlund didn't shed any light on how exactly the game measures your PvPness and the exact weight it's given in where you get funnelled - possibly because he was busy playing Arc Raiders as he gave this interview.</p><p>From what he did say, though, it sounds like something simply designed to gently nudge different players towards an experience which mirrors how they play. Whether that's as desirable as filtering by skill level or to shift away folks who show annoying habits like griefing or regularly dropping out of matches at awkward times - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> springs to mind in terms of the latter - is the question.</p>
<p>In the short-term, running into less folks gunning for your head might be ideal if you're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-is-a-good-shooter-but-its-also-where-i-go-for-a-walk-and-relax">keen to keep things a bit more chill</a>. However, in the long run, maybe it'll dull down some of the unpredictability which helps keep any online game - but especially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> - feeling fresh. We'll see how things play out.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> voice actor Ned Luke - aka Michael de Santa - got swatted for the eighth time over Xmas. I don’t mean that somebody belted him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper. I mean that somebody put in a hoax call to emergency services in a bid to have armed police sent to his house. The latest incident happened this December while Luke was streaming GTA Online with Rob Wiethoff, the voice of John Marston in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. YouTuber IceBladeNinja has the whole clip for you to watch below.</p><!--more-->

<p>“Swatting” is, obviously, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/first-ever-uk-swatting-sentence-passed-after-man-shot-in-face-by-armed-unit-due-to-hoax-call-13118559">very dangerous</a> in a country like the USA, where there are more guns than humans and the police are especially well-armed. It has gotten <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/ohio-gamer-pleads-guilty-swatting-caused-death">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-man-targeted-his-twitter-handle-dies-after-swatting-call-n1274747">of people</a> killed, that I know about.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the cops seem pretty relaxed in the footage, possibly because they’re aware that Luke is a frequent target of such malevolent pranking - indeed, one of them can be heard saying "you've been swatted again". If it were me, I’d be lying on the floor nonetheless with all limbs extended at 45 degree angles, but Luke just gets up with a sigh and says hello to the fuzz, then goes back to playing GTA Online for an hour and a half. I guess it’s just as well he didn’t answer the door in character for Michael.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Kotaku</a>, Luke says he was repeatedly swatted in late 2023, after his address was leaked online, and that at one point, the police ordered him to step outside his house. He's also initiated legal proceedings against some of the swatters, with one person due <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2004926105275498972">to appear in court for sentencing</a> this month - we'll keep an eye out for that, I guess. It’s not clear there’s any real motivation for Luke's repeated swatting, beyond random people being spiteful.</p>
<p>This feels like the kind of morbid present-day cultural phenomena the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> should parody, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6s-wholesome-boris-bike-docking-revealed-in-alleged-wip-rockstar-portfolio-video">Boris Bikes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-appears-to-have-its-own-florida-man-parody">Florida Man</a>, but then again, that would only be encouraging the arseholes.
