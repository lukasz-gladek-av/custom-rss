            <p>It is I, the guy who has only played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> playing his second autobattler, and getting strong Mechabellum vibes from it. Except, actually no, not at all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/he-is-coming">He Is Coming</a>, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.</p>
<p>Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.</p>

<p>The first thing I get is a sword named 'heartdrinker', which restores one health on a hit. Am I invincible already? Have I won?<em> Then</em> I find an anvil that gives me a 'deal two thorns and take one damage' upgrade to my sword. Will this pair up nicely with my health regen? It absolutely does not. I'm getting battered. The next wolf I fight eats my feet and I die miserably. The game doesn't say "a wolf eats your feet" or anything, but that's what I imagine happened. Wolf's gotta eat.</p><p>But what's this! Meta progression between runs! Equipment I unlock by meeting certain criteria, the first of which is simply dying? This, I like. Meta progression in roguelikes is universally good and I'll hear no argument to the contrary (I am actually interested in hearing argument to the contrary).</p>
<p>I trundle around for a bit. Quite a lot of the joy early on is just discovering what all the event nodes do, so I hope this extends long past <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824490/He_is_Coming/">the Steam demo</a>. You might find a font of oil that buffs your sword, or a fairy than can transform equipment. You might just find hedgehogs. I keep killing hedgehogs in a single hit and feeling nothing. Am I broken? My icon shows a knight but I start with a stick? Is this a Don Quixote simulator? How would Don Quixote feel about killing hedgehogs? So many questions. Let's look at Steam for answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long-forgotten enemy rises and brings portents of doom – the Demon King is coming, and without a champion to strike him down, the world will surely fall to his corruption. Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that settles it: it's a Sokoban, and it's out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I don't play many visual novels, but I've played enough to know that Of The Devil is hot. Hot like the sizzle of rain through a neon signboard as a dull-eyed redhead walks into a cyberpunk police station at 3am and starts throwing around Chandlerisms like she's boiling an egg - <em>and you're the egg</em>. "Information's like cash in my line of work," says the dame, who is a freelance lawyer called Morgan. "You've got to spend it to make it." She sizes up the holographic front desk, with its sprinkling of things to OBSERVE. "Let's see if I can't poke around and shake some change loose."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If you hate purpulp detective fiction you may have already clicked away, in which case: up yours, Jerky McJerkface, I never liked you anyway. If you're still here, you may be relieved to learn that Of The Devil is capable of taking the piss out of itself, though this is far from parody. For example, one of the first objects you can OBSERVE is a datapad containing a corporate press release which Morgan - whose opening narration muses upon a "slight blunting of the night's ambience, emphasis on the slight" - dismisses as "flowery". One of the first things you can have her do is forget her own date of birth.

<p>
The more indulgent noir flourishes also dissipate as you push on with Morgan's task, which is to defend a guy who has seemingly been caught bang to rights for murdering his girlfriend. You interview a couple of classically mismatched detectives - a lanky whimsical oldster and a snarling young gun with an eyepatch. You use your phone's AR functionality to comb a hot pink projection of the crime scene. The near-future setting takes shape in a glittery wash of allusions to experimental androids and surveillance and unjust laws. The dialogue becomes almost steely.</p><p>As you talk and probe and deduce, filling out your phone's casefiles, you earn casino chips which you'll eventually play in interrogation sequences that resemble high-octane collectible card games. Yes, that line about information being a currency was a tutorial, actually.
</p>
<p>
Even when the writing is laying it on thick, Of The Devil gets away with it because the visuals and audio are a blast. The presentation recalls <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>: fixed-perspective 3D environments, 2D character art and a very dishy interface, with a music player pulsing away in top right. The characters are rakish, crazy-eyed confections with an efficient spread of expressions and changes of posture. While there's no voice-acting, they each get their own pitch of digital typewriter noise during dialogue, which is one of those well-worn, conceptually simple tricks that never fails to delight me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/">Find Of The Devil on Steam</a>. I played the first free prologue chapter this morning for an hour and it really feels like a goer - as cool as the moon reflecting from an android's bum through the smoke from a cigarette kindled on the wrong side of a one-way-street.</p>
<p>It's a pay-per-episode format, with one paid episode available so far. To repeat a cry oftenheard around these parts of late, I don't know if we have the resources to review it, but I intend to play more. Thanks very much to freelance scribe Autumn Wright for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lhpsptjcic2o">spotting the game and boosting it on Bluesky</a>.

<p>"Hey Steam community," goes the delightfully unadorned <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/">Steam page</a> introduction to this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation game</a>. "I'm Ben, and I created this game in my spare time!". I love you, Ben. Not a "play your way" in sight. Nary a "the only limit is your imagination". Absent a venomous and detestable "easy to learn, hard to master". Just a bloke named Ben, and a hole named hole.</p>

<p>"Dig deep, sell what you find, update your equipment to continue your journey further and further. With every spadeful you dig, you get closer to the truth. There's no rush, no rules - just you and the adventure underground," Ben continues. "Costs as much as a coffee, but is fun for longer and is caffeine-free!"</p><p>That last point is debatable, but I'll let it slide. Also the game costs £4/$5. Cheap game, but if someone tried to charge me that much for coffee I'd be so mad I'd have to actually leave my house and find out how much people charge for coffee these days. Actually, no. No. Sorry. Going to stay in. Got a hole to dig, innit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
