            <p>The word choom gets on my nerves a bit, to be honest. Probably because it feels like it's said every five minutes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which might persuade me to reverse my stance, though. It's called Gonkle and allows the game to serve you daily Wordle-style puzzles which might improve your Cyberpunk vocabulary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"GONKLE brings daily word puzzles to Night City," modder MisterChedda wrote of their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/24847?tab=description">latest creation</a>, which you can find in the dairy aisle of Nexus Mods. "Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone - same word for everyone, so you can compare results with others." Yep, Wordle, but for Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>As such, the modder's made sure the terms you'll have to guess if you sign up to the in-game text service which delivers these little puzzle boxes to you daily are suitably Cyberpunk, having thumbed through the game's sourcebooks to add a bunch of universe-specific lingo to a manually-collated eligible word list. That means <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Streetslang">streetslang</a> and jargon like chromed, eddies, ripperdoc, and of course choom can pop up as the thing you've got to guess. Gonkle'll automatically track your correct solve streak and progress auto-saves, meaning each daily puzzle will be ticked off as done across all of your saves when you complete it in just one of them.</p>

<p>To get a bit more in-depth as to how the mod works, its application programming interface-based innards sound similar to one MisterChedda previously set up to serve <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20381?tab=description">daily cat facts</a> in Cyberpunk. "The mod makes a single API call to fetch today's puzzle (the word, date, etc), but it doesn't send any personal data back. There's no tracking or telemetry. Your guesses, stats, and progress are saved locally on your machine," MisterChedda outlined.</p><p>"One GET request is sent to a <a href="https://misterchedda.com/api/wordle">custom API endpoint</a> I made for this mod when you open the game," they continued. "This retrieves information about today's puzzle. Nothing about you, your game, or your V leaves your computer. The mod uses an open source http client called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14192">RedHttpClient</a>' to execute this, so anyone can verify the source code. The API endpoint is also open source."</p>
<p>As well as RedHttpClient, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14139">RedData</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13378">RedFileSystem</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a> are all requirements to get Gonkle up and running.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the puzzles are something that'd stay a priority in any Cyberpunk playthrough of mine once the initial novelty wears off. If nothing else they're an optional roleplaying aid for folks who go all-in on netrunning, but quickly realise the cyborg boffin they've created is far too cool to be accepted into the wider deckhead community. Deckhead, of course, being a bit of cyberslang I've accidentally ended up reminding myself of while writing about embiggening cybervocabularies. Also, an alternative netrunner term for the real world is apparently to dub it 'the meatspace', which somehow feels less appropriate to deploy in serious situations than choom.</p>

            <p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this year, a group of former ZeniMax developers have formed a worker-owned studio dubbed Sackbird. Made up of folks who worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">cancelled MMO codenamed Blackbird</a>, the studio have confirmed they're working on an unnamed original game that'll hit PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Zenimax's Blackbird project was one of numerous games cancelled as Microsoft laid of around 9,000 staff in July, with the ZeniMax Online Studios United union left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">fighting for the jobs of members affected</a>. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">subsequently reported</a> that Blackbird was a sci-fi noir-ish third-person shooter with looty bits and lots of vertical movement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to the <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight">formation of Sackbird Studios</a>, who've already won this year's award for most wonderfully tongue-in-cheek branding. The "independent, employee-owned game studio that is self-funded for multiple years" have adopted a roaming avian armed with a sack of belongings as their logo, and have <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/home">a website</a> which invites folks to "seek the sack" or "drop a sack" as a means of getting in touch.</p>
<p>Given how badly beaten most folks in and around the games industry are with the layoff truncheon at this point, it's lovely to see Sackbird having fun with what's happened. They're also very up front about using it to inform their new approach to game-making. "After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets," Sackbird COO David Worley, an ex-ZeniMax principal tools engineer, said. "We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games."</p><p>"We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people," Sackbird's CEO Lee Ridout, a long-time director of ecommerce for The Elder Scrolls Online, added. "When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable."</p>
<p>Sackbird are currently made up of a "tight, senior team" of fewer than ten devs, and have confirmed that they're actively developing a currently unannounced "original project for PC and consoles". They plan to share more info about this first game when they're ready.</p>
