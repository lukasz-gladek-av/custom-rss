Everything is expensive. Everything! Bills, food, video games, you name it. I mean, £75 for a game where you drive around as an Italian plumber? Not entirely convinced by this one, Mr. Bowser. I could get into the weeds of why all of this is happening (none of it for being particularly good reasons), but I won't because I bring word of something actually getting less expensive. Shock horror, I know, and yet here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockfish-games">Rockfish Games</a> announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everspace-2">Everspace 2's</a> upcoming Wrath of the Ancients DLC will be a bit cheaper when it launches.
</p>
<p>
Rockfish shared the news in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614">Steam post earlier this week</a>, explaining that "with events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general." Said events could perhaps be in reference to a certain man in a certain position of power enacting baffling tariffs, though I could be reading a smidge too deep between the lines here. As such, while the initial plan was for Wrath of the Ancients to be priced at $30, it'll now only be $25, quite a nice little reduction.
</p>
<p>
In turn, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game's</a> previous bit of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everspace-2-turns-monster-hunter-with-secret-nebula-dwelling-kaiju-that-are-essentially-living-procgen-dungeons">Titans</a> is also being lowered from $15 to $12. Great! Rockfish also quite quickly cleared up that no, "no content has been cut," and that currently they're in the "middle of our final polish and bug fixing phase ahead of release."
</p>
<p>
I am genuinely not sure I've heard of a developer lowering the cost of DLC prior to it even releasing like this before. I'm sure it must have happened somewhere along the line, but couldn't possibly tell you when. It's genuinely just quite a nice move because $5 really can go a long way. You'll be able to pick it up pretty soon too, as it launches on May 12th next month.

I always find it a bit odd when people make comparisons like "new game is the next game you really love" because you're most likely setting yourself up for some kind of disappointment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> was the most recent game to fall victim to such a framing, with many dubbing it as British <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a>, which it didn't end up being, nor was it likely intended to be. Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of "yeah, it's not bad", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion's</a> mind.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, and how he's feeling post launch. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall," Kingsley explained, continuing on to say, "Happily, that risk is paying off." Guess that roughly positive, slightly mixed response isn't a huge deal then! That doesn't mean Kingsley believes the scale of the developer's projects is perfect, in fact when asked about it whether or not they've got it just right, he said he doesn't think so.
</p>
<p>
"I think that one of the things Chris [Kingsley, Rebellion co-founder and CTO] and I want to do is repeat success. So we want to do more Sniper Elite, we want to do more Zombie Army, we want to do more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-brigade">Strange Brigade</a>. Now it looks like we want to do more Atomfall - it's been successful, can we find the resources to do it? I don't know."
</p>
<p>
Kingsley goes on to talk about things like those Fallout comparisons, success on Game Pass, releasing Sniper Elite: Resistance just a couple of months beforehand, all well worth reading, but no clear indication as to whether or not he thinks a sequel might come. Rebellion are obviously best known for their Sniper series these days, which continue to do well. Perhaps we'll have to wait a while longer to see if they can carve out a slice of that pie for another Atomfall.

Look, here's the thing. I'm no narc, but when it comes to online games, you probably shouldn't cheat. Do what you want in single-player games! But in the multiplayer space you're there to have a nice time with everybody, you know? And as it turns out in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, things can end pretty badly for you (I promise this isn't a Mafia-style threat). The official Monster Hunter Twitter account shared a post yesterday announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> have "confirmed the unauthorized modification of game data in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post comes with a pretty scary sounding warning too: "Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game unplayable. If you suspect a quest has been modified, please do not play it, or stop playing it immediately." Capcom even provided a handy chart of different criteria, like target monsters, which you'll only ever find one to two of in a quest, and the modified version, which can have three or more. As Capcom warns, if you see something like that, avoid starting the quest.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🔍Expanded Countermeasures Against Unauthorized Data Modification🔍</p><p>We plan to implement additional countermeasures in future updates to detect users who have engaged in unauthorized modification of game data to prevent other players from being implicated in such actions.</p><p>We…</p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1913217339102835099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
In a follow-up post, the developer noted it plans to add "additional countermeasures" to find people that are modifying quests like these, which will come in future updates. What these countermeasures are, we'll have to wait and see, but right now Capcom are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534347841813873218?l=english">examining the final ranking results</a> for the recent Doshaguma of the Hollow challenge quest for the next one to two weeks to root out cheaters. If that includes you, you'll likely see your account receive some restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I don't really understand why you'd bother cheating in a game like Monster Hunter where the challenge is the point. Your ranking is meaningless if you didn't achieve it yourself, buddy! Maybe go play a PS2 game and put on big-head mode or something if you've got the need to cheat.

It's Star Wars Celebration right now, which as I gather is about celebrating giant balls of gas fighting one another. Sorry, I'm being told that it's actually about some multimedia franchise that has so much going on it's impossible to keep track of? Doesn't sound right to me, but I'll have to trust it. Arguably the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Warsy game</a> announcement of the weekend is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-zero-company-looks-like-xcom-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-in-its-first-trailer">first trailer for the Star Wars meets XCOM game Star Wars Zero Company</a>, but it wasn't the only one. Turns out last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' second story pack got a reveal too, and a release date to boot.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one's pirate themed, as evidenced by the DLC's name, A Pirate's Fortune, once again following Kay and Nix on a new adventure in the Khepi system. As is often the case with Star Wars media that isn't the movies, A Pirate's Fortune features one of those Glup Shitto type characters, Hondo Ohnaka, who you'll be joining forces with for this particular escapade. He originally appeared in the animated Clone Wars series, first season even, so even if I jest a touch, he really has been around for a while now.

<p>
You'll also be facing off against a new character called Stinger Tash, both of you looking to enter some place called the Khepi Tomb to "uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds." The DLC also adds in the Miyuki Trade League which can net you goodies for your ship, the Trailblazer, and even if you aren't getting A Pirate's Fortune, everyone will also receive some cosmetics inspired by Star Wars: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeleton-crew">Skeleton Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The DLC's out quite soon too, currently due to arrive May 15, less than a month away. I wouldn't bet on any more story stuff after this though, so savour it while you can.

            <p>
We've all known it's coming for a long while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-are-making-three-new-star-wars-games-including-a-new-strategy-game-with-former-xcom-devs">three years in fact</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> got a proper reveal today. In case you aren't sure which one this was meant to be, it's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> one from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bit-reactor">Bit Reactor</a>, led by former XCOM devs. For the most part the announcement trailer is just a CGI cutscene, you've been round this rodeo before, you know how these things go. Though, it does end with a smidge of gameplay and yeah, it really does just look like Star Wars by way of XCOM, which is likely to be an instant winner.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I'm not exactly sure if "gritty" and "authentic" are words that'd normally apply to any Star Wars media - let's not forget Yoda was literally performed and played by The Muppets' own Fozzie Bear - but that's how Star Wars Zero Command has been described, at the very least. The single-player game is set "during the twilight of the Clone Wars" where you'll play as Hawks, a "former Republic officer" who leads the titular Zero Company.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
They're a band of misfits, by the sounds of things, and they've been recruited by Hawks that sees them facing off against some vague threat that could consume the galaxy, or whatever. This is Star Wars, there's always galaxy threatening stuff going on, and this is a prequel so we can only assume things will generally end well - though, in a press release CEO and creative director of Bit Reactor Greg Foertsch did say in a statement that they're aiming to provide "meaningful outcomes" based on the choices you make.
</p>
<p>
The core gameplay looks mighty similar to XCOM, and apparently between missions you'll be able to build up your own base and do spy things like gathering intelligence. On top of that you'll be able to make and customise your own squad of "authored Star Wars characters", so it sounds like you shouldn't expect Jar Jar Binks to show up.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps predictably, an exact release date hasn't been confirmed just yet, but it is supposedly releasing sometime in 2026, and it'll be available on PC via Steam.
