            <p>The Saudi-led acquisition of Electronic Arts is meeting with more friction in the US House of Congress. 46 lawmakers have signed a letter calling on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the debt-financed $55 billion deal for signs that it could be damaging for workers and anti-competitive to the point of breaking US anti-trust law.</p>
<p>As passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/congress-members-voice-serious-concern-over-saudi-led-ea-buyout">Game Developer</a>, the letter has been organised by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross – the Labor Caucus being a group of over 120 members of Congress focused on "advancing the needs of working people and the labor movement” in the USA. </p>
<p>Sent 22 January, the letter suggests that the acquisition could lead to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, the offshoring of development, and studio closures. Which doesn't feel like a massive reach, to me: if the deal goes through, the newly private and majority Saudi-owned EA will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">owe the banks $20 billion</a>. They definitely aren’t going to balance the books by delegating all their PowerPoint presentations to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,” the lawmakers – all of them Democrats – write. </p><p>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs,” the letter continues. “EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.” </p>
<p>The lawmakers note that EA has experienced “a steep decline in median worker pay year-over-year” and has “eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023”, which they consider indicative of “a labor market where workers already have fewer alternatives and employers can impose deteriorating conditions without consequence.” They consider the aforesaid $20 billion debt package a strong incentive “for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closure.”</p>
<p>The Labor Caucus co-chairs further argue that the acquisition could be both terrible for workers and anti-competitive, in that the proposed buyers – that’s Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Saudi-backed Affinity Partners - “hold extensive ownership stakes across sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools”. </p>
<p>“For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses,” the lawmakers write. They’re concerned that if the deal goes through – and given that Kushner is married to the President's daughter, it’s unlikely to have much trouble - the purchasing consortium and EA would control enough of the sports sector to “restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry”. They also think it could violate anti-trust laws.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">Unveiled in September last year</a>, the EA deal has already attracted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">strong criticism from American unions and senators</a>. The unions argue, amongst other things, that EA is “not a struggling company” right now, making hundreds of millions in profit. As such, they think plunging the company into debt is an exercise in padding investor pockets at the expense of worker livelihoods. Can’t really disagree!</p>
<p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, are worried that selling EA to Saudi Arabia is a national security risk, commenting that the country might use EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda. As ever, I can see the logic of this, but it’s worth noting that EA among other North American companies routinely publish games that are very flattering to the US military, and that US companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-microsoft-idUSBRE96A11R20130711/">have participated in government surveillance operations</a>.</p>
<p>A broader concern is that Saudi Arabia are buying up overseas brands, including a number of eSports organisations, to distract attention from their <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">terrible human rights record</a>. There's also anxiety that the country’s authoritarian rulers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">might impose their values on EA games like The Sims</a> that embrace diversity. One former BioWare executive has suggested that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> studio are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">particularly at risk of either co-option or closure</a>.</p>

            <p>Ah, cool. The world's foremost hosts of unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> additions you'd rather not have to explain to an elderly relative, Nexus Mods, have committed to bringing SteamOS support to their mod manager Vortex at some point down the line. That'll mean you can use it with the Steam Machine and Steam Deck, if you fancy a modded playthrough on the go or via a smaller package.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-killing-its-multiplatform-mod-manager-nexus-revives-its-spirit-with-an-announcement-that-its-windows-only-app-will-support-steamos-in-future/">Parliament Candidate Gamer</a>, the modding site have slipped this confirmation into a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15433">post</a> about their focuses for this year. Upon opting to stop developing the multiplatform Nexus Mods App <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-latest-modathon-isnt-a-typical-modathon-its-a-first-go-at-the-same-for-multi-mod-collections">earlier this month</a>, the Nexus folks hadn't ruled out potentially working the Linux support that was planned to include into what's now their one and only mod manager - the Windows-only Vortex.</p>
<p>Now, they've announced that they're committed to delivering Steam OS support to Vortex at some point in the future. "We’ll be targeting vanilla Steam hardware like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine," product manager Iluviel wrote. "We won’t be officially supporting any other configurations, but as Vortex is an open source project community developers will be free to extend support for their preferred Linux distros as they please."</p>
<p>I can only imagine how chuffed our dedicated treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-steam-deck-performance-settings">Deck</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">enthusiast</a> James is about the idea of possibly having to have even more conversations with me on a weekly basis as a result of this. I can see his stoic expression now, as I gently poke him and declare: "That Thomas dragons mod for Skyrim runs great, you should analyse exactly how many frames per train carriage it's averaging". I can see his eyes rolling as I arrive at morning meetings wondering aloud whether I should shove a Steam Machine into a fairly titchy space just to get 40 minutes into a modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> playthrough for the millionth time before giving up.</p>
<p>Actually, I can see him aiming his liquid-cooled 4090 blunderbuss at me from across the virtual office as we speak. Hey man, what it it that you w-</p>
<p>Well, that was unpleasant, but I've dusted myself off so I can relay the other stuff Nexus Mods said about their future plans for Vortex here. "Our plans for the year include a steady, iterative modernisation of the Vortex user experience," they wrote. "We’ll be investing in the developer experience, which will allow us to focus on quality-of-life improvements, specifically streamlining navigation, simplifying game management, and introducing more intuitive controls for load orders. You can expect the interface to become cleaner and more responsive as we integrate the design lessons learned from our recent projects."</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to pick large metal balls out of my face.</p>

            <p>After having the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> bit of their R.E.A.L VR mod/framework <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">taken down via a DMCA from CD Projekt</a>, modder Luke Ross claims to have had another stike filed against their work. This time, the strike has come from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> publishers 505 Games, according to a post from Ross in which they say they've been "forced to temporarily pause" their Patreon page.</p>
<p>While Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-modder-doesnt-rule-out-releasing-it-for-free-after-dmca-claims-there-was-no-negotiation-with-cd-projekt">being behind a paywall</a> was at the centre of CD Projekt's decision to file a takedown, there appears to have been no indication so far as to whether the same is true of the alleged strike from 505.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/realvr/about?">'About' section of the modder's Patreon page</a> now hosts the following message:</p>
<blockquote>Beware! Due to DMCA notices received from CD PROJEKT S.A. (see https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771) and 505 Games, I am forced to temporarily pause the Patreon page. You can still subscribe if you want to support me, but be advised that for the moment there will be no benefits available. No access to the 40+ mods or detailed information about my VR conversions, until the legal situation clears out. Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments.</blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">alleged email</a> from Ross to their subscibers expanding on the situation has been posted to r/virtualreality, as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>"Fast forward to today, and another publisher just sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon: namely 505 Games, for my VR conversion of Ghostrunner," the email reads, following a recap of the Cyberpunk situation. "No mention of any terms of service violation this time. Again Patreon automatically complied. I don't blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they "believe" their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>
<p>I've reached out to 505 Games for comment.</p>
<p>As a result of this alleged second strike, Ross wrote in the email that they've opted to make "all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years" unavailable, citing the need to avoid incurring any more DMCA strikes in the near future.</p><p>Since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time," the modder added. "You don't need to unsubscribe: I paused the billing cycle for one month so that your pledges will NOT be renewed automatically, and those of you who are already subscribed will have their access extended for one month without further payments. I hope one month will be enough for the fog to clear up, and to understand what is going to happen to our collective attempt to make VR available for AAA games."</p>
