            <p>Where were you on October 11th last year? If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">announcement of a project</a> from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Before that</a> came sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>, and before <em>that</em> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG"</a> from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/">here</a>, should you wish. Here's the sell:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of Disco Elysium with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of Planescape: Torment, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contributors to the project include Piotr Sobolewsk, who worked on Disco Elysium's system design as part of support studio <a href="https://theknightsofu.com/projects/disco-elysium/">Knights Of Unity</a>. Longdue promise "more extraordinary talent set to be unveiled as part of the crowdfunding launch," having previously teased the contributions of mystery alumni from Bungie, Rockstar, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yes-your-grace">Yes, Your Grace</a>’s Brave At Night.</p><p>You'll be playing as a rogue journalist: "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel". Well, I <em>do</em> love to be told how I see humanity before making a single dialogue choice. "Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels."</p>
<p>So, how does old Funter S. Tedious here stand out from H.D.B? Here's a bit more on that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a word for being interested but unenthusiastic at the same time? I should probably know one, but I'm afraid I'm simply too much of a cynical unhinged rogue gonzo bruise-poking provocateur to work on my vocabulary.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">little primer</a> if you're looking to get up to speed on the messy events that transpired in the fallout of Disco Elysium's release. It's got everything: People being dicks to each other. People being cosmic megadicks to each other. People being ensorceled turbodicks to each other. The works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>'s Adventure mode - a procedurally generated campaign that lets you approach the famously dense colony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> like a more traditional roguelite - is now out as a free update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">on Steam</a>. The game represents perhaps the most cavernous, yawping blind spot in my entire pile of shame. I do own it, but I'm yet to play. I've already read a great deal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-basement-of-curiosity">extended wordery</a> on its merits - please, sell it to me in the comments in seven words or less. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>Graham most definitely has played it though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortress-the-detailed-roguelike-thats-easy-to-play">calling</a> its older incarnation "a good way to experience the charms of its procedural world and high level of simulation". Personal anecdotes and experience are great and all, but what I really want is some deeply impersonal bullet-pointed features from a store page. Here are Adventure Mode's:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Go anywhere! Explore any civilization, earn a reputation, and recruit followers to join you</li>
<li>Experience your fortress and the simulation in a new, more embodied way</li>
<li>Explore mythical dungeons to find magical items, artifacts, and fill your quest journal</li>
<li>Hints of mythology and magic as a start of future simulation enrichment to come</li>
<li>An additional hour of music from Dabu and Simon Swerwer, presented as a second volume of the original soundtrack</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>As Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortresss-adventure-mode-getting-tutorials-and-more-direction-in-the-sandbox">covered here</a>, Adventure Mode sounds tailored for aspirant beardlings such as a myself, with a focus on tutorialisation and a more personal feel, since you only play a single character. Here's some further insight from co-creators Tarn and Zach Adams</p>
<blockquote><p>“In our earliest conception of the game you were meant to lose...  lose for a reason! Even before your fortresses existed in a huge procedurally generated world, they were destroyed and became haunted ruins you could explore in an RPG-style adventure. Years later, as our fantasy worlds have grown and become more complex, the Adventure Mode experience is so much more impressive.  Now the entire world is connected in ways you can actually see.  Visit the far off lands that send caravans to your fortresses, or seek out and slay the monsters that have troubled your dwarves before.  The extensive combat system only viewed from afar in Fortress Mode is now yours to use to inflict violence on your enemies...  or if you choose, travel the world and recite poetry to a room full of wombat men."</p></blockquote>
<p>W…wombat men, you say?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
