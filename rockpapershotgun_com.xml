            <p>Time to phone Genghis Khan. Tell him the news. There's gonna be a bit more waiting before you can become 13th century Mongolia's a truest Yam courier rider/horse befriender. Following its latest Steam Next Fest demo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">The Legend of Khiimori</a>'s early access release has been pushed back to March next year.</p>
<p>I know, throw down your spurs like they're Yosemite Sam's hat. There's neigh way developers Aesir Interactive and NightinGames have done this to you. Well, they have, but they say they've got the game's best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The equine delivery sim's now set to emerge from early access on March 3rd, 2026, its developers have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2697000/view/519727718097487890?l=english">announced</a>. "The wonderful reception during Steam Next Fest has led to us sitting down with our publisher and together we have decided to take more time to create a more feature and content-rich experience," they wrote. "While this does mean that you all have to wait a little longer to get your hands on Khiimori, it also means weâ€™ll be able to make sure you get a better game when we do release into Early Access."</p><p>Alongside fleshing Khiimori out with extra features, Aesir say their "main priorities" include improving "player guidance and world experience", as well as the camera, controls, and interface. They also plan to make some performance tweaks to help the game run a bit more smoothly and lower its fairly lofty minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>To help tide the bronco busters of the Steam corral over, the game's Next Fest demo has stuck around past the conclusion of the great demopocalypse and won't disappear until November 30th. So, if like me you've not had a chance to give it a go yet, there's an extra month or so to find a saddle.</p>
<p>I am keen to try it, though, despite not being a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> enjoyer. There's something in its description of breeding and caring for a steed as you negotiate delivery routes you've plotted out, occasionally stopping to forage or shoot a thing with your bow, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s wilderness-wandering. Or, like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> with mares instead of Mack lorries.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find The Legend of Khiimori's lingering demo if you gallop over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697000/The_Legend_of_Khiimori/">Steam page</a>.</p>
