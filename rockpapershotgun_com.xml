            <p><a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/index.html">Snakists</a> is a game by Pippin Barr, author of many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pippin-barr">small and wonderful ludic experiments</a>. The most pertinent of which, in this case, is <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/">Snakisms</a>. That one takes the can-I-borrow-your-Nokia-for-a-minute-mate 'em up and explores a smattering of experimental design tunnels based on different schools of thoughts. 'Pessimism', for example, forces you to contend with a prized gobblin' dot placed permanently outside the confines of your snakely entrapment box, 'Asceticism' kills you as soon as you eat a dot, and so on.</p>
<p>Snakists takes this concept and applies it to concepts ending with 'ist'. Deist, purist, sadist, and so on, for a total of 20 different tail-wriggling tales. I enjoy them for how they both celebrate Snake and also employ its relative simplicity as a neutral palette on which to mix colourful synthesis of languages both human and game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For example, 'alarmist' is funny to play because it shouts at you whenever you get even mildly close to a wall. But it also stands as a sharply apt metaphor for the self-fulfilling prophecy that is constant anxiety. The closer you get to wall, the more the screen is obscured by the word 'CAREFUL!', until you can see so little you are all but guaranteed to die. The message is clear: get out of your own way. If you spend all your time worrying about tripping over, your legs will seize up and you will eat shit post haste.</p>
<p>Another favourite here is 'tourist', which is effectively just regular snake played over an image of a nice building. I appreciate its non judgemental attitude, leaving me to consider the implications of tourism on my own time, perhaps outside a nice cafe. Perhaps I'll scout around a bit and see where and what the locals are having, or perhaps I'll get really annoyed because this coastal Spanish town can't get my fried egg and chips the way I like it, as is the English way.</p>
<p>Much to think about. Many dots to consume.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>People often get snarky about Reddit but I consider the work of user _inferno_44 to be better games journalism than anything I've written in at least a month, probably longer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvezvr/i_followed_kyle_for_a_week_heres_his_daily">Three</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvn6um/following_up_our_employee_of_the_year_heres_the">colour</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jw7rxo/by_popular_demand_i_followed_jessi_for_a_day_to">coded</a> spreadsheets blocking out three <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a> NPC's daily routines, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">ox watchin</a>' style.

<p>They're surprisingly detailed for something that's mainly there to get you to hoof around a bit. Plus fixed routines are just good world building for a weed selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> such as this. They raise pertinent questions. Does the forbidden spinach blur the ache of sharp routine like existential Alka Seltzer? Or does it encourage such contemplation as to appreciate the hidden rapture in the familiar?</p>

<p>Might we imagine Kyle pressing a soft taco shell against his cheek and feeling, for all the world, like he is being caressed by the glove of creation? His is one of the less varied routines, moving mainly between work and home save a half hour break the skatepark. Still, there's nobility in it, I think. Perhaps we've been misled. Perhaps this was the titular Schedule all this time.</p>
<p>Less industrious is Kyle's roommate, Austin, who splits his time between the community centre and the arcade. At 6:00pm each day, he leaves the arcade and furiously drinks for 45 minutes before returning. I get it, man. It's acutely embarrassing to boast to a stranger that you can "beat Time Crisis in one life" only to repeatedly get your bottom mailed to you by a cabinet tuned far harder than the PS1 version. I'd drink too. Heck, I'm drinking now just thinking about it, and also because it makes my breakfast taste better.</p>
<p>Most varied is fan fave product hound Jessi, who visits four separate locations to sit and smoke and consume canned beverages. Like all the NPCs, she walks in real time between destinations. I've been fascinated by this stuff since Oblivion blew my tiny mind when I spotted an NPC's marker move across the map to the destination I was told to meet him at. I can't say it still feels quite as magical as it did then, but it's still retained some wonder for me. Another reminder that there's more going on under the hood in Schedule I than its sudden explosion of memey popularity might suggests. And an extra reminder, for myself more than anything, that sometimes a lot of people like a thing because it's actually good, you shrivelling hipster.</p>
<p>I mean, rarely, but still.</p></div>

            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which sounds… pleasant.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.
