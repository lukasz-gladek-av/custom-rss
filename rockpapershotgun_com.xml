            <p>When I downloaded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creeper-world">Creeper World</a> IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-so-very-ed-special-creeper-world">dates back to the age of Gillen</a>. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-creeper-worlds-decade-long-evolution-keeps-getting-harder">interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019</a> - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4</a>, the first 3D instalment.</p>
<p>What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. </p><!--more-->

<p>Hopefully, we will do the aforesaid terraforming while cleverly opening passages to our mission objectives, such as power cores and hibernation pods. It's important to pare away the rock and soil deviously, even artistically - to wield the terraforming shovel like the finest of paintbrushes. But going by my 20 minutes with said demo, there's always the temptation to scrub your cursor back and forth and eradicate the layout, like a child losing patience with an Etch-A-Sketch. Up yours, fluid physics! We will find harmony in our mutual devastation. There will be no World for the Creeper to conquer.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I'm delighted by this. It makes the factional "asymmetries" of other real-time strategy games look desperately unambitious. The Zerg could learn a thing or two from the Creeper.</p>
<p>While it's labelled real-time strategy, the game often feels closer to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>, the action-RPG where you spend half the time getting melted by accidentally excavated lakes of acid. There's a similar joy in the arcane applications of particle, sand and fluid physics, with certain combinations of terrain material proving... volatile. Fingers crossed that Creeper World IXE involves teleportation, somehow.</p>
<p>Here's a feature sheet from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2257010/Creeper_World_IXE/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sand physics terrain where every pixel is simulated allowing the use of gravity and terrain as part of your strategy</p>
<p>Enhanced Creeper fluid simulation with waves creating new Creeper behaviour</p>
<p>Particle system for new and greater threats</p>
<p>Use terrain chemistry and terraforming to gain the advantage over your enemy</p>
<p>Extensive custom unit support with scripting where the community can craft their units, missions and control modules.</p>
<p>Online map database for endless fun and new challenges</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd normally end a piece like this by offering some more direct comparisons, but what can I compare Creeper World to, aside from Noita? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/from-dust">From Dust</a>? If you know of a parallel, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These prices tell us that Battlemage will, as Alchemist did, attempt to bite into the sub-$250 slice of gaming GPU market share pie that Nvidia and AMD seem content to leave uneaten. This time, however, Intel say they’re aiming for speedy 1440p play, which would suggest a huge performance upgrade over 1080p-focused Alchemist models like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-a750-review">Arc A750</a>. "Best-in-class performance-per-dollar", no less, according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-launches-arc-b-series-graphics-cards.html">marketing bumf</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the Arc B580 and Arc B570 will come packing more VRAM – 12GB and 10GB respectively – and support for XeSS 2. This is new version of Intel’s upscaler that includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>-style frame generation feature, generating inserting interpolated frames "using optical flow and motion vector reprojection". Nice? I think? With all the bells and whistles running, XeSS 2 can supposedly multiply framerate output by by 3.9x, though I’d wait to see this in action before slapping down money for a pre-order. Democratising the advantages of frame generation is a noble goal in the face of Nvidia keeping DLSS 3 support for only its latest RTX 40 series GPUs, but FSR 3 has never quite matched it on visual quality or input lag management. Thus, grudgingly, we must accept some truth in the idea that frame gen needs very specific, cutting-edge hardware to work comfortably.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m more interested in straight-up, traditionally rendered framerates, and specifically whether Intel really can pull off a proper 60fps@1440p card – or two – at such a low price. Or, as we would have said in 2016 or so, a price. The last few years have seen GPU costs rise, yet the GPU themselves sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-pc-performance-best-settings">struggling to keep up</a> with the ever-increasing demands of high fidelity games, to the extent that you can easily end up dropping £500/$500 or more to get a truly capable Quad HD engine. We probably can’t expect the Arc B580 to knock the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">RTX 4070 Super</a> off its premium perch, but given the dearth of compelling options in the lower budget ranges, I’m certainly willing to watch it take a shot.</p>
<p>In other graphics card news, Nvidia are widely expected to reveal the GeForce RTX 5090 at Las Vegas’ CES show in early January. It will probably cost more than $219. Just a bit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
