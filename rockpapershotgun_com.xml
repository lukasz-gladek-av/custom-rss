            <p>
Dear Hideo Kojima, you'd better give us a proper update on your new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-creator-hideo-kojima-is-working-on-a-brand-new-action-espionage-game-that-is-also-a-movie">action-espionage game-movie</a> wotsit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> soon, because for every hour that passes, I think of another unbearable title pun. </p>
<p>I'm not very Physinterested in Physint right now, a game defined by what it Physisn't. Perhaps I'd be more Physinto it if Kojima Productions would share a proper outline and explore the Physintricacies. But this is Hideo Kojima, a man of *grunts, strains* Sphysint-like enigma. Still, at least we now know that Don Lee from Train To Busan is in the stealthy film-o-game, together with Charlee Fraser from Furiosa and Minami Hamabe from Godzilla Minus One.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a livestream last night, Kojima discussed working with 3Lateral to model each performer's face. He shared some early renders of Hamabe in-engine. Yep, sure looks like a face.

<p>
He also shared some concept art from Physint, which certainly underlines the Metal Gear connections. There is a man in a flapping coat with a high collar. Or half a flapping coat, anyway. I can't work out where the coat ends and his utility belt ends. He's got a lot of weird harness wrapped around his right shoulder. Doubtless, this is Tactical.

Also, a rifle with a scope and a stock and a silencer. We can expect a mix of sneaky and open firefights, I expect. Behind the man there are tall forbidding buildings with a lonely bird visible against slate clouds. Hang on, the lonely bird is just a stray coffee grain on my laptop screen. Let me wipe it away. Ah, now I feel sad about the missing bird.
</p>
<p>
Is this sadness the Feeling referred to by the caption "Here Comes the Feeling"? Probably not. When will the Feeling actually arrive? In at least "another five or six years", Kojima <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet">commented in May</a>.</p>
<p>Physint is at least actually "in development", now, following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> on console. Kojima decided to make a new game in the vein of Metal Gear following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-metal-gear-fans-after-illness-in-2020">recent illness</a>. Here's hoping the next trailer or livestream at least features more legible Tactical apparel. Physint, reveal thyself!
