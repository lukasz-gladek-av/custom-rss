            <p>Vroom. Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom vroom. Ahem, sorry, dunno what happened to me there. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> EVO, the three-letter-yelling follow up to one on Steam's long-reigning top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">racing sims</a>, has just gotten its third early access update. It adds in online multiplayer, plus a bunch of fresh cars and tracks to hop into moments before you're unceremoniously punted off by a random.</p>
<p>I've been playing a bit of a waiting game with AC EVO since <a href="https://www.vg247.com/assetto-corsa-evo-feels-like-worthy-heir-to-steam-racing-titans-so-far-but-lot-of-laps-to-go">yapping about it at length for my old home</a> when it first debuted in early access at the start of this year, but this might be the point I hop behind its wheel agaion and see how devs Kunos Simulazioni have managed to flesh it out so far. After all, they've now added in a 90s Merc 190E, which is pretty much square German saloon kryptonite for my will to hold off on checking things out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Booting the gas to commence my rundown of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3058630/view/543369627969782128?l=english">update 3's inclusions</a>, the headliner's AC EVO's first step into multiplayer via a new mode that lets you hop into races against up to 16 other players who'll no doubt be polite enough not to use your rear bumper as their brake. These races are held in free in-game servers, which run 24/7 and will have the sort of variety of race scenarios, tracks, and weather settings you'd expect to pick between.</p>
<p>A portal for custom servers is said to be coming soon and those are paid, something that hasn't gone down well with players to the extent it looks to be a key factor in the EVO's Steam reviews currently sitting at mixed. In terms of what they cost, a 20 or more slot server that's live 24/7 for 30 days will be €15 plus VAT, while renting a server with unlimited slots for just a day will cost €5. There are discounts if you opt to rent a server for longer periods, those being three, six, or twelve months. It's a controversial way of monetising things for sure, especially for a game that's still in paid early access.</p><p>Beyond that, update 3 brings nine new cars: three GTs, three special racers, and three road cars. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2, and Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport are the GTs, the Caterham Seven Academy Racer, Dallara Stradale, and the Ferrari F2004 F1 car that a certain Mike Schumacher drove are the specials. Finally, the road cars are the Audi RS 6 Avant, BMW M3 Sport Evo (E30), and that Merc 190E Evo 2 I mentioned earlier. New tracks-wise, Belgian rain magnet Spa and energy drink road the Red Bull Ring have arrived.</p>
<p>When fire them up, you'll likely notice a few other new additions like revamped car audio, a recalibrated tyre simming model, and graphical tweaks which bring in global illumination, optimised CPU/GPU performance especially for bigger grids and "significantly reduced VRAM usage"</p>
<p>So, hopefully less stuttery vroom vrooms when jumping into these new online races. Tell the first road rager who cheekily spins you out and then speeds of sniggering like Dick Dastardly I said hi.</p>

Tasty-looking space games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spark-of-co-op-magic-keeps-jump-space-flying-though-early-access-turbulence">fill</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gorgeous-alien-style-space-horror-routine-is-finally-nearing-the-finish-line-despite-a-key-departure">the</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-space-strategy-sim-nebulous-channels-eight-years-in-the-us-navy">atmosphere</a> nowadays like satellite launch debris, but perhaps you'll find room in your <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38265676">weirdly adapted magnetic fishing net</a> for one more - Kaigan's Nullspace. I came across it in yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndieFanFest">Indie Fan Fest</a> stream, and I quite like the cut of its torpedo bays.
</p>
<p>
Nullspace grabs me for a couple of reasons. One is its "retrofuturistic universe", which strikes me as both sleek and cosy. It's kind of <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/39LP0B">chibi Homeworld</a>. The kitbashed ships come alive with swivelling turrets and manoeuvring jets, but something about the way they're proportioned, patterned and lit also makes me think of freshly piped cake icing. I also quite like the Star Fox-style jabbering heads of unit commanders in the bottom corner.

<p>
The other thing I like is that this is one of those possibly borked genre hybrids, like Shiny Entertainment's Sacrifice or Activision's old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlezone">Battlezone</a> reboot. On the one hand, it's a real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> with planetary bases, various resources to gather, a choice of fleet formations, and the option of either using asteroids for cover or blowing them up for disruption. On the other, it's a dogfighter, with the ability to seize control of any ship and hose the badniks with your own two thumbs. 
</p><p>
The result may prove to be more akin to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> or a punch-up in an Airfix factory than the Battle of New Caprica. There are a couple of moments in the trailer when ships barge into each other like shopping trolleys. But I do like the bustle of it all. 
</p>
<p>
There's a story to reckon with, when you're not making battleships kiss. It channels both "the Golden Age of Sci-Fi" and "deep existential themes". According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363280/NULLSPACE/">the Steam page</a>, you will "lead or challenge factions like the democratic Hegen, the transhumanist Dominion, and the resourceful Junkers as they vie for survival and dominance." Apparently the game contains a "unique take on the Fermi Paradox", this being the contention that we really should have run into some advanced extraterrestrials by now given the amount of stuff there is in outer space. Interested to learn more, I guess.
</p>
<p>
As for those factions, they put me a little in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a>, though they don't seem quite as vicious. Here's the blurb in full:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>The Junkers: Survivors and scavengers, the Junkers live on the fringes of space, salvaging remnants of humanity's past to build a precarious future. Their resourcefulness and ingenuity allow them to adapt to any situation, but their distrust of centralized authority makes them fiercely independent--and difficult to unify.</li>
<li>The Hegen: A powerful, militaristic faction rooted in discipline and order. The Hegen values tradition and hierarchy, believing that humanity's salvation lies in strict control and unwavering loyalty. Their massive fleets and technological prowess make them a force to be reckoned with, but their rigidity may blind them to alternative solutions.</li>
<li>The Dominion: Visionaries, innovators, and seekers of progress, the Dominion is driven by the belief that humanity's evolution lies in embracing new ideas and technologies. They see opportunity in the chaos, pushing boundaries to forge a brighter future, though their relentless pursuit of advancement often clashes with the values of other factions.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>
All told: I can dig it. But do I dig it more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>? I can see representations of gravity wells in the trailer, there, but I doubt it's simulating quite as much stuff. Nullspace hath yet no release date beyond "coming soon".
