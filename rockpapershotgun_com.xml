            <p>The Ukrainian government-run Center for Countering Disinformation have <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/%22%22">released a warning</a> about a new free-to-play shooter, Squad 22: ZOV, which they say is a blaring propaganda instrument for the Russian military that "mythologises" the country's invasion and bombardment of Ukraine since 2022. The accusation actually dates back to February this year, but it has resurfaced and picked up pace online now that Squad 22 is actually on sale via Steam. Valve have yet to comment. </p> <!--more-->
<p>Squad 22: ZOV certainly makes no secret of its affiliations. According to the Steam page, it's "designed with insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers" and "is officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training" - Yunarmy being short for Russia's state-funded Young Army Cadets National Movement. </p>
<p>On the <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">official website</a>, it's further described as being "developed with information support by The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation". Developers SPN Studio cite several military consultants, including a soldier who fought in the "SMO region" between 2014 and 2024 -  SMO being short for "Special Military Operation", the Putin regime's cute little safeword for their perverse and stupid invasion, which has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths on both sides.</p>
<p>The developers have responded to the accusations of being stooges for the Russian military on <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010">Xitter</a>. They appear to be enjoying the adverse reaction, predictably describing it as "free marketing" and inviting people to "put our team on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrotvorets">Mirotvorets</a>", the online repository of "enemies of Ukraine" set up by Ukrainian politician Georgy Tuka back in 2014. They also post a fair bit in support of Russia's assault. Of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent declaration that Ukraine has no plans to capitulate to Russia, the developers comment snidely: "meaning, we will have a lot of content to make more missions in our game".</p>
<p>All of which makes me wonder what, exactly, Valve's policy is towards naked state-backed propaganda games on Steam, of which there are more than a few. According to the developer Twitter feed, Squad 22: ZOV <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010/status/1922915188577030147">passed Steam moderation on 15th May</a>. For all the bragging about Russian heroism on social media, the game's creators strike a timid stance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">the Steam page</a>, promising only to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events" and "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions". I wonder how much, if at all, they had to tweak that wording to satisfy Valve's moderators.</p>
<p>Valve don't explicitly prohibit state-sponsored propaganda on their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/">Steamworks submission page</a>, though they do prohibit hate speech, "libelous or defamatory statements", "content that violates the laws of any jurisdiction in which it will be available", and "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". If they did ban games that explicitly advance the interests of national militaries, they presumably would have taken down the page for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203290/Americas_Army_Proving_Grounds/">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> - the official FPS of the US Army, live on Steam since 2015 - and possibly also Pandemic's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4520/Full_Spectrum_Warrior/">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>, a 2004 tactics game which describes the U.S. Army as "the most powerful ground force in the entire world" and began life as a military training aid.</p>
<p>I make those last comparisons not for the sake of some whatabouttery argument that every side is as bad as the other - amongst the hairs we might split, neither <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/full-spectrum-warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a> nor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/americas-army-proving-grounds">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> is explicitly set in an on-going war, with the prospect of DLC obnoxiously riding on the delaying of a peace settlement - but simply as a reminder that connections between military organisations and the video games industry run deep. Squad 22: ZOV is a real piece of work, but it's far from an anomaly.</p>
<p>I've emailed Valve for comment and will update this piece as and when I receive one. In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362070/Hollow_Home/">the demo for Hollow Home</a>, a Ukrainian-made RPG about the occupation of Mariupol, or check out Frogwares' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-gets-a-surprise-launch-with-a-50-discount-on-steam">recent remaster of The Sinking City</a>, or have a browse of <a href="https://indiecup.net/">the winning entries to last week's Indie Cup Ukraine competition</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam">Game Informer</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/persona-4-remake-is-on-the-way-according-to-one-annoyed-voice-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A voice actor who featured in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4</a> has let slip that a remake of the school days <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> is in the works, mostly because he's frustrated the developers don't want him back to perform as his original character. Yuri Lowenthal, who played clumsy bicycle crasher Yosuke in the original 2008 game, expressed some revealing annoyance with developers Atlus in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">a post</a> on social media that has since been deleted.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," he said. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they donâ€™t want me to come back."</p>
<p>That's not an undeniable signal fire proving the remake's existence, but it is some very billowy smoke. Lowenthal has appeared in the Persona series before, and he was the voice of Eiichiro in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, the recent remake of that entry. So he's close enough to the studio to maybe know a thing or two about what's going on. He's also voiced a certain neighbourhood webslinger in various Spider-Man games over the years, as well as Mylo from Arcane, and absolute sidequest liability <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_(Final_Fantasy_VII)">Johnny</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> remakes. </p>
<p>He's not the only one seemingly snubbed by Atlus. Erin Fitzgerald, the voice of Chie, has also complained of the developers' reluctance to have her return, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/persona/former-persona-4-actors-seemingly-keep-revealing-a-new-jrpg-remake-from-atlus-by-confirming-they-wont-be-in-it-i-have-not-been-asked-to-reprise-my-role/">Gamesradar</a>. 

</p><p>"For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake," she said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinfitzgerald.bsky.social/post/3lqbi6257w22d">her own post</a>. "I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her."</p>
<p>Hopes for a Persona 4 remake have persisted among fans, I'm told, since the third game got its makeover. Meanwhile, many folks are doubtless frothing at the mouth for a Persona 6 announcement, which has yet to materialise, with Atlus instead announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-persona-5-spinoff-is-launching-next-month-this-time-a-gacha-game-with-a-new-group-of-phantom-thieves">yet another Persona 5 spinoff</a> earlier this month. </p>
<p>Whether a remake is strictly necessary is another thing. A PC remaster of Persona 4 came out in 2020 in the form of Persona 4 Golden, which our Edwin called "a twisting tale of dreams gone rogue in a town sapped of purpose" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/persona-4-golden-review">his review</a>. If you want a second opinion, my cousin - who just phoned me to chat and who delayed this article from being written by at least one hour - instructed me to review all Persona games with the following single-sentence summary: "Too much text." And you know what? I might agree. 100 hours to complete a game? Please. I barely think I have 100 hours left to live.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel has shed its Project Orion codename and will now be known as... Cyberpunk 2. CD Projekt revealed the name change in their <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">latest earnings results</a>, according to which the new Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has just entered pre-production - roughly defined, the point in a game's gestation when designers, artists, programmers and so forth meet to flesh out the concept, but before they've actually started making anything that's supposed to form part of the finished game. There are now 96 people working on the thing, versus 422 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, 49 on multiplayer Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and 19 for an unannounced original game, Project Hadar.</p>
<p>The grousing, dilettante reader will object that this is scant material for a news post, especially given that CD Projekt are offering no guarantees that "Cyberpunk 2" will be the project's final name - as they commented to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">Verge</a>, Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe." But the dextrous maven of online news-mongering will notice that "Cyberpunk 2" is, in fact, an extremely compact and subtle piece of worldbuilding.</p> <!--more-->
<p>After all, Cyberpunk 2077 is set in the year 2077 CE. By logical extrapolation, Cyberpunk 2 is set in the year 2. Combine that with a hint from Cyberpunk tabletop creator Mike Pondsmith that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-will-see-you-return-to-night-city-and-head-to-a-new-city-described-as-chicago-gone-wrong">nu-Cyberpunk will take place in Chicago</a>, and we can make deductions about Cyberpunk 2's setting by copy-pasting bits of this randomly googled <a href="http://livinghistoryofillinois.com/pdf_files/Timeline%20of%20Illinois%20History.pdf">Living History Of Illinois</a>, with its trust-inspiring emblem of a sickly and loquacious bald eagle attempting to disentangle itself from a discarded shield.</p>
<p>Here is what the nauseous avian scholars of the Living History of Illinois think occurred in the years 500 BC to 900 AD: maize agriculture, village-building, burial mounds, pottery, and the invention of the bow and arrow. That's pretty much a video game, right there. But is it a Cyberpunk game? I have now completed a forensic control+F search on that PDF several hundred times, and can disclose zero mention of "ripperdocs", "braindancing", or "taxi missions that are secretly better than the main storyline". If the indigenous peoples who lived on the banks of what would later be called the Mississippi River had access to aerodynes and quickhacking, they kept it on the down-low. Possibly instead of aerodynes they had barfing bald eagles.</p>
<p>CD Projekt have yet to explicitly confirm anything about the new Cyberpunk's setting, beyond saying that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">want to explore problems like homelessness and the wealth gap</a>. I'd email them a link to this report, asking for a statement, but I love CD Projekt like my very own children, and do not wish to encumber them with some abject nonsense. You, on the other hand, are welcome to leave a comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've never been so happy to see a spike trap as I was in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/debugging-hero">Debugging Hero</a>. At the start of each combat encounter, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406850/Debugging_Hero/">the demo</a> for this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> hack n' slash hands you several numeric cards and lets you pause the game to view both your and your enemies' stats: health, damage, and durability. You then drag the cards on to the relevant stat to modify it, then unpause to continue real-time combat.</p>
<p>It's a cute gimmick, letting you knock down high health enemies to a manageable number, or kill weak ones outright, or heal yourself. But it felt a tad shallow to carry a whole game, even one with dodges and parries in its real-time combat. Then, I entered a room with a trap tile that thrust sharpened spikes upwards at timed intervals, and realised I could manipulate the timer. I tuned it right down, and raucously chortled like a portly racoon at the bakery bins as it pneumatically skewered my idiot attackers.</p>

<p>When I fought the first boss, I noticed I could also slow down his attack intervals, letting me poke with relative impunity for long stretches. You can also mess with projectiles like arrows, slowing them down or reducing their damage. Whether Debugging Hero stays interesting is definitely going to rely on how many new ideas it introduces past the demo - even then, I don't think it's going for something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>'s depth. But, being the Adorno to Edwin's Benjamin in the seminal Marge Simpson School Of Potato Critique, I am compelled to award Debugging Hero our most prestigious accolade: it's neat. The game's out tomorrow, May 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In 2023 EA opened a new studio named Cliffhanger Games, led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, and announced a new third-person, singleplayer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-and-marvel-announce-a-black-panther-game-set-in-wakanda">starring Marvel's Black Panther</a>. They've now cancelled that game and shut down that studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN report</a>.</p>
<p>According to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, via an email sent to employees, this has been done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Additionally, both EA's mobile and central teams will see an unconfirmed number of layoffs - understood by IGN to be less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">the 300 workers laid off in April</a>. From the report:</p>
<blockquote>"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people weâ€™ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. Weâ€™re doing everything we can to support them â€” including finding opportunities within EA, where weâ€™ve had success helping people land in new roles.</blockquote>
<p>EA are reportedly making efforts to find affected workers other roles within the company, via an internal placement programs. "Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues," Miele told IGN, while also saying in the original email that EA would be focusing on Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> going forward.</p>
<p>EA employees were left "upset and confused" at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">return to office mandate</a> earlier this month. In-person work, said CEO Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, leads to "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players". Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">EA laid off 5% of their workforce</a>, (around 670). Despite these recent layoffs, the company now employs 800 more people than this time last year, <a href="http://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">report Game File</a> (paywalled). IGN note this is likely due to EA increasing the size of core teams, which scans with Miele's stated focus on a few select game series.</p>
<p>Between them, Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/EGpW3RvZP2o">good video on the EA-published Spore</a> I watched some of last night. When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a> was released, it shipped with some undisclosed dodgy DRM software named Securom that limited each copy to three device installs via a code. If you happened to upgrade your hardware during this time, there's a chance you would have been locked out of playing the game you bought. Partly as a result, Spore remains one of the most pirated games of all time, although whether you should pirate every product Andrew Wilson has a hand in from now until the end of time is the sort of question you'll have to answer yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
