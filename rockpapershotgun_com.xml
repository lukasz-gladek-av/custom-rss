            <p>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The result? A pretty forgettable video game. This is the first time anybody at Rock Paper Shotgun has ever posted specifically about Dark Sector, in fact. But Dark Sector's stature, if not its quality, has swelled in hindsight - for it's sort of the 'original version' of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, the absurdly over-dressed free-to-play shooter that hopefully needs no introduction. If you're a Warframer who's up for a roady-run down memory lane, Digital Extremes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/">currently giving Dark Sector away on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Dark Sector takes place in an approximately real-world, present-day setting, albeit one full of "Technocyte" bioweapons, but it was once envisaged as a sci-fi, outer-space affair in which you'd play a character with a fancy mechsuit.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes eventually dialled the sci-fi elements back to make the story more relatable to players of the era - this was the mid-noughties, don't forget, when every game had to vaguely resemble a less-good Bruce Willis film. But after releasing Dark Sector, they dug up their original notes and spun them out into the concept for Warframe. There are a few reverential nods to Dark Sector in the latter, including a fancier species of glaive.</p><p>If you're enticed by Dark Sector's sheer OK-ness, you'll want to get your skates on. It's free only till Saturday November 30th at 9am PT, 12pm ET, 5pm GMT and 6pm CET. The thinking behind the discount is to celebrate Warframe's forthcoming 1999 expansion, which takes the series back in time. Look out for that in December. I'm personally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">more interested in Digital Extremes' fantasy RPG Soulframe right now than Warframe</a>, largely because after 10 years of updates, Warframe feels too big and knotty to get my head around.</p>
<p>If you're unconvinced by Dark Sector, even at the low, low price of nada multiplied by nothing, I have a bonus ancient Digital Extremes game to share - The Darkness 2, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/67370/The_Darkness_II/">is currently 80% off</a>. This one's a sequel to the Starbreeze game about the trenchcoat gangster with snake hands, and it's actually quite decent - decent enough to make Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">Celebration Of Perfectly Average Action Games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you don't secretly spend most afternoons plotting an eventual career change to one where you're surrounded by animals, then I'm sorry, but you're just not welcome in the RPS treehouse. Today, Kiera is taking a definitive step forward in that plan: she's departing RPS for a new playthrough of life, one where the animal sliders are all cranked up to max. Join us in saying fare-thee-well below.</p><!--more-->
<p>Kiera joined the guides branch of the treehouse just over a year ago, and along with fellow new hire Jeremy she was promptly baptised in that familiar river of hot magma known as "this year's Call Of Duty". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023">50-odd gun guides later</a>, she solo-led our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-tips-and-tricks">Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</a> guides coverage with a series of clear and carefully-written guides that made it look like she'd been here for years, not weeks. I'm planning a playthrough of Avatar soon and I'll for sure be dipping into her guides for that.</p>
<p>Then the new year came around, and thank goodness Kiera was around so she could help us tackle the googly-eyed mammoth that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-tips-and-tricks">Palworld</a>. Kiera spent a brain-melting number of hours delving into that gigantic game, resurfacing only to send me a new link to another expansive guide on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-ice-pals">best Ice Pals</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-electric-pals">best Electric Pals</a>, even comprehensive lists on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-pal-list">where to find all 137 Pal types</a>... It can't have been easy, nor particularly fun I'd wager, but the quality of her work never wavered. And then she went through the same thing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-walkthrough">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, churning out excellent guides like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-romance-gifts">this one on the game's romance and affinity systems</a>.</p>
<p>The same was true for the countless updates and refreshes of older guides that Kiera took care of over these past 12 months. Everything from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> primers to our vast number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> guides has been improved over the past year, thanks largely to Kiera's tireless work to keep everything as up-to-date and easy to follow as possible. Juggling new releases, old update projects, and the ever-present burden of thinking up hints every day for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wordle">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/connections">Connections</a> guides is far from easy, but she always got it done, and she did great work every time.</p><p>Despite the workload, she also found time for some lovely bespoke pieces on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">making a witchy cottage in Tiny Glade</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-recreate-stray-in-lethal-company-with-disastrous-results">attempting to recreate Stray in Lethal Company</a>. It's a shame that 2024 dropped so many gigantic bombshells of work upon us, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-best-weapons">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-best-syndicate">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-veilguard-romance-options">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>, because I'd have loved Kiera to have had more time to write more of these weird and wonderful posts throughout the year. That said, even in the midst of a stupidly busy and tumultuous year, Kiera still found time to write great guides on smaller games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palia-money-making-tips">Palia</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-carrying-capacity-upgrade">Lightyear Frontier</a>, games which we can't often cover but still deserve love and attention.</p>
<p>Please join me in saying farewell to Kiera in the comments below. We usually say that once you leave the treehouse you're dead to us, but in this case, we'll welcome her back every so often in exchange for some good doggo photos, and more pictures of exquisitely painted miniatures with large froggy posteriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a>. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how <em>she's over there</em>, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First things first - the new "Special Campaign" mode is basically the shooter's equivalent of new game plus. It will let players replay the campaign (as it exists so far) "but with unique Endgame Content and Randomization," say developers Altered Orbit in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4702411539870497570">the update post</a>. It'll add random enemy encounters and give weapons ARPG style rarity colours, among other tweakable settings.</p>
<p>There were plans to call this "Randomizer" mode but it seems the devs have redesigned and rebranded it. As with classic examples of new game plus, you'll need to have already completed the game to unlock this new special mode (or, in this case, chapter one of the campaign - what exists of the game so far). </p>
<p>But more fun than this new mode, for me, are the ways the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>-like enemy patrol goons have been further improved. Like I've mentioned, they'll fall over when you throw a plate at them, but also now stumble if you blast them in the leg. They'll take increased damage when frozen by frosty grenades, and make more callouts to one another when looking for the player (for example, they will now yell about your flashlight giving you away). </p>

<p>There's a miscellany of other improvements, such as snappier Halo-style melee attacks, and a bunch of balancing to various firearms. There are also many bug fixes. "Throwing toilets against enemies no longer crashes the game," we're told. "Fixed a rare bug where enemies killed by electricity would instead become invincible." God, I love patch notes.</p><p>As for the noise - there's more of that too. "Improved oomph for Fire Extinguisher explosions," yell the patch notes enthusiastically. "Improved sound effect when walking over glass," another note screams. "Went nuts on the audio design for bullet impacts and whizzes," a third note whispers, but with a manic and delighted look that implies there is a landmine nearby. Don't worry, the mine's explosive radius has been nerfed by almost 50%. You'll be fine.</p>
<p>It's a fairly hefty update, which the developer cites as the reason for a delay in the story stuff that was planned to get players closer to their protagonist. Narrative additions they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noisy-shooter-selaco-is-steam-deck-verified-with-new-story-stuff-ai-improvements-and-randomizer-modes-in-the-works">previously mentioned</a> include "a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot". That was planned for the end of this year, but it's been pushed back a couple months to January or February next year, say the devs. In the meantime, work on the second chapter of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> "continues to progress rapidly," they say, dropping hints of deployable turrets, miniguns, and... is that a mech suit? Interesting.</p>

<p>If Selaco's many additions and alterations are sometimes difficult to follow, it's partly because the devs don't use a roadmap like other studios might during early access. "Roadmaps tend to have a negative effect on development/work," they've <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791469846912&amp;emgid=4374768959778727710">said in the past</a>. "Experimentation with new ideas takes time, while roadmaps are schedule-focused and don't allow for such things."</p><p>However they're doing things, it seems to be working just fine. Ed liked Selaco when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">reviewed the first early access build</a>, calling it a work of impressive "GZDoom wizardry" and praising those cunning AI enemies. Here's what he had to say about the running and/or gunning.</p>
<blockquote>Firefights are a festival of debris, where it rains printer paper and computer monitors crackle and alien troops coat everything in a sticky purple gunk when you explode them. While the result of your bullets can be quite chaotic, gunfights straddle the line between tactical and balls-to-the-wall boomer shooter really well...</blockquote>
<p>It's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">discounted in Steam's Autumn sale</a>, if you like a bit of noise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
