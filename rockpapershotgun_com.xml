            <p>If, like me, you ended up keeping a bit of an eye on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> once its release popped into view like a weird mind portal, you might remember one of the execs behind it causing a fuss with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-concerted-effort-against-it">some Discord comments</a> alleging bots were being used to bad mouth the game.
</p>
<p>Well, in a twist that'd be strange for other games, but feels pretty par the course for this one, developer Build A Rocket Boy's now denied that it's been using bots to say nice things about MindsEye. This wasn't totally out of the blue. Some folks had spotted some posts about the game with suspiciously similar wording.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling," the studio tweeted in response to a thread that saw journos Mike Channell and Kirk McKeand highlight some examples of potentially botty MindsEye posting.</p>
<p>"BARB has never used any bots nor will we. We’re pumped to see players loving the latest MindsEye update! #NoBots". Cor, a hashtag and everything.</p>
<p>As a, well, a social media weirdness masochist for lack of a better term, I decided to look into the examples cited by Channell and McKeand myself. I also quickly checked to see if I could find more examples of multiple posts about MindsEye that use weirdly similar language - such as all insisting that the game's given them goosebumps, before casually listing the different systems you can play it on in a manner that's not at all sales-pitchy.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey both, thanks for flagging. Taking a minute to set the record straight and refute this, and other false claims that are swirling.

<p>Quick scans through the comments and Twitter replies on <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1933592983980400804">IGN</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eurogamer/status/1934580739859009561">Eurogamer</a>'s MindsEye reviews - with two comments that are exactly the same left in the Facebook comments on the latter having kicked off Channell's thread - didn't reveal anything I'd class as sticking out beyond the norms I'd expect from your average internet comments section.
</p>
<p>Looking into the post histories of the accounts in the goosebumps-citing post chain McKeand shared a screenshot of, I did find that <a href="https://x.com/Ashleykate_3">two</a> of <a href="https://x.com/jus_stark">them</a> have only existed since April this year, and that the former also <a href="https://x.com/jus_stark/status/1933486172874870976">retweeted</a> one of the latter's weird MindsEye posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one put out <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1932708620388778049">four</a> very <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1932719162478281043">similar</a> and very <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1933279562785566823">promo-y</a> <a href="https://x.com/onlinenow99/status/1933284779392446726">posts</a> about Mindseye across June 11th and 12th alone, all of which hype it up and mention the platforms it's available on. It even retweeted one of them in that same timeframe.</p>
<p>Based on the few examples I looked at, I'd say this feels like it could pretty easily just be your standard weird engagement-farming bot activity done in isolation, rather than the potential astroturfing suggested in the original thread. And again, BARB have denied it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The best thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so many games. The most terrifying thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so damn many games. It's no surprise then, that according to calculations by developer Chris Hanney and the GameDiscoverCo newsletter, the latest summer Next Fest continued a trend of substantial year-on-year demo number growth.</p>
<p>Hanney, a dev on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-pirate-trainer">Space Pirate Trainer</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> among others, has had a go at pulling the numbers on the numbers of demos uploaded to Steam during each next fest running back to 2019's Game Awards-adjacent first edition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hanney.bsky.social/post/3lrrxxznsis2m">Hanney's findings</a>, that December 2019 Steam Game Festival saw just 44 demos go live, whereas the latest June 2025 Next Fest included 1994 of them, all vying for your eyeballs, keyboards, mice, and firstborn children. On the other hand, GameDiscoverCo's <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-june-2025s-steam-next-fest">latest newsletter</a> cites the latter number as being in the region of 2,600 demos. As GameDiscover's Simon Carless points out: "It’s difficult to get an exact demo count, because lots of games drop out late or don’t submit valid demos and have to be culled."</p>
<p>Hanney's graph cites the numbers as being pretty stable between 160-ish on the low end to 300 demos on the higher end per fest throughout most of 2020 to 2022, with some fluctuation up and down. Then, things hit June 2023, which had 344 demos, and haven't stopped increasing since then. The biggest jump it cites is from 1079 demos in 2024's October Next Fest to 1710 in this February's edition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GameDiscoverCo's data has October 2024's Next Fest at an even higher number of demos than June '25, putting it at 3,008. The thing both sources have in common is pointing to a general year-on-year increase in demo numbers from June 2023 to this month, aligning with the idea that Next Fests are generally getting more crowded as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, what kind of boost did the top performers get out of this latest Next Fest, with all of that competition? Well, taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> out of the equation as GameDiscoverCo cites it as a bit of an outlier since it fully launched during this June's Next Fest, two games are cited as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFAPcHkdkjZppOxWHlU6sq3qNqWBe3ExLXrDNyzEVpU/edit?gid=479676648#gid=479676648">having gained over 100,000 wishlists</a>. ARPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus-defying-fate">Vindictus: Defying Fate</a> was the best non-SB performer, adding 151,605 wishlists to push its pre-fest total of 592,569 up to 744,174. Meanwhile, third place Dispatch gained 110,239 to go from 434,671 to 544,910.</p>
<p>Most of the top titles saw their wishlists multiply by similar factor in proportion to their pre-fest total. The biggest growers, and the exceptions to that trend, were the likes of Mr. Billion: Idle Rich Tycoon - which went from 864 pre-fest wishlists to 22,788, multiplying its wishlist total by 26 in the process. Topping that growth was bullet hell roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terratech">TerraTech</a> Legion, which the data cites as having grown from one solitary wishlist to 20,715, multiplying its total by, er, 20,715.</p>
<p>I looked at the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-announcements-of">publication's data</a> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T__AlDt9BDFsKutObeaijwp7oI9Z4Def8sGNO8GMT_Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0">'Not-E3' showcase season wishlist bumps</a>, and Next Fests are still lagging a bit behind those numbers at this point, though it is worth noting Vindictus: Defying Fate's Next Fest wishlist increase would have put it just inside the top 10 of that ranking of 'Not-E3' games' wishlists in the five days after they made their showcase appearances. Just behind Grounded 2 at 168,409 and ahead of the likes of Nioh 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics, though all of those games' totals were stating from zero.</p>
<p>GameDiscoverCo noted in its <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-games-hit-big-in-steams-feb?open=false#%C2%A7which-games-hit-big-in-the-feb-next-fest">February 2025 Next Fest analysis</a> that comparing that iteration to February 2024's Fest illustrated the top demos benefitting by a tiny bit more, while there was much more interest in the games further down the publication top 100 rankings, with the caveat that the substantial year-on-year growth in the total number of demos in the Next Fest arena is likely making it a lot tougher to get close to the top 100 spots.</p>
<p>This is the point that inspired Hanney's post, with the growth of Next Fests changing what they represent from the perspectives of game makers looking to use them to get eyes on their works. "The best worst part of this is always - every GDC talk [on launching games via Steam and gaining traction] is already out of date by the time it is given," wrote former Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3lrryp4swvc2g">a reply</a> to the post, "You have to be always moving, always trying new things."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
