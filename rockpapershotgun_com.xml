        <p>I was going to do a ‘Kermit/Commit’ bit, but then you’d all just be insufferable about frogs and toads</p>

            <p>In all honesty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toads-of-the-bayou">Toads Of The Bayou</a> could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190400/Toads_of_the_Bayou/">Steam demo</a> ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into The Breach</a>: turn based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.</p>

<p>Toads Of The Bayou loves shops, is the first thing I found out about it. There’s four different ones in your home base, where you’ll lead a rebellion against Haitian Vodou figure Baron Samedi. You’ll select missions from a map, gather resources, then spent them on either more combat cards, companions, or single use traps and various other bufo-buffs. You’ve also got your own inventory of consumable items, and your starting toad generates barricades by killing enemies, which you can plonk down on a map - helpful, since most maps have an objective to project.</p>
<p>If you fail an objective, you’ll get ‘curse cards’ put into your deck, which can then show up randomly and ruin your day. Allegedly anyway, I was simply too good to have this happen. Cards cost action points, and there’s a few neat twists even in the small slice I played. Your movement card, for example, is free to play, but loses one movement per card you’ve played before it. So you can attack before moving, but you’ll be less effective. Some cards push enemies into obstacles for extra damage, and some let you switch places with them, which you can use to your advantage since they’ll be locked into their attacks by then. </p><p>There’s also permadeath, but it’s the fun kind that gives you upgrades for the next run. It all seems a fair bit more thoughtful and expansive than what I’d originally suspected, which was rote turn-based combat coasting on the back of its very good toads. But it does not coast, and the toads are better for it. It’s also out this month if you like the demo - 19th November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a>, Nvidia’s PC-focused game streaming service, will begin calling time on its most muscular of power users. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">post on the GFN subreddit</a> announced the introduction of a 100-hour monthly cap (or "allowance"), effective from January 1st 2025 for anyone who signs up after that date. Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nvidia claim the vital importance of this hitherto completely unnecessary limit involves "providing exceptional quality and speed — as well as shorter queue times", and that 100 hours per month will "comfortably" accommodate 94% of current users. Obviously, if you are part of that remaining 6%, your newfound constraints won’t be reflected in any kind of subscription price cut or discount. But hey, you can always pay Nvidia <em>more</em> cash to unlock extra time. $6 for 15 hours on the Ultimate tier, to be exact, or $3 for 15 hours on the Priority tier, which is being renamed Performance.</p>
<p>15 hours of any unused time will also carry over each month, though even with these small concessions, I’m not sure that they’ll be enough to convince both heavy users and potential new customers to get on board. Would you sign up for <em>any</em> subscription service knowing it’s going to become materially worse in a year’s time? And for what purpose? Nvidia cite the relatively small proportion of users who’d exceed a 100-hour limit as justification for imposing it, but by that same logic, it’s only a handful of people jostling for that extra bandwidth. Anecdotally, I sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">use GeForce Now for playing Steam Deck games</a> that the handheld itself can’t handle, and I’ve never had trouble with queue times or streaming quality. If these 6% are a drain on the system, they’re being awfully polite about it.</p>
<p>What’s also a shame is that this "allowance" is being foisted alongside a range of other changes that, largely, sound quite good. The Performance-née-Priority membership will start offering 2560x1440 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide</a> resolution options, with ultrawide previously being exclusive to the Ultimate tier, and both types are gaining the ability to save custom graphics setting configurations across different streaming sessions. Alas, the march of service decay continues, with the only way to continue enjoying unlimited streaming time being a GeForce Now Founders subscription – and those haven’t been available for new signups since 2021.</p>
<p>In other news, Nvidia this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-surpasses-36-trillion-market-value-after-trump-win-2024-11-07/">surpassed a market value of $3.6 trillion</a>, a global first that cemented their position above Apple as the world’s most valuable company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Could tower defence be the ultimate "it's Friday and I am here in body only" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rift-riff">Rift Riff</a>'s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle <em>just</em> right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.</p>
<p>Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hidden-folks">Hidden Folks</a> designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>. There's a demo, if you fancy it.</p><!--more-->
<p>Rift Riff's singleplayer offerings are split between several dimensions. In each dimension, you build a home base and surround it with synergistic fortifications to stave off waves of marauding inkblot creatures, using their spilled "juice" to fund additional structures. It's an "open field" tower defender, with attackers emerging from portals around the map rather than following strict lanes (you're told how many are coming from each portal before rounds, but not what kind), and construction permitted only on certain sites.</p>
<p>In the demo, you get rapidfire turrets, tall sniper's eyries, AOE-lobbing cannons, and thumpers which slow attackers nearby. There are more towers and upgrades to unlock between dimensions, while roaming an Eschery hive of obsidian staircases.</p>
<p>The full game is out in 2025. If I had a request, it would be more playfulness with the fundamentals. Give us some of the old Hidden Folks whimsy - what John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hidden-folks-review">called</a> "the feeling of a puzzle book that's magically come alive, a Where's Wally where you get to poke and prod the characters". Anyway, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800900/Rift_Riff/">Rift Riff</a> on Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
