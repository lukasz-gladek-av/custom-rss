            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> is ditching its Denuvo anti-tamper software as part of developers' Tango Gameworks transition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">working under new owners Krafton</a>. A fresh patch has been released swapping logos to reflect that switch in management, and you'll need to install it before mid-January if you want the game to stay playable.</p>
<p>Krafton, of course, bought up Tango after the studio's former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced plans to shut it down</a> back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> developers Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom creators Alpha Dog Games.</p>

<p>Cue Hi-Fi Rush <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626833?l=english">patch 10</a>, released earlier today. It makes no changes to the game bits of the game, instead mainly handling the admin of crossing out old publisher logos in favour of Krafton ones.</p>
<p>There is, however, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">one key wrinkle</a> it's well worth you being aware of. The patch has removed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-the-state-of-drm-in-2020">Denuvo's controversial anti-piracy/DRM software</a> from the game, with support for it set to end in full as of January 16th. As a result of that, Tango make clear that grabbing patch 10 by that date is mandatory, as "significant changes" made to Hi-Fi Rush's "internal system structure" in the Denuevo removal mean that the game'll no longer run without this latest patch installed after that point.</p><p>"Please note that even after Denuvo is removed, the game’s own anti-tampering features will remain active and will not affect normal gameplay," Tango added, just in case you were wondering if the security guards were being permanently dismissed from Hi-Fi's door.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">our review</a> of the rhythm action romp, Hirun Cryer dubbed it "a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming". "The combat system is surprisingly deep and malleable for any style of player and meshing it gently into the musical beat without putting pressure on the player is a deft touch," he continued. "Its writing and characters might leave a little to be desired, especially when compelling narrative beats are so painfully overlooked, but that doesn’t stop the entire package from being a certified banger."</p>
