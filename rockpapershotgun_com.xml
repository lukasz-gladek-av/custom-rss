I think as long as you make a new year's update post before the incredibly arbitrary date of January 13th, you're still able to do so without me thinking "come on, it's almost February", which is exactly what EA did with their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">new years Sims update post</a>. Perhaps reassuringly, after word came last year of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">EA's concerning acquisition</a>, the post opens by doubling down on what the team has previously said regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">staying committed to their values</a> (those values <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">including inclusivity</a> is welcome though I wish they'd be more explicit about who is being included). But the post also, sort of, goes into what's next for the series.
</p>
<p>
Top of the order of importance is potentially the fact that Project Rene, i.e. not-Sims 5 with an emphasis on multiplayer, is now being described as a "mobile-first" game. The post is explicit about it not being "the successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>," noting it is an "experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience." But its future on PC, or any other platform, is now up in the air.
</p>
<p>
One thing the post does make clear is the studio's commitment to single-player games, even if Project Rene is meant to be more collaborative. "Single-player PC and console experiences will always be a part of our future, with more than half of our global development team dedicated to The Sims 4 and the next evolution," the post explains, though what about that last bit, the next evolution? "More news in the coming months!" Very helpful, thanks.
</p>
<p>
We already know there's not going to be a Sims 5, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">at least last time I checked anyway</a>, so this evolution is limited in its potential. Perhaps a big refresh for The Sims 4? It certainly could do with one, given it's over a decade old now. We'll find out in those theoretically coming months!

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye, another extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is almost upon us, this time the smaller but still quite bold in scope Sand: Raiders of Sophie. Last time I personally heard of this game it was just called Sand, which doesn't sound great for that whole search engine thing, though I'm not entirely convinced by the subtitle. Anyway, this extraction shooter is set in an alternate 1910 where you get to roam the desert in a steampunky fortress with legs, and it's got a release month!
</p>
<p>
That release month isn't too far away either, being March, though a month is all you're getting right now as there's no specific date in sight. The perils of game development, I would guess. For those that haven't heard of Sand before, it's a PvPvE extraction shooter where you build large, mobile buildings called Tramplers, a sort of 20th century version of the titular castle from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>'s Moving Castle. You then operate these Tramplers, driving them around so to speak, taking down other players' creations with various weapons you may have attached.

<p>
On the ground level, you as essentially a regular Joe will trawl the "once-resource-rich world of Sophie," all so that you can "uncover hidden riches in the barren wastelands, rectify historical injustices," and lay claim to what you believe is rightfully yours (what that is, I can't tell you). 
</p><p>
There's shooting, there's things to find and extract, there's not-zombies to keep you on your toes when other players aren't about. All of it looks fairly par for the course, the real selling point here are the Tramplers, at least from an outside perspective. If any of this takes your fancy, you can wishlist Sand: Raiders of Sophie right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/SAND_Raiders_of_Sophie/">here</a>.

            <p>
Last year, after a bit of a wait, Silent Hill was released, and with it came some changes to the series. The combat was a lot more actiony, the format for multiple endings was drastically different, but the most obvious change was its setting. We're not in Silent Hill anymore, Toto! We're in Ebisugaoka, Japan, also a fictional town, though clearly not a fictional country. And that's because Silent Hill, the place, is now also Silent Hill, the "phenomenon."
</p>
<p>
Writer of the game Ryukishi07 recently shared in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/53254">Famitsu</a> (ta for the translations, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-is-not-just-the-name-of-a-place-it-is-a-phenomenon-silent-hill-f-writer-doubles-down-on-theory-from-a-short-message-that-had-the-fanbase-divided/">GamesRadar</a>) that he felt unsure of why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> would be set in Japan. "I discussed a lot of things with series producer [Motoi] Okamoto in a meeting after I received the request [to write Silent Hill f,]" Ryukishi07 shared. 
</p>
<p>
"Like 'Why is it set in Japan?' and 'What exactly is Silent Hill?'" But it was while speaking with Okamoto that the pair "came to the conclusion that Silent Hill is not just the name of a place, it is a phenomenon. Looking back I think I was able to create a pretty satisfying base for the story and world from this."
</p>
<p>
You might remember that such a thing was even referenced in The Short Message, which quite literally makes mention of a "Silent Hill phenomenon." I'm certainly not opposed to the series taking a more anthological approach, I even think that's what it should be doing. But I have to say that putting a name to it feels a bit too much like showing your hand. Revel in the mystery, in the unknown, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>! It's more fun that way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, weirdly revealing choice or not, I do actually think Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">quite good</a>, and worth a pop yourself if you haven't given it a chance already.
