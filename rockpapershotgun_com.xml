            <p>What with all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">countersuits</a> between publishers Krafton and certain former Unknown Worlds executives, you could be forgiven for thinking that "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>" is some kind of arcane courtroom term - a compact way of saying "vicious haggling over withheld bonuses", perhaps. Here's a new developer diary video to remind us that Subnautica 2 is actually an underwater sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. It doesn't have any lawyers in it, but it does have a massive peckish tentacle monster. Set that one up for you, comments thread comedians!
</p><!--more-->
<p>Shared on <a href="https://press.krafton.com/UNKNOWN-WORLDS-REVEALS-THE-COLLECTOR-LEVIATHAN-IN-SUBNAUTICA-2">Krafton's press site</a>, the video introduces the Collector Leviathan, which appears to be a giant squid except it only has four tentacles/arms, not the regulation 10, unless you include all the tiny wiggly ones around its mouth.

<p>Given its embarrassing tentacle deficiency, it's no shock to read that the Collector Leviathan is an "irritable" creature. If it sees you, it will emit a noisy shockwave and jet towards you with body laid horizontal. Then, it will rear up vertical to give you a lovely look at its volcanic split cranium and painterly bioluminescent forehead patterns. Then it will grab you with a tentacle and eat you.</p><p>It's definitely better to be inside a submarine when this happens, but it's even better to not let it happen at all. Hide from the Collector, and it will eventually lose interest and glide away. You can also lure it off by throwing a flare.
</p>
<p>I dread meeting something this big in a real-world aquatic context, but I do like watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJtd9BLCuc">human divers encountering more reasonably sized cephalopods</a>. I hear that octopus arms contain <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/">"partly independent mini brains"</a>, and that they <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/how-octopuses-and-squids-change-color">both deceive predators and court mates</a> using colour changes.</p>
<p>Please put some of that in Subnautica 2, Unknown Worlds. I'd suggest letting players talk to the Collector Leviathan by means of chromophore mechanics, but that would risk aggravating both Edge Magazine and <a href="https://tomscullin.medium.com/the-limits-of-language-wittgensteins-lion-analogy-a2d4baa5bd20">Wittgenstein</a>, and I make it a rule never to piss both of them off at once. Also, now that I consider it, maybe don't give the Collector active camo - the prospect of it sneaking up on me through murky water is quite harrowing enough.
</p>
<p>The video is a tacit reminder from Krafton that there are still "veteran developers" at Unknown Worlds following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the sudden ejection of Subnautica 2 director Charlie Cleveland, studio CEO Ted Gill, and co-founder Max McGuire</a>. It's a 10 minute walkthrough of the Collector's creation that doubles as a dissection of the production itself - transporting us from concept sketches through modelling and animation to the creation of visual effects and AI behaviours.
</p><p>There's a teasing glimpse of a doc from September 2024, created by game designer Louis Karim, which rolls through how the Collector conveys its alertness through posture and sound. As regards some of the game's areas, at least, it will spawn at a distance from the player and despawn when you're sufficiently far away. It's a relief to learn that there's only one present per session, even during co-op. All this is WIP, mind.
</p>
<p>The doc also mentions a couple of in-game biomes, Sparse Plains and Outer Bounds, plus a blurred-out reference to another Leviathan. There's an untitled image of a third creature that looks like a piscine aeroplane. Apparently you will encounter the Collector in the course of "pearl interactions". Perhaps we'll have to crack open giant clam shells while avoiding the megasquid's attention.
</p>
<p>The September 2024 doc will likely be of interest to the Subnautical subredditors who are trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">gauge the completeness of Subnautica 2 from leaked materials</a>. The current pie-slinging match between Krafton's lawyers and those of the departed Unknown Worlds execs hinges on whether or not the game is fit for early access release this year. 
</p>
<p>Krafton claim it needs more time to cook, partly because the bygone Unknown Worlds bigwigs have been shirking their responsibilities, and are only interested in money. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire insist that the game was substantial enough for launch this year, and that Krafton only delayed it because they're welching on a timed $250 million earn-out. I am having more fun thinking about the tentacles.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> has launched its 1.0 version today, September 17th, ending the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">DRG</a> spinoff’s two-year spell in early access.</p>
<p>Despite some initial umming and ahhing about how a comedy co-op FPS would translate into a single-player autoshooter – if I press the Rock and Stone button and nobody hears, did I say Rock and Stone? – DRG: Survivor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">quickly won me over</a>, thanks in particular to the tension and horde-dodging trickery afforded by its adaptation of the original game’s pickaxe mining. I’ve also had a little go on the 1.0 build ahead of release, and it does indeed feel like the most complete, well-tuned version yet.</p>

<p>The big additions are a new escort mission type, inspired by (yet sadly not also starring) Dotty the Drilldozer from OG Deep Rock, and the Gear system, which provides an alternative to the persistent upgrades shop by rewarding successful runs with equippable clobber. Your bearded exterminator can only don a handful of these at a time, but they grant juicier stat boosts than the upgrades that your cash and minerals will stretch to in the early game, so they’re good for a more tangible power boost.</p>
<p>Per-run, XP-earned weapon upgrades also seem slightly more generous than I remember from various early access builds, and the lower hazard levels (or difficulties, if you’re a smooth-handed leaf lover) are generally more forgiving. That all gives DRG: Survivor a much more welcoming introductory phase, though there are also plenty of nasty mutators in the Anomaly Dives and Lethal Operations modes for danger seekers.</p><p>I, for one, am all about the power spikes, those cackling turnabouts where all your accumulated upgrades finally flick a brain switch from 'run away to survive' to 'run into them to kill.' I still think Vampire Survivors is more forthcoming with these moments, but DRG: Survivor 1.0 is at least more willing than previous versions to let you become a wave-wiping whirligig of bullets and plasma. Good on it.</p>

            <p>My liege, I bring more tidings from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and its Coronations DLC. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">apologising for the add-on "not being up to the standard you deserve"</a> last week, developers PDS Black have released a second patch aimed at smoothing out the edges of in-game oaths that've been causing issues.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">we reported</a> not long after Coronations arrived, it quickly turned into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">another instance</a> of Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">rather stepping in it</a> when it comes to DLC. Negative reception was fuelled both by technical issues with the new oaths rulers can take on ascending the throne, and the fact that the publishers were charging for features that are relatively compact, but also a pretty central aspect of any kingly lifespan.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to PDS Black, it's taken them less than a week to follow up on the promise of more Coronations fixes. Taking a look at the notes for the regal strategy game's freshly-released Update 1.17.1, there certainly isn't a shortage of tweaks, with a bit of balancing and a couple of new features to boot.</p>
<p>Those new additions are "a powerful new event for coronation hosts, allowing you to use your skilled chancellor to break up a neighboring confederation or earn a new vassal or tributary", plus some extra reasons for lovers to be in relationships. I assume the latter includes lines like 'his crown's got like seventy jewels, how sexy's that!' Meanwhile, balancing-wise, zealous characters are now easier to convert to witchcraft assuming their faith's OK with it. The Level six Millet Storage yurt also costs more to build, and "the ‘Divine Marriage’ tenet now has the incestuous trait as a virtue". Say what you want about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, its patch notes are rarely boring.</p>
<p>The rest of the bug fixes include, but aren't limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Consolidate the empire/kingdom’ oath: The requirement now fully checks for the title for which the coronation was held, not the current primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed the requirement for the children having a claim on your primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed decision display issues, fixed wrong law displayed in the selection tooltip.</li>
<li>‘Repent’ oath: One pilgrimage is no longer counted as multiple</li>
<li>Removed the requirements for the oath buildings and replaced them with piety/prestige costs</li>
<li>Character Memories about Coronations are now more reliable</li>
<li>The event ‘Fulfilled Oath’ will no longer display "Consolidate the None" upon completing the Reconquer Oath</li>
<li>Forbid Pope and other Heads of Faith from bringing any demands in the ‘Petitioners’ event chain</li>
<li>Upon losing the last Kingdom title, all active oaths are removed, thus preventing a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>‘Install Claimants’ Oath: The decision now properly requires 3+ claimants installed via wars.</li>
<li>Building Oaths now better display the requirements for buildings in held baronies</li>
<li>‘Shape the Realm’ Oath now has an updated building requirement in the decision window</li>
<li>‘Strengthen the House’ Oath now is fully mechanically resolved upon completion</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/573767838266819604?l=english">the full notes here</a>, sire. This patch should hopefully stop you from instantly forgetting they exist or being distracted by some Popely demand.</p>

<p>Regardless, the mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/261?tab=description">Godhome</a> by Cuckson, whose name I'm going to try not to read anything into. They've developed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> boss scene loader, which does what it says on the tin, letting you hop into any big baddie scrap the game has to offer at any time.</p>
<p>They claim that your progress shouldn't be affected, but also warned that the work-in-progress mod "could corrupt your save data" and recommend you use a 100%ed save they've included in the zip file. "While this mod is loaded, no data will be saved, to prevent corruption or loss of progress in case of using on a main save," Cuckson continued. "If you would like to enable saving, please first disable or remove this mod from your plugins folder."</p><p>Once the mod's loaded, the B key on your keyboard should open up a dedicated menu of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">different boss fights</a> you can load straight into, from the Savage Beastfly to Chef Lugoli. You'll be dropped at "the closest point to the boss that can be achieved purely through scene loading", which the modder says is often right next to them, and get straight on with the battle. There's also an option from the menu to load up a "safe zone", where you can do a bit of prep or recuperate in between battles.</p>

<p>It looks like if you've already completed a run through Skong, you'll essentially be able to live in the boss loader menu, warping around to whichever battle you want to face, which in my book makes this a bit different to the existing teleportation mods for the game. The main ones are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/156?tab=description">Bonfire Teleport</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent, which are more focused around making getting around in a conventional Silksong run a lot more convenient in terms of respawns and fast travelling between the established benches. There's also '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/104">Boss retry menu</a>' from Pilout, which lets you retry a specific boss battle right away if you perish during it.</p>
<p>If you want to give Godhome a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with configuration manager</a> framework or head to <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">GitHub</a> if you're not using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d">64-bit Windows</a>. In other recent Silksong news, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">released its second patch into Steam beta yesterday</a>.</p>

            <p>
Many moons ago, I missed my chance to join a weekly Twilight Imperium play session. Missed my chance, or dodged a bullet? Twilight Imperium is an infamously complicated and backstabby boardgame, the kind of baroque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space opera that can swallow up entire days and expose any number of terrible character flaws along the way.</p>
<p>Thank goodness there's now a PC version in the works for Steam, which will at least remove the need to set up the pieces and remember what they do. Here's a trailer.

<p>
It's being adapted by Red Square Games, the Kraków, Poland-based creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slavicpunk-oldtimer">SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</a>. If you've never come across Twilight Imperium before, the gist is that the galactic emperor has popped their clogs and 17 factions are vying to claim the throne.</p><p>"Will you dominate through raw military might, control the Galactic Council with persuasive politics, or outmaneuver rivals with secret objectives and clever deals?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/">asks the Steam page</a>. Me, I'll be pledging fealty immediately to whoever has possession of planet Crisp Bowl.
</p>
<p>
The Steam version is based on the boardgame's fourth edition, and will feature animated 3D tactical space battles. But the better news, I think, is that there will be interactive tutorials and tooltips. Even better, it also supports singleplayer. I don't envy anybody developing AI leaders for a game like this. The multiplayer features include online matchmaking, hotseat, and asynchronous play.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet. If you can't wait - and your index fingers and eyeballs are up to the strain - you can play Twilight Imperium in Tabletop Simulator. Back in 2015, Paul Dean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tabletop-simulator-mods-copyright">interviewed a bunch of tabletop game creators</a> about how they feel about TTS and its copyright-infringing mods.

            <p>It's been long enough since I last played an Ace Combat game that I can remember only two things about Ace Combat. 1) This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXB1W8va3eg">Ace Combat 7 cutscene</a> featuring what appears to be a wavy JPEG of a dog, which the Twitterati all thought was an exasperated animator's joke, but which I understand is <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Cossette%27s_dog">actually a homage to a real staff member's dog</a> who died before the game's release. And 2) you can 'powerslide' by wilfully initiating a stall, which I think might actually be a move from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-haw-10">Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</a>.</p>
<p>Delivery Must Complete sort of builds a whole subgenre around the thrill of powersliding planes. How does it do this? The clue is that "DMC" is also an abbreviation of "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>". Here's a trailer. I promise you there will be no further confusing/upsetting references to dogs.</p><!--more-->

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/">The Steam page</a> calls it "a high speed Acelike Roguelike with SSSTYLE", featuring cell-shaded, upgradeable jet fighters, four procedural locations, and an enemy roster that includes blimps, dragons and mechs. The story blurb suggests that your overall goal is to make a delivery. What's the return postage cost for an exploded Sidewinder these days?</p><p>In Delivery Must Complete, you will: parry missiles, fire bouncy projectiles out of railguns, deal with varying cloud cover, boggle at fantastical terrain flourishes such as floating islands, build a style meter, and call in orbital strikes. You will not: have limited ammo, though you do have to worry about overheating.

<p>It's the work of Melbourne, Australia-based developer and <a href="https://yoyoyollie.itch.io/">gamejam enthusiast</a> Yoyoyollie. There's no release date yet. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ae2501maeth.bsky.social/post/3lyybxmphtc2o">ae2501maeth</a> for noticing. I've been in the mood for a firmly non-simulatory flight sim for a while and this looks like just the thing, though I do have to flag up its mystifying shortage of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">brewing mechanics</a>.</p>
