            <p>I reckon you're likely to be in one of two camps with precision <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bauhaus-bonk">Bauhaus Bonk</a> - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word "bopping" -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.</p>
<p>There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness">Reefer Madness</a> extra.</p>

<p>"Spin to win in this single-player one-button dexterity game. Can you set a new time record? Complete the level using the fewest spins possible? Secure the global high score? Alternate which pivot-point you’re rotating around to move through 54 levels. Switch the background color to make obstacles disappear. Collect power-ups to speed up, slow down, shapeshift, or phase through obstacles.Reach the goal without hitting a wall"....</p><p>…is all the information we're getting, says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948330/Bauhaus_Bonk/">Steam</a>. How minimalist of you, Bauhaus Bonk. How…unification of individual artistic visions with principles of mass production and an emphasis on function of you, Bauhaus Bonk. No, <em>you </em>just read the Wikipedia page on the Bauhaus movement. Leave me alone. I describe headshots for a living.</p>
<p>Speaking of headshots: Bauhaus Bonk nails some aspects I feel are absolutely crucial - and often overlooked - in games aiming for a similar sense of arcadey snackability. Firstly, when you fail, it absolutely hits like a failure - your spinny stick shattering into myriad pieces. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, you're thrown right back into the restart before you've even really had a chance to process it all. You are thus doomed to play once again, perhaps forever. Bauhaus Bonk is out February 6th, 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
