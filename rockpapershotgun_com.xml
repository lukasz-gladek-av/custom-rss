            <p>
The original 256GB LCD version of Valve's Steam Deck is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/">20% off till 1st December</a>, knocking it down to around $319.20 or £279.20 in the UK. It's all part of this year's Blackening of Friday, whereby whimpering price tags are shoved partway into sausage machines for the benefit of the first Xmas shoppers. 
</p>
<p>
"That's a chunk of cheddar," whistled our new editorial director Julian, a choice of words I choose to take literally, mostly because he's just ruined my sausage machine analogy. According to the UK's Office of National Statistics, cheddar was 873p a kilogram as of January 2025, the last recorded figure. Assuming that average holds true, the Steam Deck is currently worth 32 kilograms of classic farmhouse cheese. That <em>is</em> a chunk of cheddar. Good work, Julian! This is why they handed you the big boss trousers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I'm vegan, so I'm totally unswayed by all these dairy-based overtures, but even if I were one of you lactose junkies, I still wouldn't get a Steam Deck at 20% off. James loaned me one of his a year or so ago, and I was quite impressed by its ability to let me play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> lying down, but my PC gaming is half-and-half MK and controller. I already own a Switch, which has maybe a third of the best PC action-platformers on it already, and I've found that Steam Deck sucks for quintessentially desktop genres like real-time strategy. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible that this is a misapprehension born of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">lingering, amorous hatred for Mech Engineer's demo</a>, and that I'm missing out on a golden age of tightly optimised controller-native harvester raids and flanking actions. I look forward to your outraged comments in defence of portable Starcraft.</p><p>Yes, I know I can get a wireless mouse and keyboard, but if I'm going to round the thing out with accessories, why not just splurge on a basic gaming laptop with a better screen that can be used for a bunch of other things? Yes, I know you can output to your TV, but I've banished my TV to a wardrobe because the power "button" broke, and I've lost the remote. Hello, TV manufacturers! Please can you put proper fucking buttons on TVs again. A single, brittle plastic tab hidden inside the frame is not adequate for my needs.  
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope you'll join me in firmly rejecting Valve's cut-price Steam Deck. Think of all the cheddar you'll be able to buy with the cash you've saved, you stinky whey-fancier. Alternatively, you could put your cheese money towards the purchase of a Steam Deck OLED - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">I hear they're decent</a> - or one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve's many forthcoming new gizmos</a>.</p>
<p>If you do insist on buying an original Steam Deck, I recommend reading James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck academy hub</a> (as advertised in the header), which encompasses how-to guides, accessory roundups, and game-specific performance and settings overviews. Perhaps if enough of you read that piece, James will feel magnaminous and lend me one of his again, so that I can finish being angry and frustrated at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>.

            <p>
Saudi Arabia's conquest of the games industry continues apace, but whoops, the country's Public Investment Fund appear to be running out of money. In the sense of being reportedly down to a mere pocketful of billions, anyway. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">New York Times</a> (paywall), via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reported-to-be-limiting-new-investments-as-cash-runs-low">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a number of the PIF's investment projects are in "financial distress", and the organisation's representatives have allegedly told international investors that they're "unable to allocate" further funds for the near future. The NYT report that the PIF's total investments are worth around $1 trillion, of which a fair chunk have no public valuation and as such, would be difficult to sell off.
</p>
<p>
The PIF disagree with this assessment, naturally. PIF spokesperson Marwan Bakrali has told the newspaper that they still have $60 billion in cash and "similar financial instruments". I'm interested to see the exact ratio of hard cash to "similar financial instrument" here. My personal wealth at the minute is about 30% <del>scrumped</del> foraged apples, but I'm pretty sure the apples are of no interest to the student loan debt collectors. This is probably not a useful comparison, unless the PIF also have major investments in the oranges trade.
</p>
<p>
This is the same Public Investment Fund that recently linked arms with Jared Kushner and Silver Lake in order to launch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">a $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts</a>, yes. According to the NYT, none of the PIF's videogame industry investments are in trouble, but the aforesaid Saudi-led consortium did buy EA using $20 billion of borrowed money, purportedly to be recuperated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">coaxing a windfall</a> (not of oranges) from the groaning magic money tree that is generative AI. That deal is slated to close in the first quarter of the 2027 financial year.
</p><p>
The PIF's videogame investments go far beyond EA. They have stakes in Nintendo, Capcom, Nexon, Call of Duty and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> publishers Activision-Blizzard, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publishers Take-Two Interactive. They've also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">sunk a lot of money into esports</a>, alongside regular sports. All of this apparently forms part of an attempt to diversify the Kingdom's hitherto oil-dependent economy.
</p>
<p>
I dislike and fear the PIF's control of studios like BioWare mostly because it's operated by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">a regime</a> that has journalists, gay people and migrant workers abused, dispossessed or murdered. But it also doesn't seem great that an increasing share of videogame developers are being consolidated under the banner of a group that appears to be having financial difficulties. One of the "distressed" projects mentioned in the NYT article is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neom">Neom</a> (pictured above), a planned city that has necessitated the eviction of thousands of local tribespeople, some of them on pain of execution, and has an estimated overall cost of $8.8 trillion.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> is set to be turned into a live-action TV series on FX, something Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx">reportedly let slip</a> back in August, but has now been <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7sST77RTZF7s9GKsxETUy4/far-cry-tv-series-ordered-by-fx.">formally announced</a> by the publisher in a post that's yet to be randomly zapped into the ether.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The series is set to be co-created by Alien: Earth director Noah Hawley and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney, now going by Rob Mac. Streaming on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally, each season of the show will be its own standalone actiony shindig just like a fresh Far Cry game, with a new setting and cast of characters.</p>
<p>So, probably your usual Far Cry affair of touring the world in search of civil wars or strife revolving around one bloke who's very good at making evil speeches. It's a formula that I've enjoyed plenty over the years, even if the last couple of entries have failed to really light my shrubbery on fire as well as Far Cries 2 and 3 did back in the day. Or maybe it'll gop for something a bit like caveman-filled spin-off Primal or 80s homage Blood Dragon, just to spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>"What I love about the ‘Far Cry’ game franchise is it’s an anthology," Hawley said. "Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of ‘Fargo’ (another show he worked on for FX) is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p><p>Mac, who'll star and produce, added that Ubisoft have been "remarkably generous" and that he's keen to work with Hawley. It's worth noting that Mac and Ubi have previously collabed Apple TV+ series Mythic Quest, in which the actor played the creative director of an MMORPG alongside prolific game voice actress Ashly Burch.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for me to finally dig that 2008 Uwe Boll-directed Far Cry movie out and see if it lives up to its <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1219216-far_cry">reputation</a>.</p>
