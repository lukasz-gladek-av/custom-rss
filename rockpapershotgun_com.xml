            <p>
Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull And Bones</a>. All this less than two months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">jettisoning</a> the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 "As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site," reads a statement sent to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-185-layoffs-as-it-closes-former-dj-hero-studio-and-downsizes-others/">VGC</a>. "Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft are currently in rather dire straits. Their share price fell precipitously last year, thanks in part to mixed reactions to Star Wars Outlaws. Earlier this month, their executive board <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">announced</a> that they were not only delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to boost its chances, but "[appointing] leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In short, they might be about to sell the company off.
</p>
<p>
It's claimed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">Bloomberg</a> that the company's founding Guillemot brothers and Chinese publishers Tencent - both minority stakeholders - are trying to found a new venture of some kind made up of Ubisoft corporate assets.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Leamington used to be FreeStyleGames, founded in 2002 by former Rare and Codemasters developers. They made break-dancing sim B-Boy for the PSP. Activision bought them in 2008 and put them to work on various music games, including the well-regarded DJ Hero in 2009 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> Live in 2015. Amid declining interest in peripheral-based rhythm games, Activision cut FreeStyle back and eventually sold them to Ubisoft in 2017. Since then, they've worked alongside Newcastle-based Ubisoft Reflections as a support studio.
</p><p>
Other Ubisoft developers have been paying tribute to the team on social media, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a> narrative director Lauren Stone. "If you liked the Classified Assignments, the Leamington Spa team led that feature," she <a href="https://x.com/laurenistone/status/1883914722195694027">wrote</a>. "It was a pleasure to work with them, and I consider this a huge loss. They were some of my favorite collaborators. I hope they find safe harbors soon to set anchor."
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to everybody affected by all this, in Leamington, Newcastle, Düsseldorf, Stockholm and elsewhere.

            <p>Look up, planet-lubber. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a> launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's the new top speed you can travel in this sandbox sequel, we're told. And you don't even need a ship to reach it. Step into the vacuum to discover your boosty backpack will send your little spaceman flyin', so you can catch up to any drifting vessels.</p>

<p>The other new stuff so far includes a fancier graphics engine, a more stable camera while you're wandering on space rocks, undo and redo functions, and the ability to make "blueprints" for quick modular gizmo duplication. Not to mention an improved grid for the block-building system (in short: big, medium, and small blocks now snap together more intuitively).</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> slowly dug itself a deep well of features over its own years-long journey through early access. It's one of our reader's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-space-games-of-all-time">best space games</a>. That means developers Keen will be playing a bit of "content catch-up". Their <a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2/#current">development roadmap</a> shows a few plans. They're going to add planets, multiplayer, NPCs, a story mode, and a bunch of other stuff, they say. Although the road map doesn't say exactly when each new shipment of goodies is planned to arrive.</p>
<p>Regardless, I have today strapped myself in to watch the various tutorials and briefing videos Keen Software have been steadily drip-feeding us, like zero-gravity lab rodents. There's a smattering posted on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419466">news feed on Steam</a>. I'll need them. The committee for space antics at RPS has appointed me meteor-explorer-in-chief, and requested a timely review of what this game is like to play so far. I travel in ill-fated footsteps. Not because the previous game was bad - far from it. But because a four-person crew of our finest wayfarers once shot off into that inky frontier and reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-diary-part-one-wolves">descended into space madness</a> over the course of a few months, culminating in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-and-betrayal-aboard-a-vast-steel-space-spider">a terrible disaster</a>. </p>
<p>I'm sure I'll be fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-1">enjoyed quite a bit</a>. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release</a>. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise Of The Ronin</a> this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>"An open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>set in the Bakumatsu period," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/">Steam page</a>, "where players take on the role of a ronin forging their own destiny. The game features multiple possible endings, allowing players to choose which faction to support—such as the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces—which significantly alters the story's outcome."</p>
<p>Here's some exclusive PC-only bits:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>8K resolution support</li>
<li>DirectX 12 Ultimate support</li>
<li>Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility</li>
<li>120fps support</li>
<li>Ray tracing support</li>
<li>3D audio support</li>
<li>Customisable keyboard and mouse controls</li>
<li>AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support</li>
<li>UI menu with mouse click ability</li>
<li>Intel XeSS graphics technology support</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Rise Of The Ronin had a decent reception on release. It's currently sitting at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/rise-of-the-ronin/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5">76 on Metacritic</a>, if that means anything to you. It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG hybrid featuring the typically deep combat you'd expect from Team Ninja. "Hardcore action for the mainstream," reckoned our siblings-in-Ziff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Eurogamer</a>. "It's more grounded than you might expect, all while evolving the Ki-based mechanics first employed in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> for a wider audience".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
