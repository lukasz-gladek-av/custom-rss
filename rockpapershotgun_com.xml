            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> modders have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">a lot of sexual stuff</a> so far. As it turns out, the game's director is cool with that, though he is hoping that despite the game not having any official tools, modders'll have a go at creating fresh wrinkles that add to what the Stellar Blade experience offers.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim gave his opinion on where the game's modding scene is currently at in a recent interview with South Korean site <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-director-doesnt-plan-to-police-modders-but-would-like-them-to-be-mature-and-stay-within-reason-with-what-they-make/">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1934199332787679533">Genki</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the director's general view on Stellar Blade modding's pretty positive. He doesn't see the need to interfere with them except by encouraging folks from being careful with or avoiding stuff that could mess up their base game. Exactly the kind of view you'd hope a developer would have, rather than panicking and calling the lawyers the moment someone figures out how to replace a texture.</p>
<p>He's also cool with the idea of folks making reams of NSFW stuff like nice suits for the game, since Stellar Blade has a strong rating and is therefore aimed at adults. I'd caveat that as adults you might find a bit weird, but I digress. To be clear you can do the dirty to whatever floats your boat, as long as it's not doing any harm. The trouble with Stellar Blade has been misogynistic players and online dicks treating Eve, jiggle physics et al, as an example of how all women should look in games - see some of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/reviews/?browsefilter=funny&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the director's less of a fan of paid mods that charge high prices, but generally seems to trust players not to engage with anything that crosses a line or involve material that could be classed as harmful or sensitive.</p>
<p>All of that said, Kim is keen to see Stellar Blade modders spread their wings a bit. While acknowledging that the game's lack of official tools will likely make this more difficult, the director's interested in seeing folks make mods that switch up what it's like to play the game, but without straying too far from its original vision.</p>
<p>According to Genki's translation, that wish was accompanied by Kim using the killer phrase "modders' firepower is still weak", as part of suggesting that he thinks the current crop of new cosmetics and minor tweaks don't go much beyond the stuff the base game offers. Which, to be fair, is the norm for games that haven't been out on PC long.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to see if the SteamyBladers accept this challenge, put aside their jiggle physics manipulation for a second, open up new tabs that cover their pretty out there desktop backgrounds, and set about pushing the limits of modding potential rather than the limits of taste. You can do it, high-five Stellar Blade modde...actually, you know what, maybe not. I don't know where that mitt's been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
