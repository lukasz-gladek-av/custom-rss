            <p>Last April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers Larian announced that they were working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>, neither of which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dd-makers-also-want-a-baldurs-gate-4-but-say-they-wont-rush-to-a-sequel-it-shouldnt-take-25-years-mind">Baldur's Gate 4</a>. Now, fresh from the labour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees">pumping BG3 full of bees</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke has shared a little more about how Belgium's finest mindflayer-wranglers are organising development of these mystery projects. </p><!--more-->
<p>The idea is that one will spin out of pre-production just as the other completes production, avoiding the familiar problem where lots of animators, modellers and other staff have to sit around aimlessly fondling D20s, while management and the Ideas People work on the direction and schedule. Instead, production staff will work on one game while the other is in pre-production, reducing downtime. Vincke acknowledges that the odds of pulling this transition off flawlessly are low. "In practice, we will probably be miserable," he says, "and there's going to be plenty of stuff that went wrong." Words to live by.</p>
<p>All that's from an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9">Gamespot</a>, as passed on by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/larian-boss-swen-vincke-says-the-studio-is-deep-in-the-trenches-on-its-crazy-ambitious-follow-up-to-baldurs-gate-3-hopes-to-show-it-off-no-later-than-2030-because-my-wife-will-divorce-me-if-it-takes-longer/">PCGamer</a>. Vincke described the first of Larian's two new things as both "crazy-ambitious" and "shaping up quite well, actually". But he added that working on the first new game alongside the second, later project is "not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players."</p>
<p>Still, Vincke thinks it's worth doing to avoid the stop-start pre-production/production issue. "When that very large group is finished," commented Vincke, "and the people at the beginning are not ready, then everybody is fucked, because everybody has to wait. That's what we're trying to avoid."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have around 470 people on staff as of 2024, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">currently operate seven studios</a> around the world. While the craven backlog-expanders amongst you may focus on the prospect of Larian releasing games at a faster rate, Vincke hopes that one outcome of running projects in parallel will be less ambiguity and a better quality of life for the developers.</p>
<p>"I hope I can tell you five years from now: We cracked it. We figured it out," he said. "This is what we're doing now. Here's game one, we're making this completely different thing. Game two, and when game two is going to be ready, we already have another thing that's gonna come. If we can make that work in a really good way, that we enjoy our lives, that's gonna be mission accomplished."</p>
<p>What could Larian's undisclosed somethings be? The boring smart money says that one of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-definitely-return-to-the-divinity-series-at-some-point-after-baldurs-gate-3">Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Still, "crazy-ambitious" covers a lot of ground. Perhaps they're making an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you play as a large body of water or the concept of Wednesdays. Perhaps they're conjuring a whole, actually new genre of fantasy - something the marketing people can't summarise by cramming "punk" onto the end of a familiar word and acting like they've just discovered penicillin.  </p>

            <p>A long time ago in, well, this galaxy, actually, Quantic Dream announced that they were making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, a cinematic adventure from the High Jedi era in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dreams-star-wars-game-isnt-dead-but-anyone-can-die-in-it">everybody can die</a>. Alice Bee (RPS in peace) poured soothing oil over the flames of hype by saying it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-let-how-cool-the-star-wars-eclipse-trailer-is-trick-you-this-game-will-not-be-good">probably going to be rubbish</a>, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">reports of abusive working conditions</a>. NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired Quantic Dream in 2022</a>. Then, nothing was shown for many years. The world froze in anticipation like Han Solo doing jazz hands through carbonite.</p>
<p>Now, finally, some news, albeit the unofficial kind. Leaked concept artworks and pitching documents have shown off a few of the new game's races.</p><!--more-->
<p>As discovered on a now-removed portfolio, and originally reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-star-wars-eclipse-concept-art-leak">MP1st</a>, the WIP and/or prototype images include shots of a Zenezian, a Rodian, and a Gungan. There are some characters who are described as smugglers, and a couple of possible character names: "Travis" and "Jotraaaz Kammzzzek", which suggests that Eclipse will walk an <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>-style path around the brainfarts of George Lucas naming conventions. One of the smugglers has a big white beard and a selection of slit visors. It's sort of Geordi La Forge trying to dress as Santa, but it's already Xmas eve and the only shop left open sells lumberjack supplies.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that many Star Wars races are extremely dodgy caricatures of non-white people, despite efforts to tidy away the stinker characterisations of the Phantom Menace era, and Quantic Dream are the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heavy-rain-detroit-become-human-and-beyond-two-souls-coming-to-pc">"a monstrously clumsy allegory for racism"</a>. I'm not sure I'd trust them with the Gungans.</p>
<p>There's still no release date for Eclipse. Earlier this year, Quantic Dream vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse commented that "one of the amazing things about working with NetEase is that they're not imposing release dates on us". I imagine another thing they're thankful for is that NetEase have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">so far spared Quantic Dream from any layoffs</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">wider cost-cutting</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hello and good New Week to ye, traveller! And my, my - what a New Week it is. We're taking the desperate toil of feeding the Maw to strange new places. I'll spell that out in a separate post to come, once I've caught up on emails during my absence last week and in general, remembered how to do my job, but you may already notice certain sinister adjustments to the format. I welcome any feedback and wanton abuse. In the meantime, here are some new PC games. </p>
<p>It's a quieter one, after Obliviongate last week, but there are some standouts. Monday 28th April brings the programmable robot block building of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2613890/Icaria/">Icaria</a> - the kind of game I enjoy hearing about but will never muster the neurones to play. Tuesday 29th April? I will delicately avoid Tuesday 29th because Tuesdays are overrated and it's high time somebody said it. Nothing useful, beautiful or truthful ever happens on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th April is a day of meaty tribulations, thanks to Slavic manko-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moroi">Moroi</a>... and of joyful spacecat salvation, thanks to immersive sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. On Thursday 1st May, another unusual pairing: Ecuadorian slice-of-life soccer adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, and Lovecraftian house mystery <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-horror-at-highrook">The Horror At Highrook</a>. And on Friday 2nd May, it's time for no-roles naval MOBA <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/">Sirocco</a>. I haven't played an actual, undiluted MOBA in years. This one has galleons, which might be enough to reel me in.</p>
<p>What's on the news agenda this week? Probably a fair bit more about the Oblivion remaster, which is exasperating young people who haven't quite clocked that it's still an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from 2006, with none of the modcons you'd expect from, I don't know, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. We'll also be taking a closer look at Skin Deep and The Horror At Highrook. Beyond that, I've got my eternally uncleansable backlog of interview-based features to pick at. Seen a game or topic we should cover? Please avail yourself of our comments thread below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
