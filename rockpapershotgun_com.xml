I think there might be a chance, just ever so slightly, that the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities Skylines 2</a> has been a bit difficult. The game launched back in October of 2023 and has suffered from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a>, and a delay to its first expansion Bridges and Ports. This expansion was meant to come soon after the Beach Properties DLC, but that obviously didn't happen, catching a delay to sometime in the second quarter of 2025 specifically to continue improving upon the base game. Except the expansion has been delayed once again.
</p>

<p>
Over on a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">forum post</a>, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/colossalorder">Colossal Order</a> shared an update explaining why the DLC has caught another delay. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, weâ€™ve received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
This, they say, left them with "a difficult choice: delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short." Colossal also said they think Bridges and Ports is enjoyable as is, but to "bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time." Now, it's expected to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, a free update is coming on June 11th that was meant to coincide with the expansion that includes a couple of new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays. It's something! To be fair to Colossal, delaying it probably is the better decision, I could quite easily see another botched DLC sinking that city builder shaped ship. 
</p>
<p>
I think there was some famous guy who had a plumber for a son that once said something like "a delayed Bridges and Ports expansion is eventually good, but a rushed Bridges and Ports expansion is forever bad." Might be paraphrasing.

        <p>I've convinced myself the whole thing is an elaborate prank</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> isn't a real game, right? I mean, I'm sure it is a real game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-producers-next-game-mindseye-has-a-release-date-though-im-not-sure-if-youll-find-it-everywhere">it's meant to be coming out June 10th</a>, that's only two weeks away now, and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies is helming it. It just doesn't feel like a real game. Take for instance the fact that the game's latest trailer, which was released today, is its first proper gameplay trailer. There's been a few teasers over the past few weeks, but absolutely zero extended looks at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. That's weird for a game due out in two weeks!
</p>

<p>
Plus there's just the game's whole vibe. The UI isn't awful, it just feels like the kind of thing you'd see in maybe the game's first trailer, but then you watch a video titled "All Of The Differences Between MindsEye's First And Second Trailer" and see how it's improved. The gameplay itself looks like something you'd see in a TV show that made a fake video game to have a character play for an episode, there's a CPR rhythm-mini-game for heaven's sake, what's going on here? Are we back in 2009?

Everything about the narration of the dialogue is generic, wishy-washy nonsense too. They just feel like words to fill a space. Sure, there's some explanations for what you can do in the game, I just don't feel like I've been given a single reason to care. The whole thing just feels like a way to spend a lot of money.
</p>
<p>
There's also user generated content that can be built off of MindsEye, the trailer boldly saying that the game is the "home of infinite entertainment", a very bold claim considering it still needs people to make stuff in it first.
</p>
<p>
MindsEye just has the vibe of someone asking a 12 year old what their perfect game would be despite not knowing a lick of what makes anything good or interesting in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The trailer did also provide a roadmap for future updates, which include a couple of "special" collaborations, more missions, multiplayer, that kind of thing. Nothing that makes me think MindsEye will become a real game, but hey, maybe this thing's the next Fortnite. Probably not.
