            <p>
Sometimes, the world you live in sucks. It is a place filled with despair, and misery, and blood, guts, and death. This is much the case with the world of Mörk Borg, an apocalyptic fantasy TTRPG where you have no sense of hope, only dread, that is now also a video game. This video game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mork-borg-heresy-supreme">Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme</a>, is more of an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, though its tabletop routes are still to be found, and it is as mean as it is darkly enchanting.
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it very much takes after its original book form, using only black, white, yellow and red for its colour scheme (you can guess what the red is used for). In the demo version of the game there is only one class to choose from, whose stats and starting weapon are randomly generated. Though, you can just re-roll infinitely until you get something you've happy with, an ability I hope is limited in the full release.

<p>
To start, you are tasked with finding a troll finger. You set out into the world, this miserable little world, on a 2D plane, your only directional options being left or right. When you finally meet enemies, you can slash at them with your weapon, be it a femur, a knife, or a scimitar you pick up after slicing a skeleton in half. There's a dodging mechanic, you both consume items for health or lob them at your opponents for damage, this starting class can also kick or block with a shield. It is laborious in a way that teeters on the edge of being insufferable, though I expect it'll fall right off for some.
</p><p>
Everything is slow, some of it perhaps a bit too much so, yet there's a method to the madness. You don't have much health, so timing a block or a dodge and a slash at just the right time is important. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> comparisons are all but guaranteed to be made in future reviews. I died quite quickly, of course, this game is tough and cares not for your happiness. Dying almost seems like it's the point, especially with its lightly procedurally generated world.
</p>
<p>
The RPGness of it all comes in the occasional dice roll, a digital D20 randomly deciding your fate, your character's attributes assisting or impeding said rolls. Levelling up comes at set points apparently, with some skills improving, others worsening. It is a player hostile game, one that begs for you to challenge it, and that'll be a boon for many, and a curse for many more.
</p>
<p>
It's too early for me to say whether I like the thing or not, but I can say I'll be curious to give it another look whenever it does come out. In the meantime, you can check out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216800/MRK_BORG_Heresy_Supreme/">here</a>.

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Soon after it launched in 2019, Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-disappears-from-steam-after-pooh-review-bombing">pulled from sale</a> following some controversy regarding Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie The Pooh (long story). It was made available for purchase again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">a couple of years later</a>, though it should have been a touch earlier than that as it was promised to be released on GOG late 2020. However, on the same day it was announced to be returning, GOG put out a statement saying they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-back-down-from-re-releasing-devotion">wouldn't be releasing it after all</a>. Now, half a decade on from that, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflects on the decision to not put it up for sale, after it stood by selling the also controversial Horses.
</p>
<p>
"That situation remains difficult to reflect on," Gołębiewski told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-reflects-on-devotion-delisting">Eurogamer</a> in an interview. "At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us."
</p>
<p>
Gołębiewski went on to say that in order to keep a "global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility." 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to a game like Horses, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">banned from sale on Steam supposedly over an outdated scene</a>, he feels that the situation was different, saying that its sale on GOG didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners. There was no other concern driving this decision, just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."
</p><p>
I am not entirely convinced by his reasoning, I have to say. GOG explained that they were pulling Devotion from sale at the time <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817">like so</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Of course, this might have just been the public reason presented at the time, and Gołębiewski is now telling the true version of events, but I find it a bit tough to believe that they hadn't considered the potential business and geopolitical factors up to that point (the game was nearly two years old by this point). Still, better to have at least one storefront that willingly releases games with difficult themes occasionally than not at all, I suppose.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">Roguelike</a> deckbuilders! They're everywhere! It's a bit of an epidemic, honestly, sorting the wheat from chaff is a tough job. Of course, once in a while a genuinely novel take on the genre rolls around, and PinKeep has done just that, a pinball game where you change the playfield as you progress through runs. And it's from the devs behind the Far series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a>!
</p>
<p>
The pinball element is likely self explanatory. There's a ball, it gets shot off, and you have two flippers to hit it with, nothing new there. It's everything else around it that'll have you thinking about the beautiful game (in this world the beautiful game is pinball). Runs are split up into different themed stages, and it's up to you to add elements to the main playing field.
</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PinKeep | Demo Launch Trailer | OUT NOW!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuBkEa1HFFE?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
So, for example, say you want a bumper somewhere on the field to propel your ball along, you choose from the cards you've collected, and place it at various fixed points. You can rotate such structures to your liking, but to play these cards you need to spend money. To get money, you need to use your ball to destroy trees and rocks. Then you collect resources from these destroyed elements of nature, selling them to merchants at the top of the screen, of which you get to by flinging your ball successfully towards them.
</p><p>
This is further complicated by enemies slowly progressing towards your town of operations, and if they manage to reach you, you lose a bit of health. You'd think hitting enemies would be as much a bit of luck as it is skill, but you also have the ability to slow down time and flick your ball anytime you like, allowing you to line it up just so to take down an enemy combatant.
</p>
<p>
All this took some getting used to, with the fast-paced nature of pinball mixed with slowing down to plot out where you want being an interesting tactical exercise. The thing is, I just don't think you can go wrong with pinball, but the way you can build upon it here makes it much more strategic. Take the aforementioned bumper you can add in. It comes with the added effect of a little goblin that sits on top of it who shoots out arrows at incoming arrows if you hit said bumper.
</p>
<p>
When you build up your field just right there's a nice harmony to it all. I do wonder if adding in changes to the slow motion flick or the flippers themselves would add something or overcomplicate things, but as it is in its current demo, PinKeep is heading in the right direction. You can try it out for yourself, or just wishlist it, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700">here</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was never a game that was going to win me over, as I generally only like single-player shooters if any, but it isn't helped by the fact that since its announcement there hasn't been a lick of actual marketing to help it prove itself. This, of course, has been the subject of much discourse, to which I will contribute slightly in the coming paragraphs, but the main point of all this is to say that actually, against all odds, Highguard is in fact sticking to its January 26th launch date, and will even show off some gameplay… on its release day.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a singular Dweet on the game's Dwitter account, explaining the following: "Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase. Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more." You'll note Devolver Digital being its usual cheeky self in the replies asking if the devs need a publisher; "There's still time."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Now, I don't care to be marketed to, excessively, moderately, or conservatively, the last of which is still generous in Highguard's case. It's just I can't tell if releasing a game after one trailer is an act of supreme hubris, well-placed confidence, or riding on the assumption that it being from the creators of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. I have to wonder if developer Wildlight Entertainment thought that such a pedigree was enough in this pre-established property-led world we live in.
</p>
<p>
Highguard might have some old guard talent, but we don't live in the same world as film, plastering names over trailers of other games doesn't suggest guaranteed quality, it invites comparison. Games have to prove themselves in the pudding, and so far on most counts Highguard hasn't done a very good job of that. The only benefit it currently has is all of this technically bad (absent) PR might make enough people curious enough to play it, and it is free so that's easy enough to do. Guess we'll find out in a week or so!
