There should have been two major extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> launching in the last quarter of this year. One of them is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, which is in fact coming out later this month. The other is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">you know</a>. Interestingly, though, with both games hosting tests earlier in the year, there was an opportunity for Arc Raiders' developers to learn something from Marathon.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said how it was "very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."
</p>
<p>
In particular, Watkins notes how the Arc Raiders team was able to gauge how people responded to the pair of extraction shooters' differing takes on the genre. "[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours," he explained.
</p>
<p>
It is worth pointing out that Watkins said he hasn't been deeply inspecting the game or anything, only a select few have been able to play Marathon. Bungie's shooter is obviously in troubled waters currently, but Watkins is curious to see what becomes of it, saying he "[found] the art style very evocative … I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future."
</p><p>
Arc Raiders held its final playtest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">over the weekend</a> and it seems to have gone quite well, so I myself am curious to see whether the full release will be the one to bring extraction shooters out of its deep niche well. Marathon is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">set to hold another test this week</a>, but this one is under NDA, so don't necessarily expect to hear anything about it (even if you can probably bet on someone breaking said NDA for Reddit karma or whatever the kids are into these days).

            <p>
Though I deeply wish for it to not be the case, unfortunately the reality you and I find ourselves in is one where AI is being forced into every single crevice the worst corporations you know can fit it in to. It hasn't completely dominated any of the arts just yet, but its usage is becoming more and more common. If you're one such developer considering doing so, voluntarily, I would normally offer you some potentially unkind words, but instead I'll point you towards the one and only Nobuo Uematsu, whose stance on AI is one I'm quite fond of.
</p>
<p>
The iconic Final Fantasy composer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html">JARSAC Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-says-hes-never-used-generative-ai-and-never-will-hardship-is-what-makes-the-creative-process-rewarding/">Automaton</a>), talking about his time in the games industry, and notably how he feels about AI. "I’ve never used AI and probably never will," Uematsu explained. "I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself. When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though. 
</p>
<p>
"Even when it comes to live performances, music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections."
</p>
<p>
This, my friends, is the only reasonable response to AI. There really is an inherent value in the process of making something, it lets you discover something unexpected in the thing you're making that putting in a short prompt could never let you experience. Have a bad time making things once in a while! This is Uematsu we're talking about here, he knows a thing or two about this art thing.
</p><p>
It's also worth noting that the composer announced last year that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasys-legendary-composer-nobuo-uematsu-doesnt-have-the-strength-to-score-a-full-video-game-again">likely won't be producing a full video game score again</a>, even if he does plan to keep making music in general (including writing the Final Fantasy games' main themes). I bring this up as he specifically mentioned not having the physical or mental strength to do so anymore. Accessibility is often touted as a reason why AI is good, but even here Uematsu shows that it's still possible to make things even when there are limitations to what and how much you can produce.
