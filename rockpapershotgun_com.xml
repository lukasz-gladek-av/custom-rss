            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s second patch is here ahead of an impeding full release, with Team Cherry having shared the notes and initiated Steam beta testing. No balancing tweaks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">this time around</a>, just a bunch more handy bug fixes that're well worth being aware of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're getting close to finalising the second post-release patch for Hollow Knight: Silksong," the studio wrote in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">post on Steam</a>. "Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools." They added that if you do opt to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">test it out via the beta branch</a>, you should "expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release".</p>
<p>As for the tweaks made thus far, you'll find 'em laid out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from Disgraced Chef Lugoli sometimes just deciding he's done with Hornet and nopeing out never to be seen again mid-fight, the one that's caught my eye is the death sequences messing up if you expire the moment you deal a fatal blow to a big baddie. Surely that's a) pretty tough to pull off and b) something that should offer a unique outcome. I'd say the boss' expiration going sideways in some hilarious fashion would count for the latter.</p><p>So, here's hoping Team Cherry add in a less troublesome bug to ensure anyone who pulls off the double death still get a quirky reward to ease their pain. Anyway, I'll stop waffling, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked really hard on.</p>
