Square Enix have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to the genteel 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-pc-review">hailed</a> as... "a bit of a slog"?? "A big old anticlimax"??? I thought it was quite good!</p>
<p>This is an outrage! I'm going to tell Katharine she sucks at writing and is terrible at video games. What do you mean, she doesn't work here any more? Well in that case, I'm going to tell Graham he should never have hired her. What do you mean, he doesn't work here any more? Who <em>does</em> work here any more? Oh screw it, just roll the trailer.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> Nought takes place in the first game's Orsterra, a medieval fantasy confection with a few Steam Age flourishes, and sports the same "HD-2D" visual direction - a calculatingly throwback  blend of chintzy sprites and lushly illuminated 3D environments, much like a grandfather clock equipped with a wifi speaker.</p>
<p>It brings back the first game's battle system, which saw you Breaking (aka, staggering) enemies by filling a bar, and spending Boost points to enhance actions performed in each turn. Characters still get unique Path Actions when interacting with townsfolk, too. 
</p>
<p>
So where does it differ? Well, you can now customise your protagonist and rebuild your very own hometown, Wishvale, after somebody inconsiderately burns it down in the prologue. It's not yet clear how this might affect the rest of the game, but I imagine you'll be able to shop in Wishvale and give your party members places to live. It's what I'd do, if I were Enix, Esquire.
</p>
<p>
Octopath Traveler Nada launches on December 4th this year. That dirty, no-good Katharine also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the second game</a> before she left us languishing in the arms of Ian Games. She remained unimpressed, concluding that "bar a couple of very minor evolutions, this is effectively the same Octopath Traveler as before". I confess, the first game's story does drag on, but I greatly enjoyed the alchemy of the Boost and Break systems. I do think Square Enix have run the HD-2D look into the ground at this point, though.

            <p>Some people don't like cockroaches. I've always found them to be reliable mounts for the tiny gnome army via which I'll one day conquer the world. Anyway, forget I wrote that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates">come out this week</a>, and as such folks have fired up their modding machines and got to work tweaking the garden survival extravaganza to their liking.</p>
<p>Let's see here, we've got some of the usual useful changes, texture swaps, and...ah. A mod designed to help folks who're afraid of cockroaches. It'll do just that, provided you're not also terrified of clowns, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-red-soldier-ant-egg-location">bugs</a> vaguely dressed like them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm starting off with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/20">this roach mod</a>, put together by gallant Arthurian knight/modder Sir_galahad172. They've had a good idea. Save the folks with phobias by arranging the cockroach equivalent of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-arachnophobia-mode-spider-differences">arachnophobia mode</a> the game has to change eight-legged enemies into something less spidery.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though. At first, I just saw the party hats and painted eyes they've given the roaches and thought oh, ok, they must be going for a Saturday night under the floorboards sort of vibe. Then I clocked the goofy shoes on each spindly limb and the red nose. Putting two and two together, this has to be a roach clown. Is it clowny enough to go off the deep end in the other direction and give nightmares to folks who can't sit through IT? I'm not sure, but you get a mixed review of your valiant attempt at making people un-scared, Sir Galahad.</p>
<p>To cut them some slack, I can throughly appreciate the fact they've swapped the SCAB scanner for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/15">Pip-Boy</a>, in some Xbox brand synergy so synergistic Phil Spencer's probably just had to reach for the tissues. Ditto their spooky, scary skeletonising of the player character.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, they're not the only one at it. There are bunch of tweaks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/8">stack size</a> (all the way up to 999 if you want), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/9">difficulty</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/13">player stats</a> from modder Caites. You can also chuck in a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/14">hasty port of an item spawner</a> for the first game and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grounded2/mods/10">Mod Organiser 2 support</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, aside from the roach clown, it's close to what you'd expect for most big-ish games that've recently debuted on PC. We'll have to see if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 has the insect legs to outdo the fairly titchy total of 144 mods planted in its predecessor's backyard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-modding-kicks-off-with-cockroaches-dressed-as-clowns-which-is-good-for-bugphobes-so-long-as-they-arent-also-circusphobes]]></content:encoded>
