I don't know if I'm allowed to write "dad I'd like to" you know what, even as an acronym, so I won't, but my current prediction for Scholar, the first of two new Nightfarers coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as part of its Forsaken Hollows DLC, is that this is what an alarmingly large number of people will refer to him as. I get it! He's a bit grubby looking, but he's smart because he reads books and stuff. There's multitudes there.
</p>
<p>
Goofs and gafs aside, how about we take a look at what he actually does. According to the DLC's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows">official website</a>, the Scholar boasts "impressive arcane levels" and can gain "incredible advantages through battlefield observation." I'm not exactly sure how this translates in-game, but there is one moment where he sort of scans a group of enemies that appear to be causing some trouble, after which they seemingly get easier to takedown.

Another spell, used during a boss fight against some clones of the player characters, seemingly links both you and your comrades to one another, but also the enemies to one another. After that, when one of the enemies gets killed, the other two die at the same time, so my guess is that there's a trade-off in that if one of you gets downed, so do the other two. He also has a sword! Seemingly nothing fancy about that particular fact, it looks like he uses it almost like a fencer does, but there's really not much more to say than that.
</p><p>
He is one of two new classes coming with the DLC, the other being the Undertaker, who is yet to receive a trailer herself. The Forsaken Hollows also brings with it two more bosses to face off against, as well as additional shifting earth and a mysterious "more." I'm sure that'll all be revealed soon enough, given that it's due out next week, December 4th.

            <p>
To say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> hasn't had an easy go of it would perhaps be a mild understatement, though that's not to say it's entirely undeserved. There was that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">absolutely silly hat malarky</a> for one, creating a not particularly welcoming vibe, and there was of course some controversy involving the pricing for some of its in-game items. All of that unfortunately led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-their-hat-and-pricing-controversies-splitgate-2-studio-1047-games-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-devs">two rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-devs-1047-games-lay-off-more-staff-as-the-shooter-heads-back-to-beta-eyeing-a-2026-rerelease">layoffs</a>, and a switch back to a beta version of the game. Now, it looks like it'll be back in action next month.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096">very brief post over on Steam</a>, developer 1047 Games shared that the Splitgate 2 beta will be ending next week, December 4th, "with relaunch coming later in December." If you're taking part in said beta test, they also noted that the beta season and active battle passes will be ending, as well as your seasonal rank progress, so keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
No specifics were shared about when that launch may happen, but they did say they are "excited to share more soon," and December is right around the corner, so you probably won't have to wait long.
</p>
<p>
I haven't tried out Splitgate 2 for myself, so I can't comment on how it seems to be shaping up, though in a separate, recent blog post related to this recent playtest, 1047 did outline some of the changes they've made since the beta started. 
</p><p>
This includes simple things like bug fixes and optimizations to bigger jobbies like new maps and weapons, removing factions, and bringing back a number of different modes. According to the devs the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is in "the best place it's ever been," but I suppose the masses will find out if that's true soon enough!
