            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZOI</a> kind of looks like an exercise in pushing the uncanny valley to me, something I'd wholeheartedly respect if that were definitely the intention behind the game, but I have a hunch that it really is just meant to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but if it looked like real life. Whether that's enough to win over Sims lovers or not, I'm not sure, its early access release isn't until next week so we'll all know more then. However! You do now have the opportunity to try and test the limits of its character creator, as like a few games have done in recent years, its Create a Zoi feature is available to download as its own thingâ€¦ if you're happy to do a bit of homework.

<p>
In order to get a code for the inZOI: Creative Studio, you'll need to watch someone play the game on Twitch, SOOP, Chzzk, or through a livestream on the official inZOI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">Steam page</a>. They all have <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8324">different requirements</a>, mind - on Twitch and Chzzk, you need to make sure you have your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/krafton">Krafton</a> ID linked to whichever streaming service you're watching on, have inZOI in your Steam wishlist, and watch someone play the game for at least 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can just watch the stream on Steam for 30 minutes to get a key. 
</p>
<p>
I can't tell you how to watch it on SOOP because Krafton didn't explain how, and it's a Korean streaming service, and they don't seem to have posted what to do on their English socials, so honestly if you're desperate you should probably just watch someone on Twitch.
</p>
<p>
It's not just the Create a Zoi feature you'll have access too, as a Build Studio mode will be included too. This one lets you have a fiddle with building different rooms. It's not the full package, obviously, but seems like a good demo to check out if your greatest passion in The Sims is making Sims and building houses, but aren't sold on those features in inZOI just yet. Personally, the Zois scare me, so I'll leave it to you to try it out.
