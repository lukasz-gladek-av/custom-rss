            <p>In their first set of financial results since <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/control-studio-remedy-issues-profit-warning-due-to-weak-sales-of-fbc-firebreak/">issuing a profit warning</a> and switching CEOs earlier this month, Remedy have revealed that they're moving resources away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> amid a "sense of urgency", and aiming to rely on established series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Control delivering hits which'll shore up their commercial fortunes in the long-term.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In these <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf">latest financial results</a>, Remedy reported a loss of €16.4 million between July and September 2025, in contrast to the €2.4 million profit it made the same time last year, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> had been out of the door less than a year. Remedy co-founder Markus Mäki - who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-after-nine-years">stepped into the role of interim CEO</a> last week, replacing former CEO Tero Virtala not long after Firebreak's sales disappointment - says his job's been "to raise the bar and the sense of urgency across the organization, and to drive stronger results".</p>
<p>So, given Firebreak's sales have only gone up "marginally" as the studio have delivered updates, they're unsurprisingly shifting chess pieces elsewhere. "We continue working on features which enhance player value, and which are justified by our updated long-term sales expectations," the results doc reads. "We have moved development resources to our other in-development titles while respecting our communicated roadmap for FBC: Firebreak."</p>
<p>As for what the studio are banking on to arrest their number slumpage, Mäki says they plan on making big hit games that people like. More concretely, he indicated Remedy's focus in the short-term and until 2030 is mainly to lean on their established series, Alan Wake and Control, to keep growing and deliver these hits. Though, the fact the studio'll be "carefully balancing our product risk" with the need to create "new experiences" suggests future spin-offs being relied on as hits probably won't be as big a leaps into the unknown as Firebreak was, being Remedy's first crack at multiplayer.</p><p>For now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> being developed alongside Rockstar remain in the works. There's also an unnamed new project listed as being in the proof of concept stages at Remedy. Given the emphasis on their plan to rely on Control and Alan Wake, as well as need to stick to proveable hits, it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to imagine it could be something Wake-ish. Don't quote me on that though, we'll have to wait and see whenever this mysterious thing's revealed.</p>
