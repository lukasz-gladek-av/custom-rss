            <p>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</a> came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-modder-is-beautifying-marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-with-cel-shaded-visuals">began work on an overhaul</a> that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. </p>

<p>They're calling the mod "Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite And Beyond". Worth noting that Buzz Lightyear is not a character within either universe but we'll let that go. The trailer above shows off a lot of thick black outlines, halftone effects, and a flash of Venom as he dons a cute baby blue symbiote. You can also catch a glimpse of an alternate costume for Spider-Man - the get-up of British quipster Spider-Punk, who appeared in the most recent animated webslinger flick Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. Cool.</p>
<p>We spy some of those new arenas too, which we're told are "nods" to stages previously used in the series. I don't play a whole heap of MvC, so I only recognise the wireframe training room from Street Fighter. Please don't take my biff 'em up badge. I worked so hard for it.</p><p>You'll be able to grab the mod on <a href="https://www.mvcib.com/">the team's website</a> when it launches on December 20th, the creators say. "This was a labor of love from nearly 40 people over 8 months of work," said Maximillian Dood, a streamer who commissioned the principal modder to continue work on the mod after <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1785829442780274830">catching wind of it back in May</a>.</p>
<p>So there you go. It's a neat overhaul. The cel-shaded style is used well to evoke manga and anime in the Arc System Works fighting games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, so it makes perfect sense to me that an MvC game would look swish when done in a similar style.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In October of this year, we got a look at some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-trailer-for-mass-effect-wannabe-exodus-features-space-capable-flesh-cathedral-whisperingly-described-by-matthew-mcconaughey">icky celestial faction</a> and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? <em>Now</em> we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.</p>

<p>What can we glean from it? It shares a similar over-the-shoulder look to Mass Effect, with a special "celestial tech" granting you the ability to freeze enemies, before shattering them into shards of charcoal. There's a pretty planet covered in sickly fog and a fight with an armoured space bear. The key to beating the bear is to bash it in the head. There is also an inquisitive frog in a vat of water, as well as a larger frog who is more menacing.</p><p>On a more serious note, this "celestial tech" seems to be the crux of the combat. Allowing you to turn your arm into a temporary energy blade, while your offhand provides the grappling hook goodness to flank or reposition. The protag's gun also morphs, transforming from a shotgun in the first bit, into a grenade launcher later and rifle later on. I'm unsure how exactly your pals help you out in the more explosive moments or whether you can direct them, as they're not really the focal point of this trailer. You do see them do a bit of shooting and a bit of stealthing, though.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a sense for the writing off only the shortest snippets, but from a general vibe sort of view, I think it looks like a 7/10 special. Not that this is a bad thing at all! 7/10 games are some of the very best, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There's no release date on Exodus yet, but you can follow the game over on its <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US">official site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">the recently added Illuminate faction</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

If you've not played Killzone, it used to be Sony's silver bullet in the battle against Halo, Gears and Call of Duty for control of shooterdom. It's a natural choice of licensing partner for Helldivers, being a series about a pseudo-World-War clash between intergalactic space empires, one of which was briefly ruled by Logan Roy. 
</p><p>
I was nuts about Killzone 2, which released in 2009 and was one of the first "big" games I ever reviewed. It was notorious for an E3 2005 trailer featuring pre-rendered footage made to look like real-time gameplay. In practice, it proved to be a perfectly OK FPS with thunderous grimdark set-dressing and a mildly confuzzling first-person cover system. The mainline sequels Killzone 3 and Shadowfall are straightforward examples of the law of diminishing returns, with spin-offs Mercenary and Liberation being respectable handheld shooters. They're all exclusive to Sony consoles, so this Helldivers 2 crossover is, I guess, Killzone's formal debut on PC. Hmm, I should put that in the headline.
</p>
<p>
The Helldivers X Killzone goodies form "a new tier of special Premium content" on the Superstore. There's been some blowback from the diver community about both the pricing and the fact of selling primary weapons as DLC. The second part of the crossover deal arrives on 23rd December, and then there are those hints in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491">the Steam announcement blog</a> about "an additional Killzone 2 reward for all Helldivers depending on your success in the Galactic War". 
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">any number of crossover collaborations</a> in mind for Helldivers 2. For a time, they envisaged a system that would effectively let individual Helldivers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world">hallucinate licensed worlds</a>, with map cosmetics that are invisible to their non-buyer comrades. I'm not wildly excited to see Killzone's militaristic trappings in action once again, but one Killgadget I'd love Helldivers 2 to implement is Killzone 2's open-roofed infantry dropships. Check them out in the aforesaid E3 2005 trailer, below. Now, imagine riding one of those to the surface of Vindemaitarix Prime.

Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rally-point">Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming</a>. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

<p>
For starters, that introductory analogy is from the wrong millennium. Times Of Progress is set during the Industrial Revolution - the dawn of steam engines, trade unions and high-density urban housing. The first thing that grabs you about it is the presentation and aesthetic. We are in procedurally generated Isometric Land, with roads and railways binding together diamond-shaped town layouts. The buildings, terrain types and overall colour scheme are pleasantly clean - pale earth, red brick, green hill - but it isn't barren. There are some engrossing animated flourishes such as smoke plumes, and the way houses slowly fatten up into more complex dwellings.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, you might be tempted to call Times Of Progress "minimalist". It definitely seems more condensed than a lot of city-builders, but there are systems aplenty, including a few that spring more directly from the choice of period.
</p>
<p>
Take scientific innovations and new technologies, such as typewriters, water frames or electrolysis. You don't simply assign scientists to research them yourself. Rather, they unlock according to a timeline as part of the wider Industrial Revolution, which encompasses your city and all the other, AI-governed cities on the map. You then spend points earned by meeting certain goals (like achieving a certain food output) to import new technologies and get access to them faster. In general, trade appears to be a big deal in Times Of Progress. There isn't a military element, and seemingly no distinct "culture" layer either, so your interactions with other metropoli will be mostly mercantile.
</p><p>
There's also the question of labour politics. Workers in Times Of Progress may go on strike if a certain percentage in a certain place of work haven't been paid (in the form of food) for several weeks. You can meet their demands or implement a police crackdown. Workers may also unionise, once you pass the associated laws, making them more expensive but more efficient. Those with university educations may be more likely to strike.
</p>
<p>
I like the balance Times Of Progress seems to be striking between the joy of building a model trainset and a carefully considered degree of historical fiddliness. I suspect/hope that Sin will be along in the new year to write something more elaborate about the game. Please look kindly upon my fumbling early efforts, Sin! For the moment, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628450/Times_of_Progress/">you can read more about Times Of Progress on Steam</a>. The developer Pressing Thumbs Games is a solo operator, based in Berlin, who uses the Rust programming language and the Bevy Engine. The studio's name apparently comes from the German equivalent for crossing your fingers to ensure good luck. Awww.
