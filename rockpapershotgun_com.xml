            <p>The developers of hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.</p>

<p>Blizzard explained the ins and outs of Classic mode in <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">a rose-tinty post</a>. They also explain that this won't be the only time the mode appears (Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, likes to run limited-time events often). Each time the classic event shows up it will replicate the "heroes and balance from popular moments in the game’s history."</p>
<p>This time that means you can have a team composition of six Torbjorns, the turret-thwacking Swede. Or field a team made entirely of very annoying Genjis, the ninja who I hate. But be warned, this lack of hero limits only lasts the first few days, say Blizzard. "After that, we will enable single hero limits for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event." </p><p>Some things won't be changing, though. The maps that cycle through this mode will be the maps you recognise (Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and so on) but their design will remain as they appear in Overwatch 2. "This includes major reworks for Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar," say the devs.</p>
<p>The mode will run for the next three weeks, until December 2nd. And it's not related, we're told, to the chin-scratching at the studio regarding another possible 6v6 mode in Overwatch 2. That's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-may-get-6v6-again-as-blizzard-try-to-bring-back-the-chaotic-over-the-top-variety-of-the-first-game">something separate the studio is thinking about</a>. </p>
<p>Blizzard aren't the first to encourage players to become misty-eyed about a shooter they used to play. Last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-season-og-brought-back-its-original-map-last-week-and-a-record-breaking-44m-players-came-with-it">its old map</a>, resulting in record player numbers and likely catching the dollar-sign eyes of every executive in charge of a live service game. But harking back to some "golden age" of your favourite online blastabout is a questionable way to engage with nostalgia, as James learned when he had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> after they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">launched a similar classic mode</a>. As a a kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> holiday it was enjoyable, he said, "but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always <em>that</em> good."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed". As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>, that's an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>. They're suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game's</a> servers, rendering it unplayable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft pulled the ol’ snippy Johnson on The Crew’s server wires <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">back in March</a>, effectively killing the online-only game. The following month, it started <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">disappearing from owner's</a> Ubisoft Connect libraries. In response, YouTuber Ross Scott started a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Stop Killing Games</a> initiative, petitioning France's Directorate General For Competition, Consumer Affairs And Fraud Protection (DGCCRF) to investigate.</p>
<p>Ubisoft - perhaps rightly terrified of a protracted skirmish with a man who owns two first names - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">confirmed an offline mode in September</a> for sequels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>. The Crew itself, however, remains unplayable. As Polygon note, Ubisoft did offer full refunds to those who had "recently" bought The Crew when they first announced the server shutdown, but since the game came out in 2011, this excluded many.</p>

<p>The lawsuit itself takes the above pinball allusion and runs with it, saying this chillingly paddle-deprived thought experiment is "exactly" what happened with the game’s server shutdowns. Both plaintiffs own physical copies, which the lawsuit says they wouldn’t have bought "on the same terms" (price) knowing the servers could be shuttered, rendering the game unplayable. The lawsuit also cites, among others, several of Ubisoft’s titles that have shut down servers but patched in an offline mode, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> and 3. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p><p>In October, Graham wrote about an update to Steam that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">warns customers at checkout</a> that they're only buying a digital license to a game. The change, implemented internationally, was in response to new California legislation designed to more clearly inform players that a digital purchase doesn’t necessarily equate to permanent ownership. GOG, who are themselves exempt from the legislation because of their DRM-free offerings, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">couldn’t resist a cheeky pop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers who remade <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> are working on a new roguelite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> shooter. It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-point">Rogue Point</a> the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth. Which is where your team of renegade shooterists come in. They don't want to win this contest, they just want everyone else to lose.</p>

<p>Lots of Rainbow Six style a-breachin' and a-clearin' going on in that trailer there. We see blast charges, silencers, and one player using a big handheld battering ram to bust down a door while another tosses what's probably a flashbang over the threshold. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Steam page</a> calls it "high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning" with "tough, unyielding enemies". </p>
<p>It also says maps will be "reshaped" with every playthrough by something called a "Parametric Design System". Big word, that, parametric. Luckily, I am immune to big words. It is a fancy way of saying the maps (a mall, an office, etc) will feature some amount of randomness. But whether that's enemies, layout, objects - or something else - we're not told. Whatever it is, they promise variety, which will be important if we're to be SWATing it through dangerous corridors. Imagine checking the same corner twice, yuck.</p><p>It sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready Or Not</a>, a hardcore tactical co-op shooter that's all about storming rooms full of bad guys with hostages and the like. The multplayer shooter is an interesting route for Crowbar Collective to go following their recreation of Black Mesa, but it also makes some sense, given that the reworked weaponry animations were a big strength of Gordon's Great Gallivant, an adventure Graham called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-review-2">"the most impressive fan game ever made"</a>. Personally, I need a little more than "co-op roguelite shooter" to get excited about guns. But different strokes for militant folks and all that.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is being published by Team 17 and has a loose early access release date of 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time.1033098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – which is like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> but better in almost every way – is getting a new, if potentially more smudge-susceptible Limited Edition. A successor to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-out-now-and-ready-to-ship-immediately">translucent version</a> that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The white-and-grey makeover will set you back £599 / $679 / €719, so it’s a few notes more than the 1TB Steam Deck OLED it’s functionally identical to. But you would get the <em>exclusive</em> ability to protect your Deck from thieves by camouflaging it against a stack of printer paper, or to pair it more effectively with a boat-ready pair of summer chinos. It’s bundled with a white carrying case, too.</p>

<p>All the same, I’m probably not gonna go for this. Besides being perfectly happy with my bog-standard, goth-shaded Steam Deck OLED, I’d immediately develop a deep paranoia over marks, scuffs, and melted chocolate stains blemishing that pristine exterior. But if you’re the sort that thinks all consumer electronics should look like the iPod, it’s there, albeit temporarily. Limited means limited in this case, and once the initial round of stock sells out, it’s gone forever. Better be ready at 3pm PST / 11pm GMT on the 18th to grab one when they launch.</p><p>If you do end up missing out, take comfort in knowing that a successful Limited Edition White could lead to more vibrant Steam Deck recolours in the future. “We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line,” said Valve comms chief Kaci Aitchison Boyle in a statement.</p>

<p>Said missive also confirmed that Valve are involved with "ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">other hardware plans</a>", though you can probably expect new colours for the existing models before a full-on Steam Deck 2. That’s still not coming for some time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-wont-sacrifice-battery-life-to-deliver-a-more-powerful-steam-deck-2">according to Valve’s engineers</a>, who want to “wait for a generational leap” in computing performance before committing to a whole new handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
