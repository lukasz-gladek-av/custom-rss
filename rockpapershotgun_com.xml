            <p>Lo, when we perform the great ritual to open the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta, the cheaters will come. That's what Activision said a few days ago, more or less. Hark, friends and foes enveloped in tactical gear and the occasional goofy crossover skin, it's now a few days later and the cheatening is upon us. It arrived with the beta going live, just as prophesised.</p>

</p></div>
<p>Cue posts like the one above, from helpless souls caught in the frothing swirl of the cheatening maelstrom. And cue responses from Activision's powerful anti-cheat druids, writing of these foretold ritual side-effects things like: "This clip was from earlier today. The account was already banned."</p>
<p>The bearded warders against the likes of wallhacks and aimbotting have even broken out a powerful magical artefact, the hammer emoji of reassurance, in their responses to clips like this, a number of which went viral on the tweeter last night. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/">Reddit</a>, as a far as I can tell, looks relatively free of such clippage or anger about cheating, which is a sign of the end times if I've ever seen one.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's at this point that Activision would want us all to take solace in their prediction from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">this blog post</a> a few days ago, AKA the prophecy I paraphrased earlier. "Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta," it read. "Thatâ€™s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear. Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> to future releases."</p><p>Obviously, this isn't an affliction unique to Call of Duty. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">James eloquently outlined when Battlefield 6's beta was similarly afflicted by cheating</a>, despite both it and Blops 7 seeing studios take the extra step of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">making it mandatory for PC players to enable secure boot</a> in an effort to curb tech-savvy tricksters. The debate is whether continuing to take more and more measures like that in an effort to whack whatever persistent cheating moles keep popping up or slipping through the array of defenses already assembled is worth any inconvenience caused to those playing fairly as a result.</p>
<p>It's a delicate balance to strike, and where you stand on the issue may well depend on just how many cheaters you've happened to run into in online games over the years and the situations in which those encounters happened.  In Black Ops 7's case, there's also arguably a little bit of irony in Activion's strong stance, due to the ability to temporarily see and shoot foes through several layers of wall, a bit like some cheats allow you to do permanently, actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-call-of-dutys-war-on-cheating-black-ops-7-says-ehh-whatever-heres-a-wallhack-esque-killstreak">being in the game as a killstreak reward</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I await Black Ops 7's full release on November 14th, at which point I prophesise that the cheating chatter will emerge once more. That's provided the round of cheat chatter prompted by Battlefield 6's arrival on October 10th has actually managed to dissipate by mid-November.</p>

            <p>Ok, so if you're one of those high-vis types who can be driven up the wall by health and safety code violations, you might want to look away. Crashout Crew, a co-op chaos-generator all about forklifts, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> co-developers Aggro Crab, with sights set on a 2026 release preceded by a Steam demo this month.</p>
<p>I told you to look away, high-vis types! Why are you already running to management with a written demand that all heavy machinery can't be drifted around at top speed and slammed into boxes?</p>

<p>Anyway, forget about them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a> looks like a great laugh. You can up to four mates are strapped into forklifts that can boost and drift, with the mission of grabbing various good strewn around a warehouse, and pushing a big red button to jet them off on the right conveyor belts. Failure to do so results in quotas not being hit, and presumably a telling off. As you progress, you can add extra quirks or wrinkles to the action via safety violations, much like in real life.</p><p>"After the recent cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-under">Going Under</a> 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development," Aggro Crab wrote of how it came to be. "While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew!"</p>
<p>A full release in 2026 is being aimed for, but ahead of that Crashout Crew'll be getting a demo on October 13th, as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest. You'll be able to give the first three levels a go and see if the chaos offered is up to snuff.</p>
<p>Aggro Crab have also made clear that Peak, the co-opper based around going for hikes up big hills developed by themselves and Landfall Games, will still be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-wants-you-to-waste-your-time-on-silly-things-like-basketball-and-chess-in-its-latest-climbing-averse-update">getting updates</a>. The studio plan to dual wield goofy creations in their quest to ensure that every being on Earth must have at least one chuckle with their colleagues while playing a video game.</p>
<p>It's a noble cause, and also a formula that's yielded Peak a considerable amount of success so far. So, let's see if doubling down will rocket Aggro Crab's forklift to even greater heights.</p>
