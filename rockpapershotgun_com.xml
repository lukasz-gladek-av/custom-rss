Remember how it felt in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> when you discovered a <a href="https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Wooden+Shield">shield</a> and learned that it existed purely to shame and humiliate returning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players who are over-reliant on blocking? Do you remember reading those awful, judging, fourth-wall-besmirching words, “Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity”? Well, The Knightling is the opposite of that feeling. It’s a bouncy, breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> platformer in which you are a novice chevalier equipped with a circular, gear-toothed shield he uses for absolutely everything. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can slide down hills on it! You can hurl it like Captain America! Like hurling his shield, I mean, not like hurling Captain America. You can use it as a parachute! You can even parry and block with it, though that feels like copping out. Not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">The Brew Barons</a> have I witnessed such commitment to a bit. If you’re similarly enthused, you’ll be delighted to hear that developers Twirlbound and publisher Saber Interactive have just slapped a release date on the thing - 28th August. Here’s a trailer.

The story here is that you’re searching for your mentor, a famous knight called Sir Lionstone, who’s gone AWOL while a-questing in the realm of Clesseia. That’s his shield you’re doing doughnuts with. It’s made of Callyrium, which sounds like a Ratchet &amp; Clank version of Vibranium. Is the shield upgradeable in the manner of most video game weapons? I’m not sure, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">the Steam page</a> does mention upgrades of some kind.
</p>
<p>
The trailer announcement accompanies an updated demo. It expands the previous demo’s Outskirt area to include ”the seldom-visited, secluded woods in the far corner of the realm known as the Cornered Bosk.” Somebody should get FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki to play that demo and ask him if he still thinks shields “engender passivity”. Let’s see you surf through a meadow on an effing Moonlight Greatsword, Miyazaki. Let’s see you turn a Kirkhammer into a glider.

            <p>
It's been a billion years since I played a proper new Front Mission game, and I'm depressed to learn that Square Enix cancelled one in 2022. Titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape and developed by BlackJack Studio, it was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/04/front-mission-2089-borderscape-announced-for-ios-android">announced</a> for release on iOS and Android but, who knows, might have clanked and rumbled onto PC, the place all good mobile games go when they die. Alas, Square Enix shut the project down a few months after reveal. Now, they're suing BlackJack for releasing a new game that allegedly makes use of leftover parts from the Front Mission contract.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, BlackJack Studio released a game called Metal Storm, or Mecharashi, in October 2024. Square Enix claim that BlackJack (known in the lawsuit as HK Ten Tree) developed it "using materials created pursuant" to their old Front Mission licensing agreement for Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
Mecharashi was only ever released in China and Japan, but does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">an English language Steam page</a>, which describes it as a "mecha-themed tactical turn-based game" that uses "a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle." The trailer certainly looks rather Front Missionary. Square Enix have sent a bunch of DMCA takedowns to get the game yanked from storefronts. It's back on Steam as of this writing thanks to a counter-claim.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix's lawsuit has been filed in both a US and a Japanese court, and includes side-by-side comparisons of Mecharashi and the unreleased Front Mission 2089: Borderscape - 11 pages of them. Find some examples below. 
</p>

<p>
The Final Fantasy publishers argue that the game can't be released in its current state because it makes use of "game mechanics, visual designs, and other protected content" from the abandoned Front Mission collaboration. They want BlackJack to both remove said infringing material and cough up $150,000 per infringement. 
</p>
<p>
Being neither alleged infringer nor self-described infringed-upon, I will conclude only by saying that I think those mech designs are quite nice. Softer-looking and warmer of hue than I remember Front Mission being, though that's me harkening back to the PS1 era when the science of video game anti-aliasing was in its infancy. It reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-brigade">Phantom Brigade</a>. Ah, I hope we get another tactical mech game soon, once the lawyers have had their fun.
