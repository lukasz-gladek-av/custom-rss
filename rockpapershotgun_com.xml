            <p>Open world sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beta-decay">Beta Decay</a> is being delightfully greedy. The game's retro PS1-inspired art style hides some furious ambitions. It will be a "dystopian RPG where you can build spaceships, join factions, and fight for territory in a newly discovered star system," according to the Steam blurb. The game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beta-decay-is-a-low-poly-dystopian-rpg-whose-grimy-cover-shooting-shows-promise">previous trailer</a> showed some swish (if somewhat prototypey) cover shooter combat. But the game now plans to launch into early access this year, developers Rotoscope Studios have announced. And this time they've brought the big guns, literally. Mech some time for the trailer below. </p>

<p>Ah. That is some primo PlayStation 1 polygoning. There's no tight release date for this early access shooter, just a loose "2025". The open world survivalist combat is already looking more polished, a smog-smudged peek at the factional warfare the developers are promising, which will see corpo jerks and syndicate scum clash "in an endless fight for territorial control of the Alpha Centauri star system."  </p>
<p>What this looks like in practice is a lot of diving and ducking and blasting off limbs. Miniguns, sniper rifles, thermal goggles, VTOL aircrafts, weird dudes commanding legions of insectoid horrors. What's not to like? Just look at that dithering. I could run my finger across the screen and it would feel like a tea strainer. Ah, beautiful.</p>

<p>The game also plans to include a lot of other features, going beyond the firefights we see here. There are promises of survival mechanics that require you to eat, drink, and sleep. As well as the possibility of buying and selling goods (and even stocks) in a "player-driven" economy. Not to mention the spaceship tinkering.

</p><p>"Become an engineer repairing starships, a mech pilot commanding war machines, to a syndicate leader, executing raids deep within a labyrinthic neon city," say Rotoscope. "Trade products through physical shops on the streets to digital securities on the Centauri Exchange. Build spacecraft with complex sub-systems such as power grids, server networks, and life support systems to keep your crew alive in deep space..."</p>
<p>These are big promises for what looks like a small studio. Even one of these many features would constitute an entire game's worth of work. I'm also conscious of what happened last time I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-mommy-mechs-of-the-forever-winter-are-stomping-into-early-access-next-month">expelled litres of drool</a> over an apocalyptic mech-stomped warzone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">much jankier than I'd hoped</a> (although to be fair it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winters-water-will-no-longer-drain-away-while-youre-offline">getting reliably updated</a> as its own early access continues). But never mind that. I am the mech appreciator. I live in a rusty state of eternal hope. I'll keep you informed of Beta Decay's progress.</p>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> mod that aims to recreate the entirety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s map based on "leaked" data and guesswork is no longer in development, after Rockstar parent company Take-Two had videos of the project banished from Youtube.</p>
<p>Titled Project Vice and <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1902865326804701386">released</a> to the public on 20th March, the playable GTA 6 map mock-up in question is the work of Youtuber Dark Space. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared">response video published yesterday</a>, Dark Space says Take-Two sent him a copyright removal request over his Youtube videos of the mod last week. He's now removed all download links to the mod, without any further prompting from Take-Two, and says he's no longer working on the project.</p>
<p>"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5--something purely made out of passion, not profit," reads the intro to the response video. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, Take-Two Interactive took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."</p>
<p>Dark Space has since been chatting to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">IGN</a> about this reversal, which he says wasn't unexpected (an unsympathetic soul might ask why, given that knowledge, he decided to work on it in the first place). "I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns," he said. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me." </p>
<p>Take-Two have yet to share their reasoning for the takedown request, so we're left with Dark Space's own explanation for events. The mod forms part of a loose community GTA 6 mapmaking initiative, largely operating out of Reddit, which deploys a bunch of speculation and alleged leaked information to plot out the game's geography. That said, Dark Space claims that "most" of his map is based simply on shots from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">the first GTA 6 trailer</a> from back in 2023.</p>

<p>"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he told Ian Games. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."</p>
<p>As for why he's decided to junk the whole thing despite not being commanded to by our insect overlords at Take-Two, Dark Space observed that "well they clearly do not want this project to exist. So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There's no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they're willing to allow."</p>
<p>All of this naturally makes me much more curious about Project Vice. Is this just a corporation's lawyers auto-firing at anything that smells remotely like an infringement, or is the mod, as Dark Space suggests, "a little too accurate" in its portrayal of GTA 6? I mean, it's probably the former, but please don't let my growing deficiency of wonder ruin an <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/status/1904151003290566681">emerging conspiracy theory</a>. I've dug up a bunch of screenshots of Project Vice for your eyeballs and insights.</p>

<p>All of this continues Rockstar and Take-Two's rather torrid relationship with the GTA modding scene, which has seen them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5-ai-mod-shot-down-by-take-two-even-as-rockstar-relax-policy-on-modding">recruit some modders</a> to work on the series while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">giving others the ole DMCA blunderbuss</a>. It'll be intriguing to see how things change or don't change after the release of GTA 6, given that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-let-you-modify-its-own-map-using-roblox-style-user-creation-features-claims-report">rumoured to let you modify its own map using Roblox-style features</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
