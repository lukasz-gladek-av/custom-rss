            <p>Last year, Spanish developers Tequila Works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers-tequila-cancel-game-and-lay-off-staff">cancelled a game</a>, laid off staff, and finally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tequila-works-the-studio-behind-rime-and-the-sexy-brutale-has-filed-for-insolvency">filed for insolvency</a> in the face of "prolonged market conditions", after losing funding from Tencent. Founders Ra√∫l Rubio and Luz Sancho departed the studio in the process.</p>
<p>Now, what's left of Tequila are selling off all their assets in an open auction, including both published games like horror platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlight">Deadlight</a>, and a number of projects that were either in development or "ready for production". It all makes for a sad anatomy of the studio that gave us the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rime">Rime</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684">the auction listings on Escrapalia</a>, Tequila Works had plenty on the boil. The first in-development project listed is The Ancient Mariner, "an open-world narrative action adventure, focused on human emotions as the driving force of the gameplay". Clunky elevator pitch notwithstanding, this sounds like a follow-up to Rime, in that both projects reference Coleridge's poem Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. If you've completed Rime you'll know that the poetic parallel here goes beyond the title.</p>
<p>The second project listed is Dungeon Tour, which sounds a lot more lighthearted. It's described as "a conceptual mix between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>" for up to four players. The premise is that you're guiding sightseers around procedurally generated catacombs. What if Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli had to shepherd a bunch of goofs wearing fanny packs with Goblin phrasebooks? What if Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but with a group of retirees in palm-print shirts rather than a rolling ball of fire? Yeah, I could see myself having fun with that.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's Brawler Crawler, which was to be about developing a combat style in a "chaotic urban universe" of procedurally generated streets. This is the only one of the three in-dev projects that's described as having been cancelled in the auction, so perhaps this is the game Tequila Works shelved last November.</p>
<p>Four other "unreleased video game concepts" are mentioned in the listing, each consisting of "creative, narrative and visual documentation, and reserved rights". They are Frozen Outpost, Mr. Bones, Hungry Cities, and Under A Logger's Moon.</p>
<p>The auction naturally doesn't detail the fates of Tequila Works staff following last year's bankruptcy announcement - at the time, they were expected to "fulfil their responsibilities" according to Eurogamer.es sources, despite management not necessarily having the ability to pay them. Since then, several Tequila members have posted that they're looking for new work on LinkedIn, amongst them <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jose-luis-lara-romero-761b5338_ive-been-part-of-tequila-works-for-six-and-activity-7265011388010397696-r2pi/?rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">senior sound designer Jose Luis Lara Romero</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-canela-lagunas-3522439_opentowork-ugcPost-7262144756124721153-ArhQ/?rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">senior game designer David Canela Lagunas</a>.</p>
<p>Others have posted tributes about their time working for or with Tequila. "They found me at a time when I was losing faith in my own career," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308119321564581888/">writes</a> Rob Yescombe, who was freelance narrative director and writer on Rime and VR game The Invisible Hours. "We made two wonderful games together, that have stood the test of time."</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Tequila Workers who are still looking for a new home.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in the 90s, there were essentially two kinds of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 player. Firstly, the juvenile Mussolinis who monopolised the Blue Blur himself in the callously-defined "single player" mode, and secondly, the absolute saints and/or craven appeasers who consented to be Sonic's sidekick Tails, and had to spend the whole run struggling to keep pace with the Sonic player's camera. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Tails in Sonic 2 "single player" is a grieving immortal, his soul lashed to the wheel of Sonic's whirling footsteps, doomed to respawn indefinitely until his prickly tormentor finally exhausts their shared stock of lives. Yours was an existence doled out in offscreen "du-dum" noises, as poor Tails ran half-knowingly into any spikes or Robotnik creations eclipsed by the Sonic player's passage. Yes, I'm aware there was an actual splitscreen mode, but let's be honest with ourselves, 30 years on - it made your TV look like a mitotic error.
</p>
<p>
Sonic players will look at the just-announced multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platform game</a> SpeedRunners 2: King Of Speed and see only another  checkerboard mountain of astroturf to conquer. Tails players will look at it and see an opportunity to put everything they've learned from those Mega Drive humiliations to the test. For SpeedRunners 2 is a game about a bunch of Tails players competing to be Sonic.

I apologise if I'm making too big a fuss of the SpeedRunners concept. I missed the first one, which came out in the 2010s, and which we have covered in no less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/speedrunners">five seperate feature articles</a>. In any case, the apposite comparisons here are probably Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Trials and The Flash. 
</p>
<p>
In SpeedRunners 2, up to eight superheroes sprint through 2D spy-fi levels, striving to be the last remaining character on screen. You've got base movement mechanics such as wall-kicking and a grapple hook, plus power-ups such as missiles, traps and freeze rays with which to Blue Shell the other players into screeching submission. The levels include terrain fixtures such as ceilings you can swing from and boost pads. It all looks slick, jolly and decently nail-biting.
</p>
<p>
"The original multiplayer gameplay formula of SpeedRunners is timeless, unofficially dubbed as the 'Mario Kart of 2D platformers'," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183760/SpeedRunners_2_King_of_Speed/">the Steam page</a>. "With the sequel, our goal is to carefully bring this unique 'SpeedRunners feel' into the new era without compromising on the depth and fluidity of the movement system while still keeping it easy to grasp. On top of that, King of Speed introduces vibrant high-definition graphics and improved netcode." 
</p>
<p>
The game launches later this year. Speaking as a recovering Tails player, I am reasonably stoked. The only thing the trailer seems to be missing is that little intangible margin of error around the screen in Sonic 2 - that Last Chance Saloon from which the double-tufted fox might heroically scoot back into visibility.
