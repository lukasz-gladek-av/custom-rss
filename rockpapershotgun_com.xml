            <p>The enemies of survival shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/">janky spawns</a>. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Often, the game world exists only in the player's field of view," say the developers when asked to define the feature in an <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/faq">official FAQ</a>. "A-Life 2.0 is a simulation system for life in the Zone. Factions and mutants are fighting for living space, migrating, capturing new places, or retreating to safer areas. A-Life is what makes Zone truly alive and unpredictable."</p>
<p>If that is currently present in Stalker 2, it's hard to tell. Right now, it seems enemies spawn in a simple radius around the player, for example, and you'll sometimes even see them pop into the world. If you don't see the enemy themselves as they appear, you will see the white sight marker that abruptly shows you've been instantly spotted by the bad guy who has materialised somewhere behind you. It's not the most intelligent spawning system, but I guess it does keep you on your toes. It also doesn't apply to every kind of enemy encounter - some are scripted, while other bandits and soldiers are tied to particular locations, making those run-ins appear more naturalistic. </p>
<p>Enemies do fight one another when they come into contact as well, but this more often happens after a group of bandidos or pack of blind dogs blinks into existence near an enemy camp simply because you're there. I have come across roaming groups of Stalkers, but again their appearance is sudden, and they're more likely to walk straight into toxic waste and die due to braindead pathing than to get into emergent scrapes with the wildlife. I definitely haven't seen any (non-scripted) instances of factions "capturing new places" or "retreating to safer areas" as the developer's definition suggests. </p><p>After some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/so_alife_isnt_really_in_the_game_then/">complained about the A-life system</a> being absent (and pointed out that a mention of the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/">edited out of the Steam page</a>) the developers have responded on Discord and Reddit to say that the system is really there, but that bugs are preventing it from acting as intended. </p>
<p>"There are several known issues with A-life 2.0 system that we are aware of and are working on fixes/improvements," said the studio's community manager on the Stalker Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-devs-reassure-players-yes-a-life-2-0-is-in-the-game-no-its-not-working-right-and-yes-fixes-are-on-the-way/">PC Gamer</a>). "We know that this system is very important to the Zone having an immersive atmosphere, and we will do our best to fix the known issues."</p>
<p>It doesn't help that "A-life" is (and always has been) a hand-wavey buzzword, even more vaguely defined than Battlefield's "levolution" or Call Of Duty's recent "omnimovement". This leads to confusion and mixed expectations among players about what the feature actually entails. What is also complicating things from a developer perspective, say GSC, is that two different in-game systems are responsible for creating these theoretically organic shootouts. It presumably takes tweaking both to make the world feel inhabited by competing groups who wander around. And for each bug report or complaint they receive, they need to figure out which system is responsible for the unintended behaviour.</p>
<p>"The Combat AI and A-Life 2.0 are different things," one of the developers notes in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/comment/ly8nabt/">a reply to a Reddit complaint</a>. "One is actually a 'brain' for combat scenarios, while the other is an overall and more complicated system that is trying to manage life in the Zone."</p><p>In the meantime, the first patch for the shooter is coming soon, say GSC, who recently posted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections"> details about the fixes</a> they're planning. A lot of these will address crashes, softlocks, balance adjustments, and other high-priority stuff, they say. But at the bottom of the list is "A-Life system bugfixes", which further suggests the studio considers it significant enough to sort out soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/c7ra8t/the_godemperor_by_john_blanche/">emprah</a> - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - <a href="https://youtu.be/znrCqYFFl9Q">Blanchitsu </a>- named after him.</p>
<p>Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer</a> series either. His piece <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerFantasy/comments/rtgrbg/harry_the_hammer_john_blanche_1983/">Harry The Hammer</a> was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making <a href="https://trademarkfilms.com/films/d121a6f6-231f-481d-86bc-3fe5ee83847f">a documentary</a> on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:</p>

<p>As per the title, the documentary’s narrative is set up as a hunt for the 46-year veteran of Games Workshop, which seems a little dramatic as far as narratives go: he’s <a href="https://youtu.be/NCOSao1KEQo">not exactly</a> been <a href="https://youtu.be/HnruIB54Zys">elusive since</a> he retired last year. Still, I’ve always quite enjoyed watching something I’m familiar with given an outsider-framing. It’s almost like discovering something for the first time, and I’m sure it’ll be interesting to see which details from Blanche’s long career the filmmakers consider pertinent or interesting to more general audiences.</p><p>What’s doubly exciting is that it seems like the documentary will explore further afield than Warhammer itself. In the trailer, you can see some models and artwork from Trench Crusade - a skirmish miniatures game with work from some ex-GW talent that recently did gangbusters <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1405364378/trench-crusade">on Kickstarter</a>. Even the <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1852841297469415604">Helldivers crew were impressed</a> enough to get hyped<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world"> about a crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Heder himself, according to a website blurb, was introduced to "the world of Grimdark" when out "looking for a gift for his kid". May I suggest <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrenchCrusade/comments/15noh8q/sin_eater/">this Trench Crusade lad</a> with more than a little <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> influence, Jon? As for you, reader, do try and fish a copy of <a href="https://goblinlee.blogspot.com/2019/05/ratspike-john-blanche.html">Ratspike</a> out of the internet if you’re interested in more of Blanche’s work, alongside fellow fantasy luminary Ian Miller.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You may have noticed some recent changes to our commenting system. I want to explain what has been happening.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we swapped our in-house commenting system for a third-party system. As soon as the swap was complete, complaints about poor site performance and usability problems flooded in from readers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a substantial number of you reported that your mobile devices were crashing when trying to read articles - not good.</p>
<p>We treat this sort of reader interruption with the same level of severity as a site outage, and we have been working behind the scenes with the third-party to understand and fix the problem.</p>
<p>But, sometimes the fix is to go back to what you had. So that's what we've done.</p>
<p>As of today, we are back using our old commenting system. No more infuriating "See more" buttons, no more broken notifications, and most importantly - no more crashing browsers.</p>
<p>You may notice your comments from the last two weeks aren't visible - we'll be restoring those in the coming days.</p>
<p>This, and other communities across Gamer Network sites have some of the most eloquent, funny, and insightful commenters on the internet, and we want you to stick around. That will only happen if our websites offer not just the best journalism in the world, but also provide you with the best reading experience and community tools possible. That is our goal.</p>
<p>I am really sorry about these recent changes impacting your ability to enjoy the site.</p>
<p>I'll be hanging around in the comments thread to chat if anyone has any questions, feedback, or ideas for further improvements we should make to our in-house comments system.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
