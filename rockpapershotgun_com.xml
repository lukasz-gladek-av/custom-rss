            <p>What in the name of jumping jellybeans is happening to The Maw? Our grizzled regular column summarising all the latest game news is going through some sort of midlife crisis and doesn't know what it wants to be. I can hear it grinding its molars, squelching its many news bladders, and unfurling its long, insipid tendrils. The usual Mawkeeper, Edwin, is away today, so it's up to me to soothe the beast and tell you all the new games being released on PC this week, as well as a hint for some anticipated strategy game news from Paradox Interactive.</p>

<p>I like lists. So let's do this round-up the old-fashioned way. Here's what's coming out.</p>
<h2>Yesterday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Drop Duchy</a> combines the classic tetramino dumping of Tetris with a kingdom managing tactics game. Looks neat!</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/">Best Served Cold</a> is a murder mystery visual novel set in the speakeasy of an alternative history European city (looks pretty much like the popular vision of 1920s United States). You're the bartender turning detective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Today</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Among Us 3D</a> will let you snap the necks of all your best mates and betray the trust of those you love. You cannot spell "friendship" without "end". </li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 7th</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179730/Deck_of_Haunts/">Deck Of Haunts</a> is a maniacal mansion deckbuilder where you design spooks for unsuspecting visitors.</li>

<h2>Thursday 8th</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paradox are announcing a big new game, as they've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YaZcN-eVta8">teased in a video</a>, calling it "a new era for grand strategy". Fans who have been <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-talks-61-30th-of-april-2025.1738380/">reading the developer diaries</a> for the game codenamed "Project Caesar" are certain it's a new Europa Universalis. We'll have more for you soon. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">The Midnight Walk</a> offers first-person horror with fearful doll heads and some of that not-quite-stop-motion animation all the kids love nowadays. </li>
<li>Sci-fi action adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2787320/Revenge_of_the_Savage_Planet/">Revenge Of The Savage Planet</a> continues its colourful extraterrestrial exploration with four planets to disrupt in co-op. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373090/Yes_Your_Grace_2_Snowfall/">Yes, Your Grace 2: Snowfall</a> is a follow-up to the pixel art kingdom management game that's set in a world inspired by Slavic folklore, where you "collect taxes, hire agents and make difficult decisions". </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/">Sonic Rumble</a> is a Sonic game, so I don't care. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 9th</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/">Anoxia Station</a> is a petrochemical horror strategy about slurping up pools of fuel inspired partly by Frostpunk but with its own distinctly creepy atmosphere. Edwin was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/petro-horror-strategy-game-anoxia-station-makes-frostpunk-look-positively-welcoming">intrigued by its demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>That's your lot</h2>
<p>Okay, I'm done here. As ever, let us know in the comments if there's anything happening this week that we've missed, but you've got your swivelly little eyes on. The Maw is, at least, placated. Hmmm, docile even. Although it's possible what I'm looking at is actually one of its decoy globules, and the true Maw has squeezed out of its enclosure again. I'll, uh, be right back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I have an unhealthy habit of throwing money at several solo tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> projects a year, whether or not I actually plan on playing them: tables and lists corresponding to dice rolls are one of my favourite ways to consume microfiction, and I get a real buzz out of TTRPGs as discrete creative writing artefacts, if not necessarily functioning games. Naturally, I'm all over Spindlejack - a print and play solo game set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> universe that you can download for<a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack"> free here on itch.io</a>.</p>

<p>You play as a space courier delivering packages across the Starward Belt, a role inspired by Citizen Sleeper 2's Kadet. To play, you'll need 10 six-sided dice, a pencil and eraser, and some counters. You'll be using those dice to randomly map out the intersections you travel through as you complete deliveries and upgrade your trusty airbike. Here's a big ol' setting chunklet:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the Far Spindle, in the Starward Belt, Spindlejacks are notorious. Slicing across the station with their custom airbikes, they courier messages, packages, and anything else too sensitive to be fed into the station's crumbling and haunted networks. Sharing the cavernous transit tunnels with hulking cargo haulers, they are also widely assumed to have some kind of deathwish. But, as one of their number, you know it's the rush, the competition, and the community that keeps you riding.</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll also need a printer, of course - horrific devices one and all. Not even speculative science-fiction has dared to imagine a future where one exists that doesn't make me want to break down in angry tears any time I have to use one, nor one that doesn't try to sell me italics DLC or whatever. Still, if you can brave the intricacies of a medieval torture device posing as benign office equipment, this looks like great fun. You can read Brendy's interview with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-you-guess-which-australian-tv-sci-fi-of-the-early-2000s-inspired-citizen-sleeper-2">creator Gareth Damian Martin here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
