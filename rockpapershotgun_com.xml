            <p>Birds chirp and gentle breeze floats by as you sip your tea. A tank rolls by, a shell explodes, and someone gets wiped out by machine gun fire. You remain relaxed. This is, after all, the stated goal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s freshly introduced Casual Breakthrough mode, designed for those who wish to battle fields "without the intensity of a full PvP lobby".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Casual Breakthrough's aimed at providing "a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges", EA said in their <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819">announcement of the new mode</a> over the weekend. Its matches feature smaller teams which feature 32 bot teammates/enemies outnumbering 16 real players, with each squad made up of 16 bots and eight human field battlers. Siege of Cairo and Empire State are the maps it's been applied to out of the gates.</p>
<p>While Casual Breakthrough doesn't dish out dogtags, accolades, or update your career stats, it does offer several forms of XP progression and the chance to complete challenges. To be precise, Career XP, Weapon XP, and Battle Pass XP are all on offer, with actions involving real players dishing out full XP and those involving bots only offering half.</p>
<p>That mix, coupled with the XP and challenge farming that's been an element of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> since it prone-crawled into its full release state, seems to pitch the mode as a sort of holiday retreat where folks can grind away at individual goals without having to focus as much on trying to win matches for their team. Well, at least without risking having an uber-competitive teammate shout at you. I assume there's still the risk of someone shouting at you because you're getting in the way of them leveling up their gun. We'll see how the mode fares in time in terms of living up to that purpose.</p><p>Meanwhile, in other XP-related news, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984674602006855747">EA have picked up on an "issue"</a> affecting the amount of XP being earned in Strikepoint matches. From the looks of it, another exploit that could be used to farm XP without putting in intended hard yards is the issue in question. "To maintain fair and consistent progression, we've made some temporary adjustments to XP in this mode while we investigate a longer term solution," EA wrote.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever, you respond. Jets fly overhead as you place the bits of cucumber back over your eyes and sink into your camo-liveried sun lounger.</p>
