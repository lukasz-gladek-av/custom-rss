            <p>GOG continue to conquer the world of old games you either remember fondly or have totally forgotten about. They've added 18 new ones to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> this week, with the latest arrivals being the Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0.</p>
<p>It's good to see the storefront's preservation efforts keep on expand, given they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-say-their-preservation-program-has-been-harder-than-we-thought-thanks-to-drm-and-elusive-creators">recently revaled</a> that this program's been a tougher undertaking than originally envisioned thus far. Things that're worth doing are rarely easy, though, are they? Well, ok, maybe having a cheeky biscuit with your supper is still worth doing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0's arrivals were <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983807379125702969">announced just this morning</a>, and they've been chucked straight into GOG's classic Resi bundle. In terms of tweaks to get them running as they should, both have had their stability checked, their compatibility with Windows 10 and 11 okayed, and support for cloud saves added. They're also currently grabbable with a 75% discount which knocks each down to Â£4/equivalent until November 13th.</p>
<p>The addition of those two follows 16 other games hitting the preservation program <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983175739714191850">earlier this week</a>. Tomb Raider GOTY, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-codename-47">Hitman: Codename 47</a> are the headliners to my young eye. However, you may have much stronger feelings for one or all of (clears throat):</p><p>SPORE Collection, Clive Barker's Undying, Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy, Superhero League of Hoboken, Heart of China, Thunderscape, North &amp; South, Titus The Fox: To Marrakech and Back, Battle Chess 4000, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>: Prisoner of Ice, and Bloodwych.</p>
<p>GOG say their preservation program's 250 games wide with these new additions, which is inching closer to their stated goal of around 300 to 350 by the close of 2025. I'm sad they don't publicly track a 'number of private investigators hired to track down rights holders' stat, but retaining some mystery there's understandable.</p>

            <p>
Amazon have cancelled their second attempt at a Lord Of The Rings MMO as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">recent mass layoffs</a>, according to a now-former senior gameplay engineer at Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>. I've reached out to Amazon for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable.
</p>
<p>
Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">met an unfortunate end in 2021</a> thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023</a>, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a "persistent open-world MMO adventure", spanning the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project.
</p>
<p>
"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."
</p>
<p>
It's claimed that 14,000 people are losing their jobs as part of Amazon's latest cuts. Best of luck to everybody affected. At the risk of being twee, here is an encouraging aside from the books: "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."
</p><p>
If you're desperate to roam Middle-earth in company, Standing Stone and Daybreak's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> is still trucking along with a small but steady audience, almost two decades since launch. The community's recent doings include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom">finally accomplishing a pilgrimage of desperately underlevelled hobbits to Mount Doom</a>.
