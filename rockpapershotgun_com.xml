            <p>The demimimise of Mimimi means I'm now on the lookout for my next opportunity to crouch behind a hedge, distract a man with a stone or coin, and then choke him unconscious. (And in the game.) Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream looks like a worthy candidate. Announced last year, there's now a new trailer showing the isometric (isometrish?) narrative stealth in action.

<p>The story sounds a bit Plague Tale-like: Hanna has awoken after a long illness when her brother Herman promptly goes missing. Hanna sets off to find him, with two other playable protagonists, Alva and Sebastian, helping on the journey. That seems to be where the similarities end, mind. The camera is positioned on high, giving you a birds-eye view of your sneaking, for a start. 
</p>
<p>Eriksholm is also a fictional city, albeit inspired by Nordic-inspired cities of the 1900s. It looks like there's considerable unrest in the city, with the invention fo steam-driven machines, an authoritarian force hunting you for some reason, and something called the 'Heartpox' glimpsed in trailers. Maybe a bit of Dunwall-style worldbuilding, with yer Plague Tale family dynamics and Mimimi body-hiding? A canny mixture.
</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to us getting a chance to play this. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is aiming for release in 2025 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9">Epic</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dogubomb’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-prince-is-already-the-very-best-shapeshifting-videogame-house">my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game</a>, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">house made of house</a>. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Each room harbours secrets, and it’s your job to join those secrets up and discover the mysterious 46th room - which, strictly speaking, won’t fit into the floorplan. The only constraint placed upon the house’s werehousian tendencies is your character’s fatigue, which confines you to a certain number of steps each in-game day. You can bend that constraint, however, by means of various room properties and collectible objects. Sound fun? I bring good news, then - Blue Prince is now pegged to release in spring 2025. Here’s a trailer to celebrate.</p>

<p>And here are some piping hot press release bullet points, for people who couldn’t be bothered to click on my preview link, above.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Draft your journey - Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets, as well as offering or taking resources. But choose carefully, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms one sees today may not be the same rooms one sees tomorrow.</p>
<p>- Every step counts - Progress each day is shaped by the rooms selected to draft and the tools found within them. Yet, tread wisely – when the floor plan resets at the end of the day, all but the permanent upgrades to the estate blueprint will be lost.</p>
<p>- History in the making - Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail, political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children’s book author. The deeper one ventures, the more one realizes that the past is closer than it appears.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find a Blue Prince demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Steam</a>. Got you in the mood to read about bizarre virtual domiciles? Well, I recently did a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-does-it-mean-to-recreate-your-old-home-in-a-video-game">developers recreating and reinventing their own homes in video games</a>. There’s also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a>, in which houses try to seduce one another. And, of course, I’m bound by my RPS blood oath to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game%E2%80%9D">MyHouse.wad</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Covering announcement shows mean saving oneself for huge reveals, and since I might be the only person in the world right now this excited for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mekkablood-quarry-assault">Mekkablood: Quarry Assault</a>, I wondered if it might be better to hold off until a less pressing time. And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it's been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!</p>

<p>“They didn’t take my mech, and now they’re gonna take this two-tonne foot, straight up their corporate bums!” boasts the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duke-nukem">Duke Nukem</a> soundalike in the trailer. At least, I assume it’s ‘bums’. It’s bleeped out. It might be something more wholesome. Or something much, much worse. Either way, I’m down. That’s all the motivation I need these days.</p>
<p>Here’s what the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3056270/Mekkablood_Quarry_Assault/"> Steam page</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Year is 2082. You play the role of Bill, a grizzled, and extremely hairy robojockey. It's up to you to take the reigns of Bill's Mekk, with your friend Rusty, to get your revenge against TorxCorp, who's trying to steal your mining claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some features. Just the absolute best features. Love them.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mekk Combat</strong></p>
<p>Relive the glory days of the good old days with this first-person mech take on the classic Boomer Shooter gameplay. The in-cockpit view gives the retro 16-bit FPS feel a whole new twist.</p>
<p><strong>A Dance of Metal</strong></p>
<p>Moving around in your sluggish Mekk feels surprisingly smooth, Bill has truly mastered the giant robot’s controls like no other. And his weapons pack a punch! Make Swiss cheese of the enemies with bullets from afar or get up-close and personal with your dual saws.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Bill is a grizzled, and extremely hairy middle-aged man who doesn’t take shit from anyone. Torxcorp is going to get a 2-ton foot, straight up their ass for trying to take what is his.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets</strong></p>
<p>Discover secret areas in each level to find back your limited edition dash figurines. Spruce up your cockpit and watch them shake &amp; sway along with the action.</p></blockquote><p>


Mekkablood: Quarry Assault is "coming soon". Sucks for you, literally every other videogame.
