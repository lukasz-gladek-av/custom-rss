            <p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly October in my soul, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. Specifically, I dream of cruise liners. I’ve never been on an ocean cruise, but I’ve been on at least two North Sea ferries and in my mind, cruise ships are paradise. 
</p>
<p>They are places of luxury and possibly a few exotic murders - ocean-going adventurelands that perversely harbour swimming pools and waterslides. Imagine it, a boat with a pool. Such delicious unreason. Here to disabuse me of these visions is No More Robot’s Cruise Control, which makes cruise ships look like hell.

<p>It's a management sim created by a team who include former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> developers, but for all the ability to construct "fine dining" facilities, I see little of Overcooked’s saucy joyfulness in the trailer. I see suffocating bingo halls and arcade machines crammed together like tombstones. I see crowds so dense the people have no choice but to walk through each other.</p><p>I see trash and vomit and despairing janitors. I see carpet patterns that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent. I see potted cinemas that resemble factory farm incubators. I see dollar signs floating up from smiling, empty heads. Worst of all, I can’t see any waterslides or swimming pools.
</p>
<p>You wish to know what it’s like to <em>participate</em> in this inhumane simulation, this abject spawn of the Bermuda triangle? Very well. Cruise Control looks like a familiar rhythm of ensuring your ship has the facilities to keep your customers happy, while avoiding long queues to attractions and mechanical breakdowns. The more guests you serve, the more amenities you’ll acquire and upgrade. Perhaps there’s a waterslide to unlock, once enough bodies have been fed to the dancefloors. Fail to amuse the clientele sufficiently, and they'll send you direct to Davey Jones' Locker. Fools! We are all already there.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973220/Cruise_Control/">read more on Steam</a>. It’s out in 2026, and is the work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/not-tonight">Not Tonight</a> developers No More Robots. No More Robots are also publishers – their recent signings include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/">Little Rocket Lab</a>, a Stardew factory sim that I have downloaded the demo for and feel guilty about not playing yet. Final anecdote: I have a musician friend who once worked on a cruise liner. He lives on a boat now. I'm not sure he's really my friend. Perhaps my friend is still out there, queuing for bingo in the doldrums, and some creature of the deep sea has stolen his face.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair used its newfound success to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">start a publishing arm</a>. This, I think, is generally a net good, even if I have some feelings about the studio as a whole, which we'll dig into shortly. Nobody has money in this industry except for the few who do, so when a few of the few who do decide to put some of that money into much smaller games, that is somewhat of a win. But heed this warning from Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John Buckley: they won't publish your game if you use generative AI.
</p>
<p>
Buckley recently spoke with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a>, saying that he just "doesn't believe" in AI as a technology. Worth noting is that many often accuse Pocketpair of using the stuff in Palworld, a point Buckley does acknowledge: "People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."
</p>
<p>
Buckley does also know we're seeing more and more games releasing on Steam that he describes as "low quality, AI-made," but to counteract that he thinks "think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say 'no, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."
</p>
<p>
I do think it's worth highlighting the slight bit of irony here. The quality of Palworld notwithstanding, it is incredibly hard to argue that it doesn't harbour similar issues that AI has. Many of the Pal designs are a regurgitation of various Pokemon designs, but worse, or even more crude, removing them from their original contexts, or assigning them new ones that don't make much sense.
</p><p>
I'm not exactly thrilled that one of the poster creatures, that big yellow guy you can see up in the featured image, is essentially My Neighbour Totoro's titular beastie but with a gatling gun, personally. Everyone knows how anti-war Hayao Miyazaki is! It genuinely is great to hear a studio like Pocketpair, which has the financial capability to back other, smaller independent games, take a stance against AI. I just also hope that they look at the tech steadily encroaching on the games industry, and think about the ways they might perpetuate its aesthetic sensibilities.

            <p>If the interstellar equivalent of scrabbling around under the sofa for loose change or dragging a slightly rusty bumper out of a scrapyard is something you yearn for, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s latest update sounds right up your slightly grimy alley. It's dubbed Breach and adds in a bunch of mysterious shipwrecks to strip for new parts you can then glue to your own vessel. High stakes recycling, basically.</p>

<p>"In Breach, players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and on their travels encounter the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to your corvette-building arsenal, read the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">update's notes</a>. "Excavating these wrecks will yield an array of corvette pieces including rare vertical parts which unlock a whole new range of build configurations for the more creative designers." Some Atlas-themed bits are also out there for you to ping off with your laser and pocket.</p>
<p>As usual with these free updates to the space sim, there's a limited-time expedition to head out on. it looks to revolve around a the wreck of the Fireship Arcadia, with a trip to the edge of space and some general mysteriousness teased. "Many such wrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and there are rewards for the bravest of Travellers prepared to scavenge from them, including new vertical and structural parts which allow players to build colossal ships and rare, glowing Atlas-themed wings, engines and features," the notes say.</p><p>For those keen to know exactly what sorts of extra ship bits have been added in as par of this broadening of ship building horizons, Hello Games list landing gear, shields, weapons, and connectors, plus some "highly-requested wedge-shaped modules" so people can get a bit artsy with their builds. I assume by making ships shaped like wedges of cheese. They'd better add in moons made of cheese next, so I can do the dairy double and make Wallace of 'and Gromit' fame proud.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky's Breach update is out now. We've got you covered if you're thinking of hopping in for the first time in a while and so need quick refreshers as to what the long-running space explorer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-in-big-custom-ships-crewed-by-you-and-your-mates">last</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-latest-big-update-that-is-somehow-also-free-will-let-you-become-a-mayor-of-all-things">couple</a> of updates have included.</p>
