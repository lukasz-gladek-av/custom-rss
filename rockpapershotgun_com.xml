            <p>
Right, there's just a constant wall of bad news at the moment, so how about something a bit nicer. Earlier this year, Summerfall Studios announced that the Kickstarter for their demonic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> didn't work out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kickstarter-for-dragon-age-writer-david-gaiders-demonic-deckbuilder-malys-didnt-work-so-here-it-is-in-early-access-instead">so they'd be releasing it in early access instead</a>. Much like Kickstarters themselves, early access releases are risky business too, but it appears that at the very least it's worked well enough to grant the game a 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Summerfall shared word of this very fact yesterday, revealing a release date of October 23rd in the US and Europe, or October 24th in Oceania. "There are a million more things we’d put into Malys if we had the time and runway, but we’re so proud of where we’ve been able to get the game to, and how fun it is to play," Summerfall explained in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">devlog</a>. They also shared that you can expect them to be quiet in the lead-up to launch as they deal with last minute bits of feedback, as well as getting as much actual video game into the video games as possible (plus a bit of polish and "pizazz").
</p>
<p>
In terms of what to expect from 1.0, don't go too attached to your current save file, as it'll be completely reset when the update drops. With the full release, there will be a completely playable story, three regions to get through, a big music update, and the cherry on the icing, a final boss fight. Plus, there are double the "amount of random encounters, or the numerous new cards, curios, demons, consequences and rewards."
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been ensnared by Malys' dark and mysterious ways, it's one of those roguelike deckbuilders, one where you are a former priest turned demon-hunter who is going around a ruined city performing exorcisms. Summerfall Studios, quite notably, was also co-founded by original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so there's certainly some veteran skill attached to the project.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to pick up Malys now if you're at all interested, as the price will be going up slightly on launch - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449690/Malys/">it's available on Steam now</a>.
