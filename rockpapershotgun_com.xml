<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">Roguelike</a> deckbuilders! They're everywhere! It's a bit of an epidemic, honestly, sorting the wheat from chaff is a tough job. Of course, once in a while a genuinely novel take on the genre rolls around, and PinKeep has done just that, a pinball game where you change the playfield as you progress through runs. And it's from the devs behind the Far series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a>!
</p>
<p>
The pinball element is likely self explanatory. There's a ball, it gets shot off, and you have two flippers to hit it with, nothing new there. It's everything else around it that'll have you thinking about the beautiful game (in this world the beautiful game is pinball). Runs are split up into different themed stages, and it's up to you to add elements to the main playing field.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, say you want a bumper somewhere on the field to propel your ball along, you choose from the cards you've collected, and place it at various fixed points. You can rotate such structures to your liking, but to play these cards you need to spend money. To get money, you need to use your ball to destroy trees and rocks. Then you collect resources from these destroyed elements of nature, selling them to merchants at the top of the screen, of which you get to by flinging your ball successfully towards them.
</p><p>
This is further complicated by enemies slowly progressing towards your town of operations, and if they manage to reach you, you lose a bit of health. You'd think hitting enemies would be as much a bit of luck as it is skill, but you also have the ability to slow down time and flick your ball anytime you like, allowing you to line it up just so to take down an enemy combatant.
</p>
<p>
All this took some getting used to, with the fast-paced nature of pinball mixed with slowing down to plot out where you want being an interesting tactical exercise. The thing is, I just don't think you can go wrong with pinball, but the way you can build upon it here makes it much more strategic. Take the aforementioned bumper you can add in. It comes with the added effect of a little goblin that sits on top of it who shoots out arrows at incoming arrows if you hit said bumper.
</p>
<p>
When you build up your field just right there's a nice harmony to it all. I do wonder if adding in changes to the slow motion flick or the flippers themselves would add something or overcomplicate things, but as it is in its current demo, PinKeep is heading in the right direction. You can try it out for yourself, or just wishlist it, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700">here</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was never a game that was going to win me over, as I generally only like single-player shooters if any, but it isn't helped by the fact that since its announcement there hasn't been a lick of actual marketing to help it prove itself. This, of course, has been the subject of much discourse, to which I will contribute slightly in the coming paragraphs, but the main point of all this is to say that actually, against all odds, Highguard is in fact sticking to its January 26th launch date, and will even show off some gameplay… on its release day.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a singular Dweet on the game's Dwitter account, explaining the following: "Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase. Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more." You'll note Devolver Digital being its usual cheeky self in the replies asking if the devs need a publisher; "There's still time."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Now, I don't care to be marketed to, excessively, moderately, or conservatively, the last of which is still generous in Highguard's case. It's just I can't tell if releasing a game after one trailer is an act of supreme hubris, well-placed confidence, or riding on the assumption that it being from the creators of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. I have to wonder if developer Wildlight Entertainment thought that such a pedigree was enough in this pre-established property-led world we live in.
</p>
<p>
Highguard might have some old guard talent, but we don't live in the same world as film, plastering names over trailers of other games doesn't suggest guaranteed quality, it invites comparison. Games have to prove themselves in the pudding, and so far on most counts Highguard hasn't done a very good job of that. The only benefit it currently has is all of this technically bad (absent) PR might make enough people curious enough to play it, and it is free so that's easy enough to do. Guess we'll find out in a week or so!
