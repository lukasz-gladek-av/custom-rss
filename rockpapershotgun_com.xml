            <p>Tides Of Torment, the next DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, has been pushed back from its original Summer release window to later in the year, with September onwards sounding the likeliest from a<a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75"> new blog post</a>.</p>
<p>And that's…honestly where the bad news ends, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the blog is filled with some exciting and pretty respectable thoughts about future updates. Even the reason for Tides Of Torment's delay ("the short answer was no", it didn't hit the team's standards) strikes me as a good sign, since it means the DLC team at least feel they've got the breathing room to not rush out something they're not happy with. It's too nice outside for my PC to be running the kind of temps 1000 angry sea elves are going to result in, anyway.</p>
<p>Ah, yes: Sea Elves are confirmed now, led by Sea Lord Aislinn. Expect more details from a new video in August, by the sound of it.</p>

<p>There's siege improvements coming to the Proving Ground beta branch later this month. If you asked Sigvald, he'd surely sound sceptical sieges can be salvaged from their shabby state and shone to the standard seen in superior <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy games</a>, but since Sofia have…already released some clever updates, I'm feeling <em>mildly optimistic</em> about whatever they've got planned here.</p>
<p>In August, Lizardmen and Tomb Kings are getting some quality of life shinies and updated starting traits, and generic Greenskin characters are getting some skill line buffs. And then…</p>
<blockquote><p>"On the topic of the road ahead, we also want to acknowledge the growing conversation we see about the game's future beyond Tides of Torment. We’ve seen a few folk asking for specific characters that might not fit in any of our current DLC formats, so we are exploring how we might introduce a smaller style of DLC that brings a single LL, or Hero Unit alongside a few favoured additions. We’re working out how these would fit with our schedules, but we have a good idea for who the first one could be, and she’s someone near and dear to your blood."</p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit is very likely a hint toward Vampire lord Neferata, but I'm more interested in what this might mean for future expansions. The blog later drops hints for a teaser for an announcement of a promise at CA's 25th anniversary bash in December for "one of the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> content packs ever created in the trilogy", which might have a few of you huffing the Clan Skurvy grog fumes if you've kept up with things. </p>
<p>One of the more credible lines of speculation I've seen is that this is some sort of End Times pack, marking the winding down of the trilogy in favour of Total Warty Thousand, itself expected to be announced as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">multiple new Total War games CA have hinted at</a>. But single lord or other smaller DLCs sound like a great way to extend the life of Warhammer 3 without requiring the resources of the bigger expansions. Also, Rich Aldridge said he likes Halfling Soup Tanks in a video once. Just saying. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates]]></content:encoded>
