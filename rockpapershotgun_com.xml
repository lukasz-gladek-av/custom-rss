Tron is a world that I feel constantly surprised by its perseverance in just flat out still being a thing all these years later. And yet, I never feel upset about it given that the vibes of Tron just absolutely rule no matter the context in which they're being delivered, the upcoming Jared Leto led film notwithstanding because of that guy's whole vibe. In terms of what's actually next for the fictitious video game world, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> from the folks over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bithell-games">Bithell Games</a>, and as it so happens, there's a demo out for it today!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/">available on Steam</a>, apparently makes up the first hour of the game, which certainly sounds like a healthy amount of time to suss out its vibes. In case you missed the announcement on this one, Tron: Catalyst is a top-down, sort of but not quite isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game where you play as Exo, a courier whose life gets shaken up by a mysterious package exploding leaving him with unusual abilities.
</p>
<p>
It's set in the Arq <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grid">Grid</a>, a location previously established in Bithell Games' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a>, a visual novel set in the Disney-owned universe. Storywise, the Arq Grid is a bit unstable, with glitches causing time to loop, and only Exo can see them. Lots of good stuff to latch onto here, and yes, you do have a Disc to fight with and a Light Cycle to ride around on, everything you'd want from a Tron game is here.
</p>
<p>
If you're not the demo type, one, did you never buy a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the 2000s, and, two, that's fine, because it's due out on June 17th, just a couple of weeks away. I'm sure that's enough time to get some distance from the launch of the Switch 2, and Summer Game Fest, and tomorrow's PlayStation showcase, and the millions of other showcases happening in way too short of a timespan.

Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-mindseye-even-with-your-first-actual-gameplay-trailer-i-still-dont-believe-youre-a-real-game">I questioned whether MindsEye was a real game or not</a>. This week, that question lingers. Why, you ask? Well, as spotted by our good friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two executives at the studio behind the game, Build a Rocket Boy, have now departed the company. Let me just check when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> is coming outâ€¦ oh, that's right, literally one week from today. Surely this is only good news!
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADDOgdoB1gzNggnuaGLIXM_FUprl3u0285o">LinkedIn post</a> from yesterday, now former chief legal officer Riley Graebner shared news of his departure after three and a half years at the company, saying he was "proud" of what the team has accomplished in that time. Former chief financial officer Paul Bland doesn't seem to have made an announcement of his exit per se, but the experience section of his own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn account</a> lists his time at Build a Rocket Boy as ending in June (typically roles listed on LinkedIn will say "present" if a person is still at the company).
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but two executives leaving a studio, no matter their position, doesn't scream "incoming success story." There could be any myriad of reasons as to why they've left of course, this is just speculation, the timing is just a bit odd so close to release for such high level positions.
</p>
<p>
Thus far hardly any actual gameplay of MindsEye has been shown off, though publisher IO Interactive did announce a showcase for this Friday, June 6th, where more of it will be shown off. Will it be overshadowed by IO's own James Bond game that's also getting a proper look-in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-is-the-new-james-bond-game-from-hitman-makers-io-interactive">now revealed to be called 007 First Light</a>? Almost certainly, but at least there might be more than five minutes of gameplay this time around.

            <p>
Let's start this one with a definition: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is "one of those kinda games." By that I mean it's a four player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> title that doesn't really adhere to a particular genre, predominantly prioritising mechanics that allow you and some friends to get up to some shenanigans. Like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, or REPO, you know, one of those kinda games! Now we've got that out of the way, let me introduce you to Roadside Research, one of those kinda games, except this time you are an incredibly poorly disguised alien running a gas station in order to research humans. See what I mean?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's a delectably silly concept, right down to said disguises literally just being bits of paper taped to the grey (and not grey) aliens' faces. In terms of the moment to moment gameplay, you'll be doing things a perfectly regular human working at a gas station would do: restock shelves, refuel customers' cars, "exchange goods for cash."

<p>
You'll need to cook and clean too, I'm assuming that second one is those hot dogs that roll on those spinning poles you're 100% sure have never been cleaned. Once you've finished a day's work, you can upgrade your gas station - again, a typical human thing to do - to help bring in more people the following day.
</p>
<p>
There's Men in Black-looking government officials to avoid too, for a bit of a threat. Overall it just looks like a silly good time, I'm not massively into online co-op games generally, but this recent trend of comedy online co-op games where there's often not really any violence is certainly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
Roadside Research doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3643170/Roadside_Research/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.
