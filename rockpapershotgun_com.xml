            <p>
I find city builders to be quite a stressful genre, mostly because I get freaked out as soon as my virtual bank account starts dipping into the red. Every now and then, though, one comes along that looks like it might actually be a calming time, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/synergy">Synergy</a> looks like it could fill that gap. It's been out in early access for almost a year now, but developer Leikir Studio announced today that Synergy will be leaving early access and entering 1.0 in just two weeks time on April 16th.
</p>

<p>
The announcement came with a new trailer that keeps things brief but hands over the important thing (the aforementioned release date), as well as an overall look at what the game will offer. Over on Steam, though, a few more details about what the 1.0 update will bring. First up is that there'll be a new campaign with three new scenarios to explore, though what those are, you'll have to wait and find out.

<p>
There's also new plants and buildings to work with, as well as some new challenges linked to dry seasons, alongside an exploration rework. Outside of saying "and more", the Steam post just makes note that there'll be "huge [Quality of Life] improvements you've been waiting for", but again, not specifics, so you'll probably have to check out the 1.0 patch notes whenever they drop.
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with Synergy, you can probably guess just from looking at its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moebius">Moebius</a>-inspired stylings that it's a lot more plant and nature focused as opposed to the concrete jungles or historical encampments you might usually find in the genre. You can explore different regions, build up community, learn about its alien world. Nothing too stressful to be found here, just the way I like my sim games. You can check it out on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989070/Synergy/">here</a>.
