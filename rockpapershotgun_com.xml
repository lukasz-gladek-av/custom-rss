            <p>Grand yet furtive robot action-adventure Steel Seed will launch on April 10th, developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/storm-in-teacup">Storm in a Teacup</a> and publishers ESDigital Games have announced. Not heard of Steel Seed before? You would've if I'd ever written up that demo build I played at last year's Game Developer Conference. I don't know why it's taken me this long to mention the game, given that it contains one of my favourite things in fiction: a machine the size of a world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Steel Seed you play Zoe, a nimble and upgradeable robot, and her flying drone acquaintance Koby. You're exploring a vast cybernetic undercity created by overclocked WALL-Es to preserve the last human survivors of a global apocalypse.</p>
<p>The overarching story is about "exploring the fine line between human and machine, trust and control, resilience and despair", but in the moment, Steel Seed is more about exploring the fine line between crouch-walk back-stabbing and open combat with electroswords and Koby's ranged attacks. Needless to say, you'll also be doing a lot of platforming: leaping to handholds, wall-running, sliding down ramps, all the classics.</p>

<p>I wasn't mesmerised by the jumpy-sneaky-slashy elements of the GDC 2024 build I played. It felt like a sturdy but essentially makeshift cobbling-together of parts from other action-adventures. I can't knock the environments, however, which consist of layer upon layer of unsleeping industrial machinery - gushing cyclopean smelters, sunset-sized reactor cores and turbiney wotsits made up of individually rotating and grippable sections.</p>
<p>The extra frisson of architectural intrigue is that Steel Seed takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's Blame!, among other megacity mangas. I haven't read Blame!, so my nearest parallels are other video games - last year's superbly unaccommodating spelunking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>, and Ninja Theory's ageing Serkis 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west">Enslaved: Odyssey To The West</a>.</p>
<p>If you like the sounds of all this, but you're umming and erring over my indifference to the combat and stealth, the good news is that Steel Seed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/">has a demo on Steam</a>. It includes the game's intro and gives you a taste of the robot-bashing and/or bamboozling ahead.

</p><p>Storm in a Teacup have form for moody sci-fi - their previous games include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-to-the-sun">Close To The Sun</a>, which Alice Bee (RPS in peace) found a little too Bioshlock in places but was otherwise quite pleased with. "Close To The Sun exists in a potential sweet spot for me, a mix of horror and leisurely exploration, and I enjoyed a lot of it," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/close-to-the-sun-review">wrote in our review</a>. "It excels at toying with you, particularly in the first half of the game, and paces itself so that you're constantly tense even when you have nothing to fear."</p>

            <p>
With several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors in the works from former staff, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy regarding the exits of key team members</a> behind the beloved RPG, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">an in-development expansion cancelled</a>, you might have been wondering what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zaum">Studio ZA/UM</a> will do next. Well, that answer is here. In a recent presentation held for the press, ZA/UM revealed a first look at their next game. It's called C4 and it's about espionage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The presentation was led by Jim Ashilevi, the lead voice over director on Disco Elysium, and Siim "Kosmos" Sinamäe, a producer and writer for the RPG, who are both serving as writers on this new game. Right off the bat, Sinamäe made one thing quite clear: "This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4." The writer went on to explain that ZA/UM has "spent the last three years developing this brand new, gripping, completely original world, exploring a theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>

<p>
While the presentation didn't offer a look at anything in-game, a short teaser trailer for C4 was shown which mostly consisted of a woman with a London accent talking in a very Disco Elysium-y kind of way, set to some very cool looking art. Story details were pretty slim too, but Ashilevi did explain that "C4 is all about spy games, allegiances, and betrayals. It is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, the gadgets. It is more like Slow Horses, doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or parades. No heroes, only the stench of failure." Failing forward will also apparently be a big part of what sets the game apart, with Ashilevi saying the team is making "failure a joy in itself".
</p>
<p>
This presentation is just part one of two, as ZA/UM is also apparently making an appearance at GDC later this month, where it will presumably talk more about the game.
</p>
<p>
C4 is obviously the first project following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-developer-alleges-creative-leads-were-fired-on-false-premises">the departure</a> of Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere and artist Aleksander Rostov in 2021. What followed has been a series of messy legal battles, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIGA8taN-M&amp;ab_channel=PeopleMakeGames">documentary</a> that alleged toxicity from Kurvitz and more, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">different</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">games</a> claiming to be spiritual successors. I'm looking forward to finding out if the OG ZA/UM can cut through all of that noise.
