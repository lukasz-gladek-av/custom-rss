A new day, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a>! Today the particular entry in this far reaching genre we're talking about is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farthest-frontier">Farthest Frontier</a>, because it's leaving early access after more than three years in development. If you've never heard of it before, the simple answer is that Farthest Frontier is a medieval city builder. The longer answer includes all the things it does.
</p>
<p>
For one, there's apparently more than 190 buildings you can build, as you start your old timey town as just that before eventually growing it into a living, breathing city. Quite literally, as apparently villagers in the game live out their days in real time. You could pick a random villager, watch them as they head to work, see them delivering things to various townspeople. Sounds neat!

<p>
You can grow up to 12 different kinds of crops, all of which have specific needs from making sure the soil is appropriately fertile, to needing to prevent temperature-related damage, to good old fashioned diseases. There's invaders to be fought off too, if you don't have the game's pacifist mode turned on, requiring you to properly equip your village and its people to defend themselves.
</p><p>
In terms of the big 1.0 features, progression has apparently received a big revamp with a new 142-point tech tree. There'll be even more buildings, plus decorations and landmarks to build, and even a bridge system. You'll also find a new policy system, which according to a press release adds "more agency to civic management." Not to mention some updated animations, including for those aforementioned villagers.
</p>
<p>
If all of this sounds like it's up your alley, well, again, it's out today! And available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/">here</a>! Go nuts!

            <p>The bit of reporting I'm about to relay to you probably isn't surprising, but it's worth making sure you've got a pillow on standby to scream into once you've digested it. Microsoft, they of more money than a company could ever need or know what to do with, have reportedly spent the last two years pushing Xbox to deliver profit margins which are well above the industry average. Cue all of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everwild-screenshots-leak-after-microsoft-cancellation-and-youd-seemingly-have-been-a-walking-garden-centre">cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">shutterings</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins">Bloomberg</a> have reported this profits push, which they cite as having seen company execs set an across-the-board goal of 30% profit margins, or "accountability margins" as they're known in Microsoft corpospeak. Not every individual game or project is expected to hit the 30% mark, but lots of developers across Xbox have been made aware of the target, the report claims.</p>
<p>The 30% goal reportedly came into force from autumn 2023, when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood's team took up a more prominent role, with Xbox moving away from a past which Bloomberg's sources claim wasn't as doggedly driven by financial metrics as the be all and end all.</p>
<p>To put the margin being aimed for in context, Bloomberg turn to data analytics firm S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, who put the average profit margin in the games industry at between 17% and 22% in recent years. Xbox's profit margins over the past six years are cited as has having landed somewhere between the 10% and 20% marks. According to S&amp;P analyst Neil Barbour, hitting 30% or more is "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it".</p><p>Along with the move we've already seen Xbox make towards cross-platform releases which aim to maximise the cash a game can bring in, rather than using it as a tool to try and tempt players onto Xbox consoles or Game Pass, the report cites sources as having pointed to an increasing risk averseness in terms of the games Microsoft green light as a likely consequence going forwards. Basically, if it ain't massive and dripping with clear cash-grabbing potential, it might not get made. Meanwhile, on the hardware front, that division's suggested to possibly be in line for "a significant rethinking".</p>
<p>It's a state of affairs you could guess pretty easily just by reading the tea leaves of the corp's moves over the past year and a bit, but damn if it isn't still depressing to have the unnecessarily greedy motivation behind it all reported in black and white.</p>
