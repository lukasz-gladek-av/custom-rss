            <p>A game that sees you forcibly kidnapped, smuggled aboard a mega yacht dubbed The Avarice, and made to play demon billionaires at lethal dice poker just got a new trailer, and it looks as funky as you’d expect. Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game is its uber-snappy name, and it’s coming to Steam this summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spooky-cyberpunk-mystery-psychroma-looks-like-detention-meets-observer">Psychroma</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raptor-boyfriend-is-a-rare-coming-of-age-story-that-actually-respects-teenagers">Raptor Boyfriend</a> developers Rocket Adrift Games released a trailer for this roguelike dice builder as part of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyRhu8kWv2E">The Mix showcase</a>, and as soon as I clapped my eyes on it, I was intrigued.</p>

<p>The big boat of these bad money creatures is rendered in a “grungy 1-bit aesthetic”. Aboard, you’ll be treated to an experience that looks quite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-ish except with dice instead of cards, and a lot more severing of fingers. Yep, you bet one of your digits each round, and if your five dice don’t boast the highest poker hand after three re-rolls, the demon billionaire you’re playing against gets to chuckle as you lose an appendage.</p>
<p>The first of you to be separated from all of your feelers loses the game and suffers a lethal punishment. In your case, being lobbed overboard in what’s a rather wet end to that particular run. Every failed run adds to the game’s “body count”, and you play as a new character every time, though with an option to pass useful items between runs via the “hidden compartment of your cell”.</p>
<p>You’ll need to craft custom dice with “demonically sealed special abilities” using your poker winnings as you strive to beat the game’s five bosses, as well as making use of charms and curses you unlock.</p>
<p>Also, Dead Finger Dice’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice_A_Billionaire_Killing_Game/">Steam page</a> notes that it features “class consciousness”, a “revolutionary body count”, and is “completely human-made” via its developers’ own fingers. Cool, the Che Guevara of deck builders that use dice. It’s got me convinced, even if I’ve spent about 6 million less hours with Balatro than most other people seem to have.</p>
<p>Hey, I’ve had fun with what I have played of it, don’t come for me joker mafia. Dead Finger Dice is set to drop on on Steam in Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
