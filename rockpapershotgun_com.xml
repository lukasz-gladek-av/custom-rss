            <p>
Microsoft are reshuffling their Xbox Game Pass subscription tiers and hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in certain regions. You'll now need to pay $29.99 a month for Ultimate - a 50% jump, with pricing for places outside the US to follow. PC Game Pass subscriptions are going up from $11.99 to $16.49 monthly - around 40 percent higher. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we're trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well," Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, told the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Verge</a> in a briefing. "It's something we don't take lightly, and we're listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they're asking for." 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are attempting to sweeten the pill by means of larger game catalogues per tier, expanded access to their cloud gaming services, and various other perks detailed in full on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">the Xbox Newswire</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimate now includes access to various Ubisoft games via Ubisoft Plus Classics, plus the Fortnite Crew service, which spans a load of seasonal Fortnite stuff.  Ultimate subscribers will also get access to the poshest version of Microsoft's cloud gaming service, which includes 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements on certain devices. Microsoft are also promising to increase the number of Xbox games coming to Ultimate at release day. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential ($9.99/month, around 50 games), and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium ($14.99/month, around 200 games). Both tiers now include access to new cloud gaming features alongside PC games. While neither of these services will cost more than Core and Premium in the US, they'll see pricing adjustments in some regions. Again, more to follow.
</p>
<p>PC Pass subscribers benefit the least from all these changes, seemingly. "The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass," Blackwell told the Verge. "It will continue to get day one titles."</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">note</a>, Microsoft's Game Pass price hikes come in the wake of both record returns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. Game Pass <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">earned them $5 billion last year</a>, while Microsoft saw an overall 18 percent increase in revenue to $76.4 billion. Microsoft have also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">bumped up the price of their console hardware</a> in the USA. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subscription-models-like-xbox-game-pass-are-not-properly-valuing-developers-says-former-bethesda-exec">debates continue</a> about whether videogame subscription services are good for participating developers.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are also currently the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">a consumer boycott over their business partnerships with the Israeli military</a> during the latter's assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which a UN commission of inquiry has now <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds">formally defined as a genocide</a>. The Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement has specifically called on people to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions until Microsoft divest fully from the state. The company recently announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">block Israeli military access to Azure and AI services</a> used for a specific surveillance project that violates their terms of service, but they continue to do business with Israel's armed forces at large.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has gotten its first hotfix since releasing in 1.0 form late last month, with Supergiant taking care of a bunch of issues. Some are related to the narrative threads you'll need to pull en-route to the true ending to Melinoë's task. One stops a pesky bug that'd have driven me straight to the verge of quitting for good cropping up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Without any further ado, let's proceed into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505089031138181922?l=english">Steam post chamber</a> and see if reading the notes nets any nectar. "Several narrative scripting issues with specific events involving Hecate" have been rectified, Supergiant wrote. They've also solved a problem which led her not to speak about REDACTED in a certain situation.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to trust me on this in order for this newsing not to wander into spoiler territory, REDACTED is very important to the final bit of Hades 2's plot, so while this issue with Hecate doesn't look to be uber-critical, I'm glad to see Supergiant are making sure there are no issues with the narrative gears around it. Especially given how fragmented the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s story beats can be since they're wrapped around and amongst different runs.</p>
<p>The other fix that's caught my eye is one that stops Mel being automatically returned to shadow - that's the death that ends a run - right at the moment she defeats the fearsome final boss of the Olympus path. As I found out while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">reviewing the 1.0 version of the game</a>, said boss is arguably a tougher challenge than old time bloke Chronos himself, so you best believe if I managed to get all that way just to be denied a chance to bask in the glory of Zeus and co's crib, I wouldn't be best pleased. It never happened to me, luckily, but even imagining it's enough to make the hairs on my neck stand up.</p><p>Beyond those, there's an important-sounding fix for "key incantations" not being completeable "due to modified data" and one for a bit of cool dialogue which sees the giant Polyphemus react uniquely to a certain keepsake being equipped not firing properly.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the fixes, they non-spoilery ones are as follows, with the few I've left out being findable in the Steam post linked earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed most Olympian Keepsake effects not activating again after their Boon is skipped</li>
<li>Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants</li>
<li>Fixed Fated List Prophecies related to Hidden Aspects not clearing in specific circumstances</li>
<li>Fixed the Achievement Soothing Soak not unlocking from events with Moros</li>
<li>Fixed the Achievement So Mote It Be unlocking sooner than expected</li>
<li>Fixed Gorgon Amulet (Athena) using up the effect of Yarn of Ariadne (Charon) when it shouldn't</li>
<li>Fixed an interaction between Uncommon Upbringing (Hera) and Concave Stone (Echo)</li>
<li>Fixed key visual effects sometimes not playing on some systems</li>
<li>Fixed Canines spawned from Lycaons unexpectedly activating Unseen Ire (Hades)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you could not exit the final Location in Erebus in a certain case</li>
<li>Fixed cases where taking Armor damage with Trusty Shield (Hephaestus) could damage your semi-permanent Armor instead</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue that involved claiming Gemstones then immediately using one of Homer's Inspect Points</li>
<li>Fixed Hecuba running back and forth in the chamber with Narcissus</li>
<li>Fixed several rare crashes</li>
<li>Updates to translations in some languages</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with Chinese Input Method</li>
<li>Other minor fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, be on your Melinoë.</p>
