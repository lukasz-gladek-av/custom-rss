            <p>January 12th, 2026. It's my next birthday, and also now the date that BioWare exosuit shooter Anthem will finally be taken offline. I very much assume the two things are unrelated.</p>
<p>The live-service thing that EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-canceling-their-anthem-overhaul-to-focus-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age">abandoned doing live-service stuff for</a> not that long after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">well-documentedly difficult development</a> was followed by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">lukewarm release</a> is finally going the way of the dodo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," EA wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">a post</a> on their website, "This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline."</p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that," the publisher added, also letting us know that this shutdown isn't resulting in any layoffs. It might seem a strange clarification to make - Anthem hasn't been a going concern for years and EA have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">sliced BioWare's staff</a> post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Veilguard</a>, but I guess the company have just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">read the room</a> for once and want to make clear any potential consequences for the developers, rather than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">sliding around the subject</a> as they have in other announcements.</p>
<p>Once that plug's pulled, Anthem will cease to be playable since it's an online-only affair. That means you've got roughly 192 days to do as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-huh-biowares-exosuit-shooter-anthem-is-still-online">our Alice O did back in 2023</a> - suddenly remember that Anthem exists and hop in to give it a go like you're taking one last joyride in an old car that'll never get the work done to stop it imminently being resigned to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>She wrote the following of that sojourn to the abandoned kingdom of Anthem:</p>
<blockquote>Is Anthem good? No. It's a looter-shooter with boring loot and perfunctory shoot. But I like parts," "Flying my cool-looking exosuit around is pleasant, lazily swooping around the skies of an alien world. It's an involved movement too, because the suit slowly heats up and you need to regularly cool it by diving downwards or flying through waterfalls and such. I'm always happy when simply getting about involves playful little motions. And I'm kind of interested in some of the traditionally BioWare-y NPC chatter and storybits going on back at the hub base? But the rest of the game's not good enough for me to persist.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I've just checked and assuming you don't already own it, you'll need to pay for an EA Play subscription to try <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/buy/pc">Anthem on PC</a> before its song is sung. The game's also set to be removed from that service in 43 days' time, as of writing, so your window's suddenly gotten a lot smaller.</p></div>

            <p>Sorry, historical farming village folk. You live in the sea now. Ok, fine. <em>By</em> the sea. But that's the best we can do. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails expansion is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/261550?emclan=103582791456145274&amp;emgid=536603447519084797">due this Autumn</a>, and TaleWorlds have put out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/261550?emclan=103582791456145274&amp;emgid=536605983645895612">a new deep dive blog</a> covering what to expect from the big battle strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s first  foray into wavely warfare. Shiver me tambourines and other such phrases that would have confused a viking, here's the first trailer in case you missed it.</p>

<p>As is good journalistic practise, I'll start with the bit I find the funniest, conceptually, especially if I imagine it as a newspaper headline. "Several towns have been moved closer to water". Rivers have also been widened, and bridges have been "reconsidered". This is all part of TaleWorld's efforts to reshape "the very veins of the continent", ostensibly to widen the maritime trade network, though I suspect it's actually just to give you more targets to boat batter.</p>
<blockquote><p>"For settlements now hugging rivers and coasts, danger sails closer — rival ports are now just a voyage away. To meet this new maritime threat, both parties and armies can now travel by water, gaining access to naval movement and combat."</p></blockquote>
<p>The world map is also being expanded with "a new rugged long strip of a south-facing coastline". Coincidentally, rugged long is also my stripper name. Here's the map:</p>

<p>Returning to coastline plundering, TaleWorlds have also detailed the part naval warfare will play in sieges. Namely blockades, which will be automatically formed after setting up a siege camp, as long as the siege target is a naval settlement and the besiegers have ships available. As a player, you can also reinforce besieged towns from water - "either by breaking through the blockade at the cost of some troops, or by attacking the fleet directly to lift it."</p>
<p>A few other bits of interest: If you dock and then go pottering about on land, you'll be able to summon your ships again from any coastal town. Sailing itself will be aided or hindered by wind speed and currents, and you'll have to contend with attrition, from hazards like storms and regular old disrepair, while you're out there.</p>
<p>How is Bannerlord these days? I played it for about fifty very good hours when it came out and haven't touched it since. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review">reviewed it back in 2022</a> and didn't reckon it was a meaningful upgrade from the previous. "I still enjoy Bannerlord because there's nothing else doing those open world battles," she wrote. "But almost everything else is a robotic, shallow grind offering no surprises, with a plethora of complaints that early access is supposed to iron out".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-expansion-is-terraforming-the-land-to-encourage-maximum-boat-bastardry]]></content:encoded>
