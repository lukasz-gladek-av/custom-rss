            <p>If you like your Bethesda <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with a bit more of another sort of Bethesda RPG, I've got good news. An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> modder's decided to put another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a> feature into the 2006's hottest 'supposed to be a jungle, but Lord of the Rings is popular' game. This time, it's Adoring Fan skill bobbleheads, and they might help you come to find the annoying lad a bit more loveable.</p>
<p>Hey, if nothing else, you can stick them on the mantelpiece of that house you're using Obiliv in a thing called love's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">Fallout-inspired settlement building mod</a> to erect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4997">Bobbleheads of Cyrodiil</a>'s the name of the latest entry in the burgeoning genre, and it's the work of modder TheJaceWindu. "Ever wanted your own collection of tiny versions of Cyrodiil’s most infamous fanboy? No? [Too] bad," they wrote, "Because now there are 15 of them scattered across Cyrodiil, each lovingly sculpted in the image of the one and only Adoring Fan!"</p>
<p>They're not lying about the lovingly sculpted bit either. Each Adoring Fan bobblehead can pass perfectly for a little plastic model of the Arena's backrub merchant, and as with Fallout's Vault Boys, he's posed/dressed to mirror each skill the trinkets improve. I think my favourite's the one triumphantly posed in Imperial legion armour, which I assume to be the heavy armour bobblehead. Or maybe it's the one that improves your ability to bellow at random criminal scum, then get them in a tight camera zoom headlock, who knows?</p>

<p>"Each bobblehead grants a unique passive perk tied to a skill! Ranging from Heavy Armour to Speechcraft, Sneak to Alchemy," TheJaceWindu explains. "Find one, and you’ll gain a permanent boost. Find them all, and you’ll unlock the Collector’s Perk: a juicy bonus of +20 Luck and +100 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/feather">Feather</a>, because nothing says 'I’ve earned it' like hauling around a backpack full of tiny fans.</p><p>"The perks are permanent. Once you collect the little fan you get a passive ability perk that is unique to the associated skill! This means you don't have to keep them in your inventory! Unless you want to, as they weigh nothing! But you can use them to decorate your homes or spruce up your favorite local fighters guild."</p>
<p>They add that they've stuffed the fans in a bunch of nooks and crannies all over Cyrodiil, with some in building, others out in the wilderness, and a few sticking out more than an Elven bloke yelling 'By Azura'. In all seriousness, as much as this mod's not going to suit gritty Oblivion playthroughs (if such a thing is possible, I've not pulled one off yet), I'm definitely bookmarking it in case I need to spice up future wacky ones.</p>
<p>Also, my first thought when I saw this mod was that Adoring Fan bobbleheads are surely among the gift shop tat you can buy in real life, right? Having glanced at <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/search?q=adoring+fan&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last">Bethesda's official store</a>, while you can get Adoring Fan badges and plushies, it seems they've not thought to crack the bobblehead market with him yet. Maybe they're worried it might cause that Hollywood primadonna Vault Boy to waltz off to his agent and demand more money.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're up for a bit of bobblehead collecting in Oblivion Remastered, you'll first need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p>
