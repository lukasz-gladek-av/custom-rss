            <p>If you found the feudal festival of backstabbing that was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> distressingly upbeat and wholesome, perhaps you'll be more impressed by Never's End, a new turn and grid-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny</a>'s former lead sandbox gameplay designer Ryan Jucket with character designs from Final Fantasy artist Masayoshi Nishimura.</p>
<p>It takes place in a world swamped by creeping undead darkness, and casts you as a warrior spirit wrought of deathless silver. Taking charge of the last surviving village, you will possess and burn away the very souls of townsfolk in order to transform them into battlefield units. Careful, though, because the more villagers you catch in your mirrors and reduce to living weapons, the stronger the Never becomes.</p><!--more-->

<p>If that were all there were to Never's End, I might have given it a miss. The other source of intrigue here is that battles put a big emphasis on using spells to modify the terrain and atmospheric conditions. "Temperature, weather, wind, water level, and even the density of the earth beneath your feet can all be manipulated to gain the advantage in combat," observes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999930/Nevers_End/">the Steam page</a>. "Drain rivers dry or flood the battlefield. Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava."</p>
<p>Sounds like a jolly time. The last tactical RPG I played that meddled with the air and soil this extravagantly was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>, and I've been hankering for a similar feat of geomancy. I'm also quite sold on the art style, which suggests a handsome Dreamcast remake of a PS1 game.</p>
<p>Going by the launch description, the campaign will give you the choice of when to mount an assault on the heart of the Never, which pumps out fresh boglins at regular intervals. There's an open-ended overworld full of jungles, deserts and tundra where you'll go on hunting missions and pick through the treasures of a forgotten golden age. Very Destiny-ish, indeed.</p>
<p>"Cleanse corrupted settlements, awaken long-dormant temples, unearth lost technology, and then reap the rewards as civilization rebuilds in your wake," comments the Steam page. The rebuilding theme extends to the founding of new towns, each a source of (willing?) husks for your zombo war effort.</p>
<p>Are you the real villain here? Well, put it this way: when you're felled in combat, you're reborn at HQ as a rapidly congealing pool of liquid silver. The last time I saw somebody do that it was the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and he did not strike me as promising village management material.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Back in 2023, several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">former Ubisoft executives were taken into custody</a> by French police, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">allegations of sexual harassment, workplace abuse, sexism and violence</a> in 2020. Now, some of those executives have appeared in court in Bobigny, Seine-Saint-Denis to defend their alleged role in cultivating a workplace where women were frequently assaulted or humiliated by senior members of staff.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former Ubisoft executives in question are Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer, who resigned after the 2020 allegations, and is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. According to his lawyer, he "denies any knowledge of reprehensible acts committed by collaborators at Ubisoft and did not receive any reports of this." Former vice-president of editorial and creative services Tommy François is also accused of sexual harassment, bullying and attempted sexual assault. He denies all charges. Former game director Guillaume Patrux, finally, is accused of sexual harassment and bullying. He, too, denies all charges.</p>
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">Guardian</a>, the court proceedings include more details about the allegations against the three executives, and what one Ubisoft staffer characterised as a "boys' club above the law". All the events in question were said to have taken place between 2012 and 2020.</p>
<p>Amongst other accusations, one woman was reportedly informed that wearing a coat with a red lining was "an invitation to rape", while another was told that her outfit had given somebody an erection. The most serious allegations include tying a female employee to a chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. The same woman allegedly had her face drawn on with a marker pen and was forced to attend a meeting without washing it off. Some men are said to have been targeted, with one office game involving touching their genitals through their trousers.</p>
<p>There are also claims of religious hatred. A Muslim developer reports being ostracised after the 2015 jihadist Bataclan concert hall attacks in Paris. She also allegedly found bacon sandwiches placed on her desk or thrown at her during Ramadan. </p>
<p>During the court proceedings, a few of the individual alleged abuses were attributed to the three former Ubisoft executives on trial. Hascoët is said to have told staff that he should have sex with a colleague in a meeting room in front of everyone "to show how to calm her". François is accused of trying to kiss a woman on the mouth while his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back at an office Christmas party in 2015. François reportedly told the court this week that "I never tried to harm anyone" and that there had been a "culture of joking around."</p>
<p>As for Patrux, the allegations against him include miming physical attacks on staff, throwing equipment across an open plan office space, drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, and cracking a whip near colleagues' faces.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, Ubisoft apologised to "everyone affected" by the reported harassment and abuse, and announced plans to audit "our existing policies, processes, and systems to understand where these have broken down, and to ensure we can better prevent, detect, and punish inappropriate behaviour." In November 2021, current and former Ubisoft staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-employee-group-launch-petition-seeking-public-support-for-demands">launched a public petition</a> condemning the company for a lack of meaningful or transparent progress on this front.</p>
<p>In 2022, CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-ceo-defends-company-against-criticism-of-reforms-but-campaigners-demand-deeper-change/">responded</a> to criticism of Ubisoft's efforts to make amends by saying "we have done a lot and I think we are a company that can be proud of itself", pointing to the swift dismissal of certain reported offenders, including Patrux. Ubisoft have yet to respond to this week's revelations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Get yer flip-flops out and dust last year's sand off the boogie board. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s world map will be bigger than previous games in the soaking survival series. At least that's what the developers say in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">a recent Q &amp; A video</a>. They've also said they're returning to the storytelling style of the first game, with a silent protagonist and "player discovery" being the big driver of the story. </p>

<p>"The playable map size will be bigger than what we originally launched in early access on the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and even Below Zero's early access release," says creative producer Scott MacDonald in the video. "But just how big and how deep you'll be able to go over the course of early access, we're not exactly sure yet."</p>
<p>"The entire world is being handcrafted by a talented team of world designers and environment artists," he said, "and they're pouring everything into the world right now. We're aiming for this to be the biggest and most exciting Subnautica game ever once we hit 1.0 in a few years time."</p>
<p>It's not totally surprising for Unknown Worlds to go bigger for the sequel. But outright saying so may be reassuring to those players who complained that Below Zero's map felt smaller and shallower than the original survival splashabout. One player, for example, made comparison images to show <a href="https://imgur.com/xewdhVK">the difference in map size between games</a>.</p>

<p>I wasn't that bothered, to be honest. Much of the first game's map is open expanse and empty ocean - good for evoking a sense of vastness but not necessarily required in Below Zero's frosty ice fields.  The cold spinoff was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-below-zero-review">beautiful and inviting</a>, even if all the bitter snowstorms raged in a tighter space. But hey, I get why people are endlessly hungry for more watery depths to explore. The original Subnautica remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. </p>
<p>The devs cover some other common queries. They say a lot of players want to go back to the environmental storytelling basics of the first game. So the game is "returning to having a silent protagonist", rather than a tailored protagonist as in Below Zero. "But that doesn't mean that we won't have the opportunity to showcase some amazing voice acting in PDA entries and in other areas," says MacDonald. </p>
<p>But not everything is returning to tradition. The vehicles you'll get here won't include the nippy Seamoth submersible or hulking Cyclops submarine from the first game, we're told, because the team want to make "new vehicles that are designed in the same spirit, just more suited to the brand new environment". Meanwhile full character customisation won't be available from the first moments of early access, they say, but it will get added later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
