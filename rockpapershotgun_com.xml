            <p>Sellers of revamped retro PC games and also newer PC games GOG have been accused of using AI-generated artwork to promote their store's new year sale. Meanwhile, a job listing the Polish company have recently posted for a senior software engineer to work on their desktop app <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gog-galaxy">GOG Galaxy</a> lists among the role's responsibilities that they must "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the alleged use of AI art first, that was spotted by Reddit users and subsequently reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">GamingOnLinux</a>. The artwork in question appears to be the New Year Sale header which - as of writing - is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/new-year-sale">still up on GOG's storefront</a>, and does feature some weird blurring towards the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Discussion of the artwork on the GOG forums has garnered <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69/?staff=yes">a response</a> from a user with the handle KosmicznaPluskwa, who appears to be a senior graphic designer on the GOG team. Declaring that they're "not a company spokesperson" and were only offering a personal opinion, they wrote: "To clear the air - current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work.</p>
<p>"This is all I can say on this," KosmicznaPluskwa continued. "My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be - it's possible to find job offers descriptions from less than a year ago and 5+ years ago to compare, if anyone is curious."</p><p>If you do go looking through GOG's job listings, you'll find a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy">recently posted one</a> for a senior software engineer on GOG Galaxy. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/hooray-linux-is-gogs-next-major-frontier-oh-no-it-wants-to-actively-use-and-promote-ai-assisted-development-tools/">Please Call Gamer</a>, the gig's requirements include "active use of AI tools in daily development workflows, and enthusiasm for helping the team increase adoption". Furthermore, the day-to-day reponsibilities section mentions a need to "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools to increase team efficiency and code quality."</p>
<p>I've reached out to GOG for comment about both the artwork and the job listing.</p>
<p>All of this follows GOG changing ownership just before 2025 morphed into 2026, with Witcher developers CD Projekt opting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">sell the storefront to original GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński</a> in a deal worth about £18.6 million. To this point, Kiciński's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">making a lot of reassuring noises</a> about GOG's future direction and plans, conveying a desire to grow while sticking to the platform's established preservation and anti-DRM strengths. Needless to say that I don't recall any chatter about aiming to do a bunch of AI bollocks as part of that.</p>
