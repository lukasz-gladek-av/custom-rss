            <p>
Sega have gotten just a little bit too good at making Sonic games. Not good as in 10/10 masterpieces, good as in competent, as in mostly jank free, and where there is jank it's the annoying, not very funny kind. I like it when the blue hedgehog is impossible to control in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> actually! But look, when I go on to tell you about a game that captures that same unruly spirit of Sega's early 3D games, please ignore that Christmas was a month ago because SantaCorps 4 is a 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> that really does have the messy, gloopy sauce.
</p>
<p>
First order of business: no, to my knowledge there are not three other SantaCorps games you've never heard of, though there is another one called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398700/SantaCorps_Snow_Patrol/">SantaCorps: Snow Patrol</a> that's very much a Bombermanish, arcadey type situation that may also be worth checking out. SantaCorps 4 sees you playing as a member of the titular SantaCorps, all because Kris Kringle himself ain't doing so hot, and it's up to you/them to save Christmas. Standard!

Essentially what you're trying to do from level to level is rack up a whole bunch of points. To do this, you can dash about the place at ridiculous speeds, zipping through stars to collect points a la Sonic doing a ring dash, climbing down chimneys to deliver presents, lighting up Christmas trees, all while trying to maintain your ridiculously fast pace to keep your combo going. It's maybe even too fast! And you can't control the camera! But it's also just a lighthearted bit of fun, there's nothing pressuring you to do good, just an encouraging hand pushing you towards mach five.
</p><p>
It is also cheap as chips, or at least as much as a bougie coffee, so if you're in the mood for some silly, speedy fun, even if it is seasonally inappropriate, you can pick it up on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398530/SantaCorps_4/">here</a>. Oh, and there's co-op too! What more could you want?

            <p>
It is inevitable that when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> rocks up, is really good, and makes a gazillion dollars, that there will be the odd imitator here and there. Sincerity, flattery, yada, yada, yada, point is, it's all fine as long as you at least put enough of a twist in there to make it more of an "influenced by" over a "wholesale ripoff" kind of thing. I think Gambonanza, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilding chess game, fits into the former quite nicely.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not going to explain chess to you, you already know how that works. How Gambonanza works is that instead of the usual 8x8 grid, it has a much smaller 5x5 one. When you start a run, you have just three lowly pawns to work with. Your goal is to capture all of the enemy pieces, which are randomised per run, and if a pawn manages to reach the other end of the board it gets a promotion, i.e. you can turn it into a rook, knight, queen or other pieces. But the Balatro of it all are perks you can acquire called Gambits.
</p>
<p>
These are essentially the equivalent of Balatro's Joker cards, modifiers that can aid you in your quest to chess. For example, one Gambit allows you to skip your opponent's turn if you manage to capture an opposing piece with a pawn. Another Gambit earns you a king piece upon earning a promotion, which, as a point, you can also have a team full of kings, if you can get that many - as long as you have no more than three per round.
</p>
<p>
Beating a round earns you money, money lets you buy gambits or more pieces, you can continue to see the Balatro comparison in its meta strategic elements, but ultimately you're still playing Chess. Well, chess where there are boss battles, and pieces that have extraneous effects like tiles disappearing when your opponent captures one of your pieces, so not exactly chess, but you get what I mean.
</p><p>
It's all quite neat and satisfying, there isn't the overwhelming sensation of stress that comes from playing actual chess, the Gambits feel useful, and you can only have five of them so no overpowered runs for you. It's chess Balatro! And there's nothing wrong with that. If you'd like to have a go yourself, then you can head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509230/Gambonanza/">Steam page</a> to try out its current playtest.
