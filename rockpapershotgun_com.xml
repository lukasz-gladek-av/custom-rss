I had Hell Is Us vaguely pegged as an "arty" game, but then I watched the new release date trailer, which begins with Adam Jensen('s voice actor) grizzly-grunting that "when the fury of emotions sparks the wildfire of violence, it dissolves our illusions and exposes the fragile structure of reality". And I realised that, no, this is some glorious nonsense. Maximum ham. High-concept cheeseville. Pseudostravaganza. I mean all these phrases as compliments. Come now - let your illusions dissolve as the fragile structure of your reality is exposed by the wildfire violence of this furious trailer!

<p>
In less excitable language, Hell Is Us is a third-person action-adventure with a mix of melee combat featuring lightsabers and drones, exploration featuring a mix of rundown military and otherworldly architecture, and narrative sequences featuring fellahs with flappy double chins.</p>
<p>You play Rémi, who is voiced by the afore-referenced Elias Toufexis, and is on "a quest to find his origins in a country" both "ravaged by civil war" and full of "supernatural creatures reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments". The game is the work of Rogue Factor with Nacon publishing, and its creative and artistic director is no less a lofty luminary than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. 
</p>
<p>
It looks a bit like a weaponised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, with notes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Tom Clancy. It's also got something called "player-plattering", which I don't entirely understand.
</p>
<p>
"Through its Player-Plattering approach incentivizing players to follow their instincts rather than markers, the title aims to return to the roots of adventure games," the press release explains. "It encourages reflection and observation by eliminating all forms of intrusive assistance." Is this some kind of minimal-output HUD mode, perhaps? The term "plattering" makes me feel like I'm going to be eating other players for dinner. Which I guess would be an intriguing mechanic.</p>
<p>Oh hang on, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-is-us-wants-to-make-its-action-adventuring-more-old-school-than-elden-ring">spoke to Jacques-Belletête about player-plattering in 2022</a>. And yes, it appears to be about allowing players to navigate and explore with reference to things and people within the world, rather than forcing you to use a magic mapping tool or follow a breadcrumb trail.
</p>
<p>
We'll find out for sure on 4th September 2025. Always happy to see Eliax Toufexis in a starring role, simply because he has such overt Main Character Voice that it confuses and alarms me when I find him playing a side character in other games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.

            <p>Ex Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-blasts-fake-lawsuits-against-us-and-riot-games-claiming-union-workers-used-harassment-claims-to-drum-up-members">recent comments on the Grit podcast</a> regarding "fake lawsuits" brought against Activision Blizzard around 2021 are "false", "insulting" to alleged victims, and "unsurprising", a spokesperson for the Communication Workers Of America (CWA) has told RPS.</p>
<p>Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of "fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren't true," claiming his former company was "targeted" by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.</p>

<p>"The claims Bobby Kotick presents in the podcast regarding the “fake lawsuits” are false," the CWA spokesperson told RPS in an emailed statement that includes links to past correspondence and reporting. "In 2021, Activision agreed to an $18 million dollar settlement with the EEOC following a lawsuit that Activision had sexually harassed and discriminated against its workforce. <a href="https://investor.activision.com/node/34481/pdf">Bobby Kotick himself apologized in his own press release</a> for the inappropriate conduct that happened under his watch."</p>
<p>"Alongside the settlement money, Activision also agreed to provide anti-harassment and anti-discrimination trainings, expand mental health counseling services to its workers, and provide victim-specific relief, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/court-approves-eeocs-18-million-settlement-activision-blizzard">EEOC’s release</a> on March 3, 2022."</p>
<p>"Subsequently, in 2023, <a href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/2023/12/15/civil-rights-department-announces-settlement-agreement-to-resolve-employment-discrimination-and-equal-pay-lawsuit-against-activision-blizzard/">Activision reached a $54 million dollar settlement</a> with the California Civil Rights Department (which was formerly known as the California State Department of Fair Employment and Housing, as Kotick references in the podcast) for discriminating against women in the workplace and for pay inequities."</p>
<p>For additional context: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">following the settlement</a>, the state department said that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard". In a comment made to RPS at the time, Activision Blizzard spokesperson added that "the CRD (previously DFEH) has acknowledged that no court or independent investigation substantiated any allegations that 'Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors, including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.'” Kotick himself has denied any personal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"Bobby Kotick’s comments on a podcast uplifting billionaires are both insulting to the Activision workers who <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-allegations-of-rampant-sexism/">spoke out about the harassment they faced</a> and unsurprising," the CWA say in their statement about Kotick's claims this week. "Fortunately for workers, Kotick is gone and thousands of workers have organized unions with CWA without intimidation or interference and now have a voice at work."</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">our interview on how the CWA helps developers unionise</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA's comment to RPS, the ABK Worker's Alliance - a union made up of Activision Blizzard King employees - has <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1889787591056052523">responded publicly to Kotick's podcast allegations via social media</a>. "The trauma, discrimination, and abuse that our coworkers and former coworkers endured is not fake or a 'plan to drive union membership'," reads a tweet from last night. "Our unions were born from the very real and harmful way executives reacted when made aware of these situations."</p>
<p>"The executives of our company did not protect us, and often made the situation worse or directly perpetuated the harm," they continue. "That is why we decided to stand up for ourselves and make our company better, a place where we truly lived by our core values and looked out for one another."</p>
<p>"A common misinformation tactic used by companies during a union campaign is to assert that a union is a third party that comes in and makes changes," the ABK union statement goes on. "This is not true. The workers are the union."</p>
<p>"We are not a third party looking for companies to prey on. We are workers with a vested interest in making our company the best it can be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-developers-warn-fans-to-watch-out-for-a-fraudulent-playtest">fish puns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-is-powerwash-simulator-for-holes">naughty jokes about holes</a> to warn you that a huge chunk of celestial debris <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2025/02/07/nasa-continues-to-monitor-orbit-of-near-earth-asteroid-2024-yr4/">has a 2.3% chance of impacting Earth in December 2032</a> and wiping out the city of Bradford. I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_YR4">Asteroid 2024 YR4</a> loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.
</p>
<p>
If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool <a href="https://neal.fun/asteroid-launcher/">Asteroid Launcher</a>, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
YR24 is said to be 130-300 feet across, and is made of stone. Let’s split the difference and say it’s 215 feet across, or a few short of 70 metres. According to Asteroid Launcher, if a 70 metre wide stone asteroid were to explode in the atmosphere 2.4 kilometres above my flat*, while travelling at 17 kilometres a second, the devastation would be catastrophic. The resulting 211 decibel shockwave would totally obliterate my favourite chippie down the road. My local Cafe Neros at the bottom of the hill would experience winds faster than the storms on Jupiter. My favourite curry shop in London would likely be levelled, which I guess is fine because I think they’re planning to move anyway. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds unbearable, but it could be worse. My favourite London takeaway joint would fall slightly outside the blast radius, and people eating in my favourite vegan pizza place might not even glance up from their Pepper-no-nis. Curiously, if the asteroid were 30 metres bigger, big enough to make landfall, the area-of-effect would apparently be smaller and the casualties, fewer, give or take a few extra from earthquakes. I can’t remotely speak to the accuracy of whatever science Asteroid Launcher runs on. I’m fairly sure it’s not a standard reporting tool at any major space agency. If it is, we have more immediate problems to worry about than YR24.
</p>
<p>
What drives somebody to read about an extremely unlikely asteroid impact and immediately load up a free browser game in order to simulate their own destruction? I don’t know, but it’s an instinct that informs a lot of video games. Patient zero could be the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. We’ve all had that moment in SimCity, right, when the infrastructure is humming and all your residential, industrial and commercial zones are in perfect equilibrium, and a rasping voice in your ear says “Screw it – die, you pack of filthy little law-abiding conformists”, and you push the Godzilla button.</p>
<p>It’s the same nihilism that flowers within my spleen when I read the label on a bottle of shower gel made by a company that whimsically declares its boss to be “Nature”. Video games are great at venting such feelings, which is perhaps less constructive when it means, say, dissipating pent-up anguish about climate change, but surely forgiveable enough when it comes to the fickle motions of marauding space rocks.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you need a pick-me-up after reading all that, I recommend sumptuous planet-nurser <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a>. Oh look, it was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/499436070246548643?l=english">recently updated</a>! With a selection of… natural disasters.

            <p>The flash flood of marketing that poured forth from PlayStation's State Of Play last night splashes wetly upon we PC players too. Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will <em>not</em> release. And that's mildly interesting.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is coming out September 23rd, as celebrated by the maniacally cackling mascot at the end of the trailer. The lootsy shootsy was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-looks-ready-to-drop-the-hottest-memes-of-2011-in-first-look-trailer">announced shortly before Christmas</a> last year, and will have the usual 4-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, random weapons, and sense of "humour". This time your team of lootbox addicts will be battling "the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high."</p>
<p>So, Borderlands again. Still, there's a fun bit of obvious deduction to glean here. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick reassured shareholders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">an earnings call</a> last week that the company was confident they were giving enough space to their big releases. That's to be expected, publishers like to space out their games for maximum sales. All of which suggests GTA 6 probably won't hit the shelves in September. Or at least the weeks around Borderlands 4 will be a big buffer zone. Zelnick himself has twice confirmed the open world crim sim is on-target for an autumn 2025 release. </p>
<p>It's fun to speculate that the other big games of the season are playing "release date chicken" because of Grand Theft Auto 6, which still hasn't announced when it will arrive to nuke all the other games released that week from orbit. But studios can always reschedule once they see it coming, and some game buyers don't care about GTA at all. Still, it feels like Take-Two has eliminated at least a couple of possible weeks from the guessing game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a> studio Housemarque sound like they're aiming to put more emphasis on the <em>lite </em>part of the roguelite formula with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, their next loop 'em up space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> arriving exclusive to PlayStation 5 next year and likely on PC sometime after that, if past time loops are anything to go on.</p>

If you missed that one, it was a third person shooter with roguelite and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> elements that stood out from the pack through incredibly nifty gunfeel and enemy design, and a pretty singular atmosphere of sci-fi tinged dread. It was, dare I say, cosmic horror done right.</p>
<p>That said, it could also be very punishing until you got your bearings, which I imagine put some folks off early. Saros is aiming to do things <em>a little differently</em>. I can't write "a little differently" without my internal monologue making it sound like it's written in cool guy voice with The Fonz fingers. It is actually a little different though. From the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/">PlayStation blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is permanent resources and progression making every death valuable. After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to “come back stronger” to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roguelite meta progression?! Surely no valued RPS commenters will have strong and often insightful opinions on <em>that</em> universally good design feature!</p>
<p>It took the original Returnal a couple of years to come to PC. Sony have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-have-bought-housemarque-developers-of-returnal-and-nex-machina">scooped up Housemarque since then</a>, so whether this complicates matters I'm not sure. Sony have talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-may-invest-more-in-its-efforts-to-bring-playstation-games-to-pc">focusing more on PC in the past</a>, and we've seen previously exclusive titles hit Steam with increasing frequency lately. They also finally dropped that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">pesky PSN account requirement last month</a>. Oh, and do play Housemarque's other game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nex-machina">Nex Machina</a> if you haven't, it's excellent.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>
