            <p>It'll soon be time for another season of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the super-duper Overwotlike and thirsty delivery vehicle for every variation of Marvel character known to the human mind. What's coming in season three? Wesley Snipes and a bloody great burning bird lady. By which I mean, Blade and Phoenix. They'll be matching wits with Hera, goddess of death, who has palled up with Knull, god of symbioties, aka the wriggly black pyjamas sported by Venom.</p>
<p>All of this may seem frightening and bizarre if you're here because you accidentally hit auto-complete while googling "Marks &amp; Spencers opening times", so here's a swift trailer to fill you in.</p><!--more-->

<p>How about that? Nicely surgical bit of techno, I thought, definitely has me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZuZZzvJxR8">itching for the dance floor</a>. The new season begins on 11th July. Here's some official blurb for that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar's core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos. Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night."</p> </blockquote>
<p>"As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?" the trailer blurb concludes. I choose to translate this as: do you want Phoenix Force skins or Symbiote skins? As for how the new characters play, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/massive-marvel-rivals-leak-confirms-season-3-theme-with-new-hero-battle-pass-and-more/">leaks suggest</a> that they're both DPS roles. There's also talk of new hero team-ups and some "anti-heal" mechanics, given away by new voice lines. It's probable one of the new heroes has the power to shut down health replenishment.</p>
<p>We've not covered Marvel Rivals much lately due to a shortage of hands at the wheel and greymass for the ever-expanding hero roster. It remains a popular game, with 56,735 people playing at the time of writing.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-and-phoenix-are-coming-to-marvel-rivals-this-july-in-season-3-along-with-rumoured-anti-heal-mechanics]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There are times in all of our lives when we not only feel compelled to try something new, but burn with an irrepressible desire to break free from the chains of our mundane misery by experiencing a thing which we've not yet experienced.</p>
<p>For some people, that thing might be skydiving or baking a pistachio layer cake with cream cheese buttercream. For me, at one point last year, it was to watch the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit. For Hideo Kojima, developer of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, it is to go to space, and make a game in space. Please, someone just stick him in a rocket already.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I make this plea following Mr Kojima's recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2">The Guardian</a>, in which he once again voiced a desire to go to space and then make a game while in space. He's wanted this, or some variation of it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-wants-someone-to-send-him-to-space-so-he-can-make-a-game-to-play-in-space">for</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/hey-jeff-bezos-send-hideo-kojima-to-space-already/">years</a>.</p>
<p>People keep putting microphones and bits of paper in front of him, and he keeps telling them he wants it soooooooooo badly. Then, we all go 'Oh aye Hideo, you're so quirky' and move on.</p>
<p>"I want to train properly, learn how to do the docking, go to the International Space Station and stay there for a few months," the space-starved soul said in this latest instance of cosmic craving, "I’m not a scientist, but I could probably make games in space. I want to be the first. There are a lot of astronauts over 60, so I guess it’s possible."</p>
<p>He also mentioned in this interview that he's suffering from, er, "Tom Cruise disease". Basically, he wants to risk his life in a way that would give him a feeling of really being alive. Sounds very Breaking Bad, and I'll be honest, it's underlined the seriousness of the situation in my eyes.</p>
<p>We need to get this man up there to space. I don't care how it goes, whether it ends well for Kojima or not. We know he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">prepared for the worst</a>. He wants it so badly that we desperately need to let him eff around, so he can finally find out. Maybe it won't be all he's imagined it to be. Maybe he'll come running back to Earth and spend long evenings whispering to Geoff Keighley and several famous acting people about how much of a letdown it was.</p>
<p>The worst part is, given how long Kojima's been saying this stuff, we clearly can't rely on the governments or billionaires who currently have access to spacecraft or the means to send people up there to accomplish it.</p>
<p>There's only one solution I can see. If we all stand on each other's shoulders, and I mean the entire population of the planet here, we can form a huge flesh ladder which can convey Hideo to the heavens.</p>
<p>No, before you ask, I don't volunteer to be the person at the very bottom.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A few days ago, while walking in the woods, I allowed a mosquito to suck blood from my hand for about 20 seconds. Holding my arm extended like a sweaty middle-aged messiah, I watched as the insect tapped methodically at my skin, watched as it pushed its needle nose into the flesh between my smallest knuckles, watched as its hitherto-imperceptible belly bulged and turned a shiny, jubilant red.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Later, I googled West Nile disease and felt like a fool. I'll not be making a habit of this. Still, it was fascinating to see another creature treat my blood like a resource, to see my vital fluids coalesce into a tiny crystal outside my body and fly off to (eventually) form part of some waterborne larvae, deep in the forest. If you get bitten by a mosquito near Watford in the next few days, apologies - there's a non-zero chance that was "one of mine".</p>

<p>This is my overlong, wince-worthy introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/worship">Worship</a>, a mix of Pikmin and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult Of The Lamb</a> in which you can wreak all <em>kinds</em> of havoc with your casually dispensed body fluids. Devised by Chasing Rats Games, the game casts you as a hooded zealot roaming a usefully colourless realm of warring eldritch gods. The core mechanic is slicing your hand so that you can paint the ground with your blood trail. The shapes you draw with your gore have supernatural properties.</p>
<p>Scrawl a circle around a clump of villagers and they'll be converted to your cause, their pale, unbelieving bodies turning a bold, occult black. Other shapes let you prep and fire off spells to smoosh enemy cultists and shatter obstacles. The catch, of course, is that your character will eventually run out of blood, aka life, but don't worry, you can hold a button to hoover up all of your claret doodles without, it seems, exposing yourself to a cocktail of bacterial infections. Say what you like about occultists, but they're both surprisingly hygienic and thrifty.</p>
<p>Once converted, villagers serve much the same purpose as Pikmin. You can lob them at things you want beaten up, and have them carry things such as the sinister gemstones you need to sow the land with your cursed altars. You can also slash them open and use their <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dril">victory wine</a> for sorcery, if you're feeling a touch anaemic.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1548180/Worship/">a demo for Worship</a> on Steam. The full game - out 16th July 2025 - includes four-player support, and I will absolutely give a prize to whichever co-op team can write out the URL for the UK government advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-bite-avoidance-for-travellers">mosquito bite avoidance</a> in their own gore.
