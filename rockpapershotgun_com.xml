            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is still set for release sometime this year, and our Ziffly chums at Ian Games have gone got their hands on 11 minutes of exclusive footage from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. That video is below. Watch it in isolation for a guaranteed blissful Reuben-free experience, or keep scrolling to read my awful opinions. Spoiler warning for one small part of one quest, and opinion warning now: I, uh, I don't love it!</p>

<p>The clip kicks off mid-quest. We're on what looks like a mining planet, all sandstone cliffs and crystalline bunches. Indulging in a little showcasey arsenal appreciation, we admire our knife, a slimy slime pistol, and a glowing Toys R Us does Art Deco Scythe. Art Deco's the theme, actually. We soon approach an open plaza overlooked by a mythologising mural that evokes similar art from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a>'s Talos I.</p>
<p>"Everything must become nothing, before it can become everything," blasts a tannoy. Distinctly meaningless middle management motivational slogan tier as far as proclamations of evil go, that, but I don't mind a "we must first punch the world to bits before making it good" villain, done well. We sneak up through the plaza, followed by our companion Aza. She's also a cultist, and she keeps calling the other cultists "traitors". We approach an enemy, select our knife, and Aza says "It's killing time!". That is my third least favourite thing a companion can say, Aza.</p>
<p>We stealth stab one cultist, but their body is immediately spotted by another. No matter! We have guns, grenades, and slo-mo - a combination that makes us too pathologically impatient to wait for grenades to create an honest god-fearing explosion on their own time, and so we shoot ours mid-air. Yep, that'll do it. A bit more shooting, and we're inside.</p>
<p>We follow bloody footprints inside the building until we meet a science lady named Exemplar Foxworth. We can immediately tell she's a science lady because she starts breathlessly babbling calculations, as all good pop culture scientists are contractually obligated to do. Whoa! Slow down there, braniac! Can you say that again….<em>in English!</em> She's been left bleeding out via slapdash exsanguination, but it looks like we either don't have high enough medical skills or a kit to patch her up. Conversational skill checks, check.</p>
<p>She fills you in on the situation. The cult has been going billy bear blood sausage nutso around the facility. "Is there any science around here we use to find and kill them?", asks your companion, quirkaciously. What a delightful whackadoodle whose shtick certainly was not worn out halfway through her very first sentence. Science lady points you to a scanner to locate the invisible cultists. She calls them "visibility impaired".</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry. Just headbutted my keyboard six times in a row then blacked out for a moment. We pass over some electrified corridors and locate the scanner in another room. It's a mask that, indeed, reveals the cultists through infra-red bug vision. We find a few cultists and whack them with the Toys R Us scythe, which looks nicely chunky. "Homicide always cheers me up!", says Aza, evidently unsatisfied with only coming third on my shit list previously.</p>
<p>We return to science lady for some more advice on opening some doors, solve a lever puzzle, then it's off to locate and kill a cultist named Victor. Before that, we take a quick jaunt to show off killable NPCs by putting an end to science lady's calculations for good. Murderable everyone, check. Murderable everyone as a crowdpleasing feature without the branching quest design that would make that feature interesting to begin with? Unconfirmed!</p>
<p>And that's curtains, or hastily shut blinds anyway. Well! I like the art direction. The melee combat looks neat. But can I bank on these enough to buy me a fresh pair of unground teeth each time a character opens their mouths? Starting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">miss Avowed already, honestly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The years pass and the animals perish and the oceans rise and the wealth gap widens and I repeatedly think to myself through a fug of nitrogen oxide, Steam discounts and microplastic sediment, “man, those Oddworld games were excellent, weren’t they”. If you've yet to have the pleasure, you can scoop up the entirety of the squalid anti-capitalist satire universe on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXjw3">Fanatical</a> right now for a pound or dollar. It's been a while since I read Theses on Feuerbach, but I'm pretty sure that counts as praxis?

Released in 1997 for Personable Computers and the PlayableStation, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a> is the story of a Mudokon meat factory worker with his mouth sewn shut who overhears plans to convert the entire workforce into popsicles. It’s a single-screen 2D platformer in which your skills consist of jumping, pulling levers, communicating by means of a once-touted GameSpeak system, farting, and praying.</p>

<p>Oh, how you’ll pray, for you have all the offensive capacity and resilience of a McDonalds salad. Threats include gun-toting Sligs and their miniature T-Rex guard dogs, handsy herds of Paramites, and the viciously territorial Scrabs. The nearest you get to fighting back is possessing the bodies of other creatures and making use of their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Survival rests on manipulating the puzzle-game workings of each screen so as to bypass or isolate dangers, often by the skin of your teeth.  Death is frequent, and gruesomely funny. Abe might be gaming’s ultimate fallguy. Also funny: watching a crowd of Mudokons squeakily tip-toe past a sleeping sentry. Aside from getting the hell out of Rupture Farms, the game calls on you to play a mixture of local messiah and union organiser – commanding and guiding your fellow labourers to mystic portals formed by flocks of birds, while trying not to get them mulched, eaten, blown up, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-exoddus">Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</a> is in some ways a remake, fleshing out the Mudokon communication aspect and turning in a grander plot involving a ghastly new mind-altering soft drink. Mudokons now have emotional states - they'll get angry, wired, depressed or sick, which means you now have to worry about your allies running around giggling or getting into possibly-fatal slapfights. I think Exoddus is the better game than Oddysee, the one they really wanted to make, but they’re both excellent, with tumid, desolate industrial environments made up of pipes and chasms and LED displays.</p>
<p>The later Oddworld games are more of a mixture. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is the standout, a cult Wild Western shooter in which your bullets are squirming critters. Oddworld: Munch's Oddyssey is an imperfect departure into full 3D platforming. I never got round to playing the 2.5D series reboot <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-soulstorm">Oddworld: Soulstorm</a>, but I hear it's a bit ropey.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I need a new Oddworld game right now, but I’d like to play more games that recall this particular blend of gallows humour, apocalyptic gloom and ingenuity. If you’d like to recommend an Oddworld spiritual successor, I’m all ears.
