            <p>Bungie have broken a silence surrounding their upcoming extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> to tweet <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722">a short video full of cryptic symbols</a>. It's proven hard for fans to decrypt so far, but the developers have since followed up with a few more teasey posts, including one that certainly reads like a notice to fans that more information on the game will be revealed soon. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming," says a line of plain text in the marketing spritz. "Are you ready?" </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first post on Xitter to send fans into a flap was that spliced video of various symbols swishing around. Some users think you have to <a href="https://x.com/johnotron604/status/1907862522490769613">cut up the video</a> and piece it back together correctly before attempting to decode the symbols' meanings. But most of the Xitterati just immediately gave up and asked the social media's built-in AI Grok what the video meant. Grok didn't know. It said the post <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1907844677363011806">was marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the studio's social media account shared more. It posted an animation showing a code being slowly decrypted, while warning of an <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907931118780788824">"unauthorized transmission"</a>. Alongside this was a link to an ARG website with a Twitch login. Currently the Twitch login just brings you to a page saying "Access Denied". It all basically looks like a fancy and playful way of saying "broadcast incoming", but who knows.  </p>
<p>Finally, the most recent post shows another animated image, depicting <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602">a snake with a written message alongside</a>. "The signal bleeds through their jamming," it reads. "Symbols not random. Not accident. Not noise. But VOICE." It compels the reader to "decrypt decrypt decrypt" and ends with a final hypey warning. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming. Are you ready? RISE RISE RISE."</p>

<p>Bungie have been fond of these ARG marketing tactics since the days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>. The last concrete news we got of Marathon was in a brief video from game director Joe Ziegler in which he reassured everyone that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">the game was still alive</a>. That was in October last year. He didn't share much about the actual game itself, however, beyond brief mentions of two playable character classes, one referred to as "stealth" and the other as "thief". </p>
<p>Marathon has had a troubled development so far. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people</a> last year, doubtless impacting the game's production. And director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">taken off the project</a> after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">allegations of "predatory behaviour"</a> towards several women working at the studio. Marathon will be the studio's first release since being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought by Sony in 2022</a>, and Sony have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">somewhat ruthless</a> towards the makers of live service games lately. The stakes feel quite high.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys the feel of Bungie's shooters (and who still counts the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon trilogy</a> as good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> games) I'm interested to see how this reboot might play with the extraction shooter genre. But I'm also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">like others</a>, dead tired of live service games. I think I just preferred Bungie when they made Halo. Anyway, we'll keep an eye out for more news on the feeds - both the real ones, and the ones that shout RISE at you a lot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">first big title update</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is upon us like a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles, and when I say a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles I am, of course, referring to the Mizutsune – a new Wilds monster last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>.</p>
<p>It and a new, high rank version of the Zoh Shia are the title update’s headline additions. But it’s not <em>all</em> monster hunting. There’s also a new social area, the Grand Hub, wherein you can hang with your mates, bowl exploding barrels and do some arm-wrestling. With your mates, I assume. The changelog just says "Arm Wrestling Barrel". I assume you won't be arm-wrestling a barrel. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update requires 6GB of storage space, or 16GB if you’re using the high resolution texture packs. If you’re wondering where to find the Mizutsune, you’ll need to reach Hunter Rank 21 to unlock a mission you can start by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete that mission, and the bubble-huffing rainbow lizard is yours for the slaying. There’s a Tempered version of the Mizutsune to fight after HR 41. As for the high rank Zoh Shia, you’ll need to be HR 50 to access the relevant story mission. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these munsters bring with them new weapon and armour crafting options. We can also expect new skills, status ailments, pop-up camp gear options, limited bounty categories, voice lines and poses. The Grand Hub becomes available after completing a tutorial mission that appears from HR 16.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bountiful rework indeed, with a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes to wash down the extra critters, gear and quests. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters">promised</a>, there have been some PC technical improvements as well, though it’s hard to gauge from the fleeting description just how much difference they’ll make: “Improvements were made to VRAM usage, and the DirectStorage version has been upgraded.” 
</p>

            <p>In a recent episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/f_VP86VvwDk">Quad Damage podcast</a>, Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-founder-is-open-to-the-idea-of-making-dishonored-3-just-dont-place-any-bets-on-it-actually-happening">spoke about his ideas for a new Dishonored game</a>. He, Harvey Smith, and Dinga Bakaba all had their own ideas for a sequel, he said, although the odds of any of them being developed are low as all three devs now work on different projects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the podcast, the subject turned to Colantonio's thoughts on AI and the future of immersive sims. In short, he sounds optimistic. "If AI could really remember everything, and take meaningful human decisions like a Dungeons and Dragons Gamemaster, then that would actually be very valuable. Things we could not do. There would not be a team that is big enough to do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"One of the things about immersive sims is that we are always trying, either to plan for everything that we think the player might do - and that's authoring, that's painful," Colantonio said. "Or, we're doing a lot of failsafes with systems that somehow fall back on their feet if the player does something we did not plan. There's always some stuff the players do that we haven't planned, so that's why you have the net under. But that net's a little janky. Sometimes it works, sometimes not."</p>

<p>"Everybody hates AI ... and for frankly good reasons. But there is space for AI to improve the tools," he continued.  "Not to do our job, but improve the tools. If you look at the way we made games in the nineties, it's pretty similar to how we make games today. The tools have barely evolved. I mean, they have, but it's still the same principles, the same ideas. If you need to make your level a little bigger, you still have to pull the props apart and add the middle prop that's missing there, make sure the textures match. It's an absolute pain."</p>
<p>He thinks that level designers spend a lot of time doing "grunt work", and that this could be improved if "there was an equivalent of a chatbot GPT embedded in some tools. And I'm sure it's going to happen tomorrow. You'll look at your building, and say: make it bigger. Make it wider. Change the style. And then it's done very fast. And then you become the director of that level."</p>
<p>The tools for making games Colantonio began his career with have evolved, he goes on, but not that drastically (as ever, the difficulty with genAI discussions is distinguishing between the current wave of new product announcements and older tools which make less showy use of automation and generation.) Meanwhile, team sizes and budgets <em>have</em> gone up dramatically. "We're throwing people at the problems. Making games with 1000 people doesn't make sense. It was not meant to be. There's nothing admirable about that. It's just a lot of money and a lot of people that are probably not having a fun job. I would rather go back to the way things were when teams were between 20 and 50 people."</p>
<p>WolfEye, Colantonio's current studio, indeed started with around 19 people, and now<a href="https://gamerant.com/wolfeye-studios-new-game-interview/"> sits at "50-60"</a>. They're currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">an unnamed first-person RPG</a> that harkens back to the immersive sims their alumni are famous for. "The ingenuity and gadgetry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey with a 'real <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' experience redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and modern-day Fallout."</p>
<p>I've obviously made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-some-better-terms-for-genai-output-slop-is-too-benign">my own thoughts about GenAI known</a>, but I've still got some learning to do, and there's evidently a distinction between aiding artists and trying to replace them. And, hey, call me biased, but I'm more inclined to listen to someone like Colantonio than I am some LinkedIn bozo screaming about the future without giving me a reason to care in the present. That said, I'm concerned that he's still speaking mostly speculatively here, about "space for" and "tomorrow". And the sort of people gaining wealth and power in this space between "might" and "does" aren't necessarily the ones that share Colantonio's values. If WolfEye ever decide to make a new protagonist specialise in the ol' six-finger discount, I'm going to live with the rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
