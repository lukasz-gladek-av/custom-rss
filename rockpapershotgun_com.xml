            <p>Hey, Agent 47. That's a really nice scarf. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is getting written about a lot these days so I'm seeing quite a few screenshots of buildings being blown up. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to have developed a visceral distaste for images of buildings being blown up recently. At times like these, it's nice to look at a nice scarf.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It feels grandiose and a little paranoid to relate those images of bombed-out structures to part of a larger cultural project of desensitisation, although I'm not <em>not </em>struck temporarily mute and reeling and a touch nauseous at the moment we find ourselves in, in which art about love is reframed as pornography, too vile to touch, and in which art that conjures and celebrates reminders of contemporary global suffering fades so routinely into the normal order of things. More than normal. Hot property. Hot like chapped dehydrated lips under a cruel sun. Hot like fire from the sky.</p>
<p>So, as I say, it's nice just to see a lovely scarf. Helps take the mind off things, you know?</p>
<p>I can see that you're enjoying that scarf, too, Agent 47. Don't lose focus, though. You almost missed that security camera!</p>

<p>You have to take out the cameras first, 47. It's just good business, taking out the cameras, right before you do something too vile for words. Oh, right. News. Yes. IO Interactive recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7356956984207630336">hired a new writer on World Of Asssasination</a> in former Edge editor Jen Simpkins, which likely means we'll be getting more substantial updates that I'd previously assumed, lining up with IO's promises that Hitman isn't completely wrapped up as they move on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>. This is a videogame news piece on a videogame website. You can't say it isn't.</p>
