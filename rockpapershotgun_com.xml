            <p>
I understand why walking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sims</a> aren't really a thing any more. Some of the earliest big names like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a>, and arguably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> all came at a time where indie games were growing in popularity, but were still predominantly 2D. Something simple like a walking sim is obviously quite resourceful compared to contemporary AAA games, but now the indie scene has blown up to the point where mechanics-first genres like roguelikes are dominating. Except I like walking sims! So when a game like nophenia, a walking sim where you're a wolfgirl with a flip phone exploring different dream worlds, shows up, I'm going to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
There is a real boldness to nophenia's very simple Steam page. "There is… no game," the about section explains. "You walk around and explore brutalist but also dream-like environments." Aside from that, it explains that there are dedicated "sit" and "howl" buttons because "wolfgirls are super cool" (wolfgirls are super cool), and lists out the controls. Mysterious…

<p>
Luckily, there's a (very short, I should note) demo to try out. It really is as simple as it describes, you can walk or run around, jump, but primarily you're taking in the sights. And these sights are quite lonely. There's no one else around, apart from in one dream where there is an infinitely passing train. In another dream, umbrellas strewn across a flooded road imply passersby. You let out a howl, only for it to not be reciprocated. All you can do is press forward, more so figuratively, moving from one dream to the next, taking all the time you want in each of them, unable to return to the previous one.
</p>
<p>
I like the flip phone pause menu too. There's a quality of longing in the demo for some kind of quiet, a sense of digital escape. It doesn't feel like an accident that you start in a messy bedroom with a boarded up door, the main source of light coming from a computer, the current source of all evil in this world. There's a photo mode too, and while aesthetically you're not using your flip phone, that's obviously the vibe, with the screenshots it produces outputting at a measly but nostalgic 640x480p.
</p><p>
Everything nophenia has going for it makes a strong argument for the value of walking sims. They're a genre that forces us to take our time, slow down a little, stay with our thoughts, and that seems to come through thematically here as well.
</p>
<p>
What other dreams nophenia might hold, I look forward to seeing whenever it arrives in early 2026. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3979330/nophenia/">here</a>.

            <p>
Crikey, it's been a long time coming, but it looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> is finally coming to a close… next year. Up until earlier this week, the fifth and final episode of The Long Dark's Wintermute DLC was due to be released by the end of the year. As you've probably gathered, the end of the year is very close now, so as a result, episode five has been delayed, but it is a delay that at least comes with a concrete release date.
</p>
<p>
The release date in question is March 31st, 2026, about four months away. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hinterland">Hinterland</a> Studio explained the delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">Steam post</a> thusly: "While the majority of the episode content is now finished, there was just no way for us to wrap up the remaining cinematic work, the soundtrack, or complete the last bit of mission polish in time for the end of this year as we had originally planned. So we’re taking a couple of extra months to finish that work, then to optimize, fix the bugs, and get it ready for console certification and launch for the end of March."

<p>
With this delay and formal release date announcement came a new trailer too, showing off bits and pieces of what you can expect from episode five, which is titled The Light at the End of All Things. A bit of a wordy title, but, I suppose it goes with the emotional angle the trailer went for. It's just a lot of shots of scenery you'll presumably experience with a melancholic voice over, like a town next to a frozen lake, a boat at night time while an aurora borealis shines above, and some kind of radar station. The last bit of dialogue you hear is "nothing lasts forever," which, sheesh, that's a real bummer my guy!
</p><p>
In any case, while this might be the end of The Long Dark, it's not the end of The Long Dark (the series). About a year ago Hinterlands announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-2-announced-with-co-op-multiplayer-new-urban-areas-and-sanity-system">working on a sequel</a>, called Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 (can't tell you why Blackfrost isn't a subtitle, seems bad for branding, but what do I know). This one will feature things like co-op multiplayer, some urban areas, and a sanity system, so if this last episode of The Long Dark doesn't scratch certain itches for you, it's possible its sequel will.

            <p>
When I first caught a very quick glimpse at Into the Fire, the kind of glimpse where you more just see a character design amidst a bunch of fire, I thought it was a new simulation game. A fireman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>, that kind of thing, the kind of game I'm sure exists already without needing to Google it. Into the Fire is not that at all. There is fire, and there is rescue, but there are also ancient mysteries amongst natural disasters, fiery, destructive jellyfish-esque spirits, and a tantalizing mix of science-fiction, folklore, and the supernatural.
</p>
<p>
Remember The Invincible? Well, Into the Fire is from the same devs, and while our newly anointed editorial director Julian had some misgivings about The Invincible in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">review</a> at the time, my curiosity with Starward Industries' next has still been piqued. Details are quite light on who you are in Into the Fire, apart from the fact that you're a "bold explorer struggling to survive during a volcanic eruption on Dante’s Archipelago." Hang on… have we got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-maiden-makes-a-compelling-case-for-mixing-hades-vampire-survivors-anime-and-uh-dantes-divine-comedy">yet another</a> Divine Comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">adaptation</a> on our hands here? I suppose time will tell.
</p>
<p>
The core loop appears to be this: there is a hub, seemingly nearish to said volcano, where you can do bits of crafting and upgrading, rest a bit, find some lore, and choose your equipment before heading out on missions. Your equipment looks like quite standard firefighting stuff, like a big ole axe, and a fire extinguisher attached to your back that you spray across fires to put them out.
</p>
<p>
For the missions themselves, things look tricky, based on the game's latest trailer (as seen above). There's those aforementioned sort of jellyfish fire spirits you have to fend off, amongst others for one. But there's also the rescuing people. This isn't like, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, where you can foist them on your backpack, you actually have to carry them, and that might mean across thin planks of wood above a burning pit. Amongst the action it looks like there is a borderline puzzley navigational element that'll put your quick mapping skills and reflexes to the test.
</p><p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this game other than sometime in 2026, but whenever it does launch it'll do so in early access. In the meantime, you can wishlist Into the Fire here if it takes your fancy.

All that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">trouble going on with Monster Hunter Wilds</a> aside, for a good long while now Capcom has been doing quite well for itself. Multiple quite well liked Resident Evil games, fresh new bits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and even a few remasters, namely for the Ace Attorney games (throw a dog a bone and give us a new one of those, though Capcom), but also for series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising</a> that also haven't had a new entry in a while. Well, for now at least, as a new report suggests a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> might be in our future.
</p>
<p>
This comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">MP1ST</a>, whose sources have informed them of a new Dead Rising game that's supposedly been in the works since at least 2024 with the codename Rec. According to the report, protagonist of the first game Frank West will be making a return, with the belief being that it's a direct sequel to the first entry - MP1ST notes they couldn't completely confirm this part, however, so it could still be a completely new game.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other details MP1St are more confident in, the game will apparently be set in Hollywood, specifically on a big, enclosed movie studio lot. The villain of the game is supposedly a film director that forces Frank, amongst others, into completing different trials for the purpose of making his "perfect movie."
</p>
<p>
There wasn't any word on a release date, it's worth noting, so you should probably still expect it to be a while away. And, with all rumours, take it with a good pinch of salt. If Capcom are working on a new Dead Rising, though, I'll be curious to see how it lands. The original series was self-indulgent in a way that felt very of its time - the remaster of the first one, for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-rising-remaster-no-longer-gives-you-points-for-erotica-creepshots-because-its-not-required-or-appropriate">doesn't give you points for "Erotica" creepshots</a> on the grounds of not being "required" or "appropriate", a clear sign of different times. Perhaps we need to think more deeply about the unceremonious slaughtering of zombies more too! For now, time will tell whether this rumour comes true.

            <p>
Right now, Team Cherry's future is pretty unclear. There is some kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> DLC that'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">coming somewhere along the line</a>, but understandably the developer is keeping their cards close to their chest in terms of what's actually next. They certainly do have some ideas on how they would expand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, i.e. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-well-ever-get-another-hollow-knight-but-if-we-do-you-can-expect-them-to-be-as-standalone-as-silksong">by not making any direct sequels</a>, much like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> isn't one. But in a recent interview, Team Cherry spoke (ever so slightly) more openly about their own future and how the thing that might get in their way most is, well, death.
</p>
<p>
Lead dev's Ari Gibson and William Pellen were asked about, unsurprisingly, all things Hollow Knight in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, notably how they're planning to allocate their time post Silksong. "We do have other games that we plan to make. The only time concern really is - and we’ve talked about this before - death," Gibson explained. "It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy."
</p>
<p>
Obviously quite a morbid sentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies">one a number of devs seem to be thinking about as they get older</a>, although it's what Gibson says about future, hypothetical, non-Hollow Knight games that interests me: "We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with."
</p>
<p>
I find that particular thought process about Team Cherry's work curious, as it's very much the framework of an auteur. You can see this kind of thing in Hidetaka Miyazaki's games at FromSoftware, there are obvious, thematic connections between his games, even if staff may change between them, and it's those thematic connections that I'd be more curious to see in a future, non-Hollow Knight Team Cherry game.
</p><p>
When asked if they're sick of working on Hollow Knight, Gibson said that wasn't the case "at all," and they'd be happy to work on another one if forced to. On the other side, they'd also be interested in exploring their usual tastes but in a "slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with."
</p>
<p>
I'm always quite a fan of new attempts at relaying the same message but in different ways, it's something Guillermo del Toro does in his work, often looking at "the other," through different lenses. To me, the Hollow Knight games are very much about systems of power, and how power is distributed or withheld, so I hope if we do get something different from Team Cherry, it's at least as interesting as that.
