            <p>Shams Jorjani, boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead, has taken to Discord to address the rise in reports of performance issues following the arrival of the shooter's Into the Unjust update. In addition to admitting that the new addition has missed the mark from a stability pespective, the exec added that the game's Xbox release now being in the rear view mirror should free up more resources to tackle performance problems.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">Terminid spelunking expedition-themed update</a> arrived yesterday, players have cited an uptick in crashes that Arrowhead are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">already looking into</a>, with the installation size the game's ballooned to on PC and your usual sorts of pesky bugs also being sources of ire, at least among vocal online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In light of that, Arrowhead CEO Jorjani made one of his fairly regular trips to Helldivers 2's Discord server last night, to address some of the concerns folks there were raising. "Performance is something we’ve talked about a TON today. It’s not good enough," he admitted <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412463875068133376">fairly early on</a>. "A fix for some of the most immediate things is being prepped."</p>
<p>"Nobody is saying 'this is fine' at Arrowhead or PlayStation," he added an a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555284089671740">separate post</a>. "We are talking about what to do differently - cus we really want to release content AND keep performance in line. With [the] Xbox release behind us more resources will be available." Jorjani made the last point a number of times, when discussing fixes for performance issues that've drawn ire from players on and off for a while, but have come to a head with this update.</p><p>The update isn't the root cause of the issues. Instead, the CEO links them to a build-up of engine-related limitations he calls "technical debt". "The technical debt is crippling," he wrote in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412560709145071669">another</a> of these many posts. "With the Xbox release behind us we'll be able to take a much better stab at it. Like a double stab with a bigger knife."</p>
<p>Jorjani reckons a single massive performance-focused update - something <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412550041654001725">he said</a> Arrowhead would "prefer not to have to do", but will if it's "needed" - wouldn't be enough to tackle all of this tech debt. He also suggested that pulling all the game's developers off of creating new additions, like warbonds, and putting them onto fixes isn't the simple solution it might seem, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412557539530510399">writing</a>: "if we could put every single soul on just performance/stability and significantly improve those we would - but not everyone can make an impact on performance and the issues that need to be fixed are complex and take time to work at."</p>
<p>I didn't run into any major issues while dipping my toe into the update last night, but here's hoping Arrowhead can offer some performance relief soon. For now, their CEO doesn't reckon this uptick in player dissatisfaction has put the shooter back in as dire straits as it found itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">following the Escalation of Freedom update last year</a>. The studio ended up unveiling a 60-day plan of tweaks, in an effort to turn around player sentiment back then.</p>
<p>While acknowledging there are "definitely some similarities" between the two situations, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555636767723541">Jorjani argued</a> that this time it at least isn't a double whammy of player frustrations about how the game plays mechanic-wise and how it runs. "Since then, I think it's safe to say we've fixed one thing and kept wobbling on the other," he wrote. "I hope we proved back then that we won't give up till we get it right."</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> is the debut fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from new Polish developer Rebel Wolves, a studio founded by former members of Witcher outfit CD Projekt. In June, obvious vampire thrall Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady">expressed happy emotions</a> about main character Coen's balance of mortal and undead abilities - by day, he'll trot around having regular human chinwags with people and participating in regular human swordfights, by night he transmogrifies into a nimble Nosferatu, able to teleport and slash people with his talons. Now, it's time to dig further into the game's two critical resources, which are handily encapsulated by the title: time and blood.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The game revolves around a 30-day, 30-night quest to rescue your family from some bastard vampire lord's castle. Time doesn't tick down continuously, however, as in the likes of The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Instead, each day-night cycle is broken into eight periods, represented by a bar. Within each period, you're free to explore and carry out less significant tasks without advancing the clock. The world is frozen, however lively it may appear: burning houses will flake and fizzle away indefinitely without collapsing into ash. Actions marked with an hourglass option, however, bring that period to an end and shuffle you onto the next.

"We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input," creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg">IGN</a> in a recent interview. "So that's where the time as a resource idea came in." 
</p><p>
The other thing to know is that the sequence of tasks, events and objectives is strongly player-led. You can rock up to the aforesaid castle and pick a fight with Vlad The Endgamer after completing the prologue, if you choose, though you'll be poorly equipped to prevail. The majority of other goals appear to be optional. You can even skip the daytime periods entirely if you dislike mingling with the human cattle. The game doesn't end following the resolution of the business with your loved ones, and it's possible this won't prove to be the most important part of the tale.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of human cattle, Dawnwalker also lets you get your fangs into NPCs, including significant story characters. The more necks you suck, and the more general mayhem you cause, the more Notorious you'll be. The world reacts to high notoriety in ways familiar from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> games: expect more guards, but also, more opportunities to terrify the smallfolk into doing your bidding.
</p>
<p>
One of the more interesting twists is that you can deprive Coen of blood to nourish his human side, but this may eventually cause him to escape your control. "If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs," Tomaszkiewicz told IGN. It reminds me of Don't Nod's Vampyr and also, the Dark Urge from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like the sound of this skippable, rearrangable and segmented campaign structure. I also quite like the day/night playstyle distinction, though I'd like to know more about Coen's vampire abilities. Not that Blood Of The Dawnwalker is exclusively about vampires. Rebel Wolves are already teasing future games in the world, with Tomaszkiewicz telling <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dawnwalker/gamescom-2025-interview">PCGamesN</a> that "in this origin story, we needed the vampires because Coen has this vampire nature, but when we're thinking about the saga, we'll include parts that are not about vampires at all, and are instead about other species."
</p>
<p>
It's out in 2026. Seems like a promising throat-guzzler, if you ask me, but then again I am partial to such things (see bio).
