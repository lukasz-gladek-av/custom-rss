        <p>Team Cherry's sliced through any confusion</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The collective desperation for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has evolved. Rather than people getting all up a height about the prospect of getting any news about it, they've now been left up a height due to confusion around some news they have gotten about the game. Cue Team Cherry having to step in to offer a bit of clarification about Silksong's Xbox Showcase cameo yesterday.</p>
<p>In case you were washing your hair, Silksong popped up during the bit that saw Microsoft introduce its handheld, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">the ROG Xbox Ally</a>. There was the usual hardware spinning around and looking cool, plus Xbox's Sarah Bond saying when Silksong popped up on the handheld's screen that the game'll be "available at launch and in Game Pass when the Ally releases later this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter confusion from some fans as to whether Silksong's release was tied to the handheld's release in "holiday 2025". Don't worry, it isn't.</p>
<p>Team Cherry marketing and publishing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin has made as much very clear via the long-suffering fan hive that is the Silksong Discord server. "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," he wrote of the game's release date, "we are not tied to a console release." He then added that Christmas was what he meant by holiday, just to make totally sure there was no room for misinterpretation.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the confusion that had followed the Xbox showcase appearance, these posts came in response to a Discord user with the wonderful handle fleetwood_bigmac asking Griffin for confirmation that Silksong was still on track to release before 2026. The dev replied "wait...what?" to that, likely realising that even if it was trolling, making things clear to the hardcore skongers beyond all doubt was probably a good shout.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming before Christmas 2025, possibly before September given a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">certain confirmed cameo</a> down under, and its release isn't tied to Xbox's new game playing box.</p>
<p>To be fair, we learned the date that Silksong will be playable as part of an Australian museum exhibit before we got a full release date for it, so you can't really blame fans for not knowing whether they're coming or going at this point. They've spent part of the last few years doing stuff like trying to read into comments on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">cake recipes</a> and their brains are just begging for straight, indisputable answers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the long-in-development endless cat breeding game from devs Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, has just had its release pencilled in for February 10th, 2026, by a fresh trailer. Yes, it’s still looking very weird and nigh impossible to explain to a mate in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have"> trailer it got in April</a>, this latest one roped in the most fitting collab <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">Binding of Isaac</a> developer McMillen and co could have landed, in the form of sinewy surrealism expert and YouTuber MeatCanyon. We’ve also gotten a nice overview of where the devs are at in assembling their weird feline with two heads.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, the release date trailer featured a cartoon bloke explaining a bit about his cat to a real bloke who I’m sure is a real vet. Among other things, the kitty’s got a gambling addiction, a conjoined twin, and has been probed by aliens in addition to having made a deal with the devil. So, just your average cat with average cat quirks.</p>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/686060/view/529848673510623712?l=english">Steam dev blog</a>, McMillen explained the decision to push back releasing the “turn based legacy roguelike draft sim” into the wild until next year, rather than chucking it out of the cat flap before the end of 2025.</p>
<p>“Dude, listen. Launching in Nov–Dec is hard,” he wrote, “We want this game to get the attention it deserves and don’t want to compete with holidays and holiday AAA releases. And honestly, adding a few more months to dev means launching with an even more heavily tested and polished experience!”</p>
<p>In addition to more general polishing and playtesting, the sorts of things the team says they’ll be focusing on in this extra time include the addition of custom events, more cutscenes, and making sure they can launch the game in a few different languages.</p>
<p>McMillen added that Mewgenics’ mysterious final boss - which I’ve got no doubt will be <strong>something</strong> - is on track to be finished by the end of this month. The game’s “big secret late-game system” is already ready to go, and it’ll start getting some “alt/shiny furniture” next week. Sit back down on your gleaming throne, I know you’re excited about that last part, but patience is key here.</p>
<p>Why does a turn-based RPG/roguelike thing about cats shagging needs sparkling sofas, you might wonder. Don't look at me, I've got no idea whatsoever, but Mewgenics has definitely captured my curiosity, even if it's just because it has cats in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
