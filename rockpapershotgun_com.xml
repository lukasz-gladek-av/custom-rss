            <p>Delightful medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a> is among a number of games which have been temporarily delisted on Steam, as a result of a security vulnerability being unearthed in the Unity engine. Other games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>, have already received updates as a result of the issue.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A security vulnerability was identified that affects games and applications built on Unity versions 2017.1 and later for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems," Unity <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031">revealed late on Friday</a>. "There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers. We have proactively provided fixes that address the vulnerability, and they are already available to all developers. The vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher RyotaK, and we thank him for working with us."</p>
<p>Unity added that all versions of games made with Unity since an update in September 2017 "may contain this vulnerability". A <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01">security advisory page</a> about the issue says such apps risk being "susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system, which could enable local code execution or information disclosure at the privilege level of the vulnerable application." The advisory also claims that the Unity engine itself has been provided with the fixes that developers will need.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A security vulnerability affecting our games that use Unity has recently been identified.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As a precaution and to keep you safe, we have temporarily removed the following titles and products from digital storefronts while we implement the necessary updates to address the issue:…</p></div>— Obsidian (@Obsidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As a result, publishers including <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV256762">Microsoft</a> and Obsidian have opted to temporarily pull affected games from sale on Steam while they're updated. Pentiment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, Wasteland 3, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> are among the yanked games, and as of writing have yet to be restored to the storefront. Meanwhile, some games have ended up as more complex cases. For instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s premium edition has been pulled, but the base game remains up, because the only element of it at risk is a Unity-developed artbook.</p><p>A number of games have also remained online after receiving rapid updates, with Among Us devs Innersloth having been fittingly quick to <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1974232390479298663">deal with potential susness</a>, while Marvel Snap <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1974171006085554309">was rapidly patched</a>. It's worth noting that Microsoft recommend you temporarily uninstall any affected games until updates are available. The company extend that to games they no longer support, like The Elder Scrolls: Legends and 2019 versions of both Doom and Doom 2. These unsupported games have also been pulled from stores, so the need to uninstall only applies if you already own them.</p>
<p>Odds are the pulled games which haven't been sunsetted will return to Steam relatively soon with fresh updates, but it's maybe worth checking your list of current installs to make sure nothing affected's hanging around on your drives.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta cheaters were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/water-is-wet-the-sky-is-blue-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-has-cheaters">inevitable and expected</a>, with Activision hinting that they were intentionally prepping their big anti-cheat guns prior to early access kicking off. Now the beta's first weekend's passed, the publishers' anti-cheat enforcers Team Ricochet have posted an update addressing the cheating situation, claiming that their efforts thus far have seen a lot of success.</p>
<p>Seriously, they go as far as openly declaring that cheat sellers are "feeling the heat", which is a massive missed opportunity to use the phrase '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">quaking in their unsecured boots</a>', but we can't have everything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta," Activision's post read. "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We’re watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt."</p>
<p>Cue the whipping out of some stats which the developers say apply to the beta's opening two days. "97% of cheaters were stopped within 30 minutes of their first sign-in," and "fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes." "And this is just the beginning," Activision wrote. "When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat’s defenses will only grow stronger."</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>They're impressive stats to tout, but they do leave some question marks. Without the full numbers in terms of cheating instances detected and dealt with, it's tough to say how much success this symbolises. There's also the matter of any numbers only taking account instances of cheating Team Ricochet managed to detect, leaving the potential for attempts that may have gone totally undetected to have slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>Activision also went beyond just saying their beta anti-cheat efforts have been successful thus far. "Major cheat providers are now labeling their tools 'unusable' or 'detected'," they wrote further on in the post. "Resellers are acknowledging they have no reliable products to offer for Black Ops 7. We’re not only disabling their cheats, but also their illegal businesses as well. We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> launched. Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement."</p>
<p>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge and we’re committed to leading the charge," they concluded. "We continue to bring new systems online during Beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights." It's fighting talk and we'll have to see whether Black Ops 7's full release brings more hoops for regular players to jump through as has happened with mandatory secure boot.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's beta runs until October 8th, so odds are Activision will be back to share more stats about their anti-cheat efforts across the full duration of early access then.</p>
