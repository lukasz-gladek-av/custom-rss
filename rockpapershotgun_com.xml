When you have a game that is so run focused like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, balance is the key to not getting someone to throw their controller at a wall, cursing their own birth as they do so. Up until now, there were parts of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> that certainly weren't balanced, though that mostly came down to a few bugs. As of today though, there's a new update you can download for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> which brings in some much needed fixes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, there's a big fix for Libra, Creature of Night. Previously, Libra could get stuck in a loop of doing the same attack over and over again (one worst case scenario seeing this occur a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4lm4r/72_consecutive_attacks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-update-aims-to-fix-one-nightlord-boss-tanking-your-framerate-the-other-from-going-berserk-and-mashing-you-into-paste-with-72-consecutive-attacks/">whopping 72 times</a>), but that's now been fixed. You'll also find that the game won't look as much like a slideshow when facing off against Adel, Baron of the Night anymore, as a bug that meant the game's stability wasn't so stable has now been fixed.
</p>
<p>
One fix I find personally funny is that there would occasionally be an issue where during the "Find the Demon Merchant in Limveld" personal objective, said Demon Merchant just shouldn't show up. That too has now been fixed, but I do love the idea of just being stood up by a Demon Merchant as you set about on your quest. Sad moody fanfic when?
</p>
<p>
Bow users will technically be in for a bit of a tougher time, as a bug that caused physical attack power to increase on bows when a passive magic, lightning, or holy effect was added to the weapon has now been fixed. There's a few other small fixes too, you can read about those on the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1012">official patch notes</a>. A small update overall to be sure, but one that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">paving the way for duos somewhere down the line</a>.
