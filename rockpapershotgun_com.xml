            <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-writers-new-dark-fantasy-vania-also-features-vampires-plus-screaming-spiders">first wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> in January, I worried I might have spotlighted a dud. Or at least, something fairly routine. Mandragora sure does look like a lot of dark fantasy side-scrollers - gritty yet plump and colourful, like they stuck a bike pump in Castlevania, or took a chisel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trine">Trine</a>. It sure does have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> classes and skilltrees. It sure does have crafting, with hundreds of items to acquire. </p>
<p>I confess, I covered it in large part because they have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> writer Brian Mitsoda on the ticket. But then I read the comments on that piece, weeks later, and there were a few lost souls raving about playing the demo for hours. Mandragora launches today. I've now spent an hour or two with a full build myself, and yeah, this feels like the good stuff.</p><!--more-->

<p>The key opening draw is that for all the emphasis in certain trailers on systems and craftables, Mandragora seems very story-led. It takes place in an apocalyptic world where a sepulchral King Priest holds sway over the Crimson City, promising to keep the nightspawn at bay. The King Priest looks a bit like Judge Claude Frollo from Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame, and shares Frollo's enthusiasm for torturing witches.</p>
<p>You play a Crimson City inquisitor who intervenes to mercy-kill one of said tortured witches, saturating yourself with a mysterious power in the process. Seeking to save face, the King Priest anoints you as one of god's chosen, and sends you forth to track down another witch. Meanwhile, a voice starts whispering in your head. </p>
<p>The opening tutorial sections are filled with sturdily voiced NPC chit-chats that thicken the setting like delicious fistfuls of cornstarch. The character portraits twitch and glare like possessed oil paintings - some of the commenters on my last piece found them off-putting, but for me, they're the best thing about Mandragora's visual direction so far. Hurrying through the Crimson City, you bandy words with some fellow inquisitors and pick up the rudiments of dodge-rolling. Then it's off to the woods to rescue a blacksmith and bother some massive wolves.</p>
<p>As an action-RPG, Mandragora appears to have plenty going on, striking a balance between the lean feel of classic Castlevania and the unlocks fusillade of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.  You've got a primary weapon and an auxiliary such as a spell or shield, a jump, a ledge-grab and a spread of gear slots. The combat goes heavy on stamina management and evasion, with the promise of stirring abilities and passives together into bespoke methods of monster-murderment.</p>
<p>The animations and controls are a bit halting, but it all seems engrossing enough. Still, I'm more interested in the gently labyrinthine levels, which are woven around Dark Soulsy altars where you can fast travel and level up, and are nicely abundant in secretive high platforms and concealed entrances.</p>
<p>Again, though, what grabs me upfront is the centrality of the story and writing. Even at its gamiest, Mandragora appears to be going for a certain consistency. There's a tutorial beat early on where you smash some crates and the merchant who owns those crates cusses you out, only to realise that you're an Inquisitor and beg for forgiveness. I like a game that knows how to turn an everyday Crash Bandicootism into characterisation. I'll hopefully have more thoughts down the road (Mandragora is an estimated 40+ hours in length). In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">here's the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Harken to the tolling of the village bell! See the blazing of the watchfires on the parapet! CD Projekt have issued a warning about Witcher 4 beta scams. Apparently, people have been receiving invites to playtest the new Witcher, even though CD Projekt have previously said that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't release before 2027</a>. If you sign up to anything right now, the only thing you'll be beta-testing is how fast you can change all your usernames and passwords.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - this is a scam!" shrieks a <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">social media post</a>, like a cleric at the chapel door ushering the peasants inside. "We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."</p>
<p>"Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams," the post adds, just in case that immersion-breaking mention of email clients had sabotaged your day with the knowledge that you are not, in fact, a greying leathery Lothario with a silver sword. "They see right through them and slay them!"</p>
<p>Not to rap you on the nose with a rolled-up lore bible, CD Projekt, but I think that characterisation does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-explain-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer-geralt-could-have-said-this-about-ciri-as-well">The Witcher's emotive branching storytelling</a> a disservice. If this were a quest from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Geralt would probably trace the scammers to their lair and discover that they are actually small orphan children who were cruelly disfigured and cast out by the villagers on account of having hairy toes, or something. He would have to decide between butchering them or butchering the villagers or blowing up Megaton. Then he would partake in some sex with a witch (I 'ardly knew 'er, etc) and play a rousing round of Triple Triad. I confess, my memories of The Witcher 3 are a little rusty.</p>
<p>"Should we ever organize any beta tests in the future, you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites," CD Projekt conclude. While you wait, you can re-read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) frenzied demands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-needs-a-double-jumping-horse-like-elden-ring-or-im-out">for a double-jumping horse</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
