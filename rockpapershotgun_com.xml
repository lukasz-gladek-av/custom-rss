            <p>The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> are making a "spiritual successor" to the 2016 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". </p>
<p>Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.</p>

<p>"What can I say? I still love Duskers," says Tim Keenan, co-founder of Misfits Attic, in the video that shows off what the studio has been up to, including two other game prototypes. </p>

<p>The footage for Humanity 2.0 shows the player cutting up and rearranging the rooms of a spaceship using the green retro interface familiar to players of the first game. The player types "slice" as a command to chop up parts of the vessel, for example. But that's really all we see that seems significantly different so far. The rest of the video talks of pirates and scrap-hunting in deep space. But it seems too early in development to show any of that yet.</p><p>Keenan wants the game to go beyond mere survival though, to include themes of "sacrificing to save the survivors of this bleak future, and rebooting humanity". But he also reassures viewers that the tone will still be pretty grim. "It's just a ray of hope, not a sunrise," he says. "The game will still be dark."</p>
<p>Like I say, this is not the only thing the studio is working on. Misfits Attic have three projects in the pipeline. The others include a fantasy-themed strategy game currently titled "Scheme", which sees you "starting as a lowborn and rising to power while outwitting and backstabbing some very powerful highborns". It's described as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> lite", in which you never have any armies yourself, but need to use Game Of Thrones style manipulation to convince other factions to war with one another. </p>
<p>The third game is a tactical chessy roguelike temporarily known as "Magic Wizard Chess" but in which something weird is going on behind the wibbling CRT scanlines. "While you're playing you may be psychologically evaluated for an unknown reason," says Keenan, "but don't worry about that."</p>
<p>Duskers remains one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-hacking-games">best hacking games</a> you can play today. It gives you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-review">the feeling of being a lost and lonely engineer</a> hired by a big ugly company from the Alien movies, except all you have are unreliable drone pals and shaky typing hands hovering over your command-line interface. It would be cool to see a follow-up some day, but with three games in the assembly line, it might be a while until those bay doors open. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sci-fi battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> is due a "meaningful update" , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he's called "Apex 2.0". To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>CEO Andrew Wilson made the comments in <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf">an earnings call</a> for EA's quarterly financial results, the sad phone call where numbers go to be interrogated. </p>
<p>"[On] a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience. An Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," he said. </p>
<p>The Apex update "will probably happen after a Battlefield launch," he added. A reference to the the as-yet untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, which the publisher has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">teasing recently</a>. Elsewhere in the call Wilson said that wartorn shooter is expected to launch before April 2026.  </p><p>Previously, Wilson dismissed the idea of a "2.0" version of the game, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-ceo-pushes-back-against-the-idea-of-an-apex-20-to-solve-its-issues-after-the-titles-disappointing-quarter">Gamesindustry.biz</a>. But it looks like he feels differently now? Ah, the winds of business are ever swooshing. Despite Apex Legends still being one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royales</a>, EA aren't content with how the first-person shooter has been doing in recent times, it seems. </p>
<p>"We've had over 200 million people play the game," said Wilson. "However, the trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been headed in the direction that we have wanted for some time.</p>
<p>"[We] continue to try and test and develop more great content for that community. And I would say we have seen some progress in that, but probably not as much as we would have liked."</p>
<p>Of course, none of that means Apex Legends is going anywhere. The company still sees the series as a valuable bit of corpo-loot. Wilson himself says that "franchises that exist at this level and have this much fan love don't come along all that often."</p><p>Since appearing in 2019, Apex has gone through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-years-of-apex-legends-how-surreal-success-became-a-fight-to-stay-fresh">many years</a> of updates, changes, and additions. It recently added a throwback mode which simply reminded our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">how much better it got over time</a>. When I learned that Respawn were developing a battle royale all those years ago, my first thought was: "God, not another one". But it turned out to be my favourite in the entire genre. Whatever happens to Apex next, it's probably worth watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
