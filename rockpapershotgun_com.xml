            <p>Let the runes of protection blaze upon the vestments of the machine spirit; let psalm pervade circuitry and obliterate the Enemy’s designs; let fire and catechism fall upon the creeping ruin of Abominable Intelligence. Brothers! The hour of motion is at hand. Games Workshop have banned their employees from using generative AI tools to create or design Warhammer stuff, because their senior management don’t consider the technology very “exciting”. Their CEO also seems irked about software companies shoving generative AI into every new device or system update, whether it’s desired or not. The tech-priests are coming for your candy ass, ChatGPT!</p>
<p>That said, they don’t appear to be prohibiting the usage of generative AI by partners, including game developers, and they will allow senior staff “to continue to be inquisitive about the technology”, which I am tempted to read as a sop to investors driven stir-crazy by NVIDIA’s share price. Omnissiah be… somewhat enthused? Relatively undisappointed?</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Games Workshop’s stance reflects concerns about the company’s art being appropriated and used for generative AI ‘training’. I’m sure they’re also worried about a backlash from Warhammer’s massive community of miniature painters and other external creatives (recently, poster marketplace Displate <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">got it in the neck</a> over AI "red flags" in a Warhammer 40,000 artwork). Speaking during the company’s <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/7lRczzQBbvA22PEmSVJN8K/2de2f722e20e1d69b9aa3ed4e1b95678/2025-26_half_year_report_v3.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a> yesterday, Games Workshop chief executive Kevin Rountree shared the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>A very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it. We do have a few senior managers that are: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not. </p>
<p>We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio - hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, all this seemingly just applies to Games Workshop itself, for the moment, but it’s sure to have ripple effects among Warhammer videogame developers such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a> studio Owlcat, who revealed back in 2024 that they were <a href="https://x.com/OwlcatGames/status/1763946679470788722?s=20">using generative AI</a> "for additional work with concepts and speeding up some internal processes". Games Workshop are historically pretty zealous about how their designs and setting are recreated by third parties.</p><p>While there are plenty of generative AI evangelists on the shop, including a few big cheeses at EA, Ubisoft and most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-director-goes-all-in-on-ai-as-south-koreas-games-industry-looks-to-compete-on-the-global-stage">Stellar Blade developers Shift-Up</a>, there is also a mounting tide of resistance to generative AI adoption. Recently, Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">cancelled a whole game</a> over suspicions of generative AI usage in a trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse have banned generative AI art from their games, and Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">partly walked back</a> their own implementations of the tech in the forthcoming Divinity.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you've laid hands on the plastic contours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, you’ve probably seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a> in action: badges of honour (or of 'Unsupported' disgrace) on a game’s Steam store page, reflecting how well it runs and plays on the portable PC per Valve’s in-house testing. The programme is being expanded to include the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> too, and is set to bestow a lot more games with Steam Machine Verified status, given what a Valve designer calls "fewer restraints" in their judging criteria.</p>
<p>Lawrence Yang – who’s worked on the new Machine, the Deck, and the also-incoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> – told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game Developer</a> that it’ll be easier for a game to achieve a coveted green checkmark sticker with its SteamOS mini-PC, and that Valve will "be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback" for its new verification checks as the Steam Deck’s. Even if, especially in the case of the Frame VR headset, different requisites will apply. This <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-own-any-steam-deck-verified-games-then-youve-already-got-a-guarantee-theyll-work-on-the-steam-machine">follows a Valve blog post</a> that put things in simpler terms: if a game is Steam Deck Verified, it'll be Steam Machine Verified too.</p>
<p>Rather than a lowering of standards, for the Steam Machine specifically, it’s pretty obvious that “lifting constraints” simply reflects differences in the hardware’s power and use cases versus the handheld Steam Deck. Yang didn’t specify details, but it’s easy to guess which criteria from the Deck Verified programme weren't as urgently applicable: for instance, some only score a 'Playable' badge instead of full Verified status because they include small text that’s harder to read on the 7in, 800p screen. The Steam Machine intends to hook up to TVs and desktop monitors, so that’s probably not worth including in the new device’s rulebook.</p>

<p>Considering the shared use of SteamOS, other touchstones will definitely remain, like whether a game can display the correct gamepad button glyphs (Valve would very much like you to play the Steam Machine with their revamped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>) or whether it needs occasional keyboard input. Valve will be testing for performance too, though since the Steam Machine is significantly beefier in the graphical muscles than the Deck, it’d naturally win more Playable and Verified statuses here anyway.</p><p>This is all good news for players and developers alike – the former get more at-a-glance transparency on which games in their library will work, and the latter (as Game Developer points out) a handy marketing tool. It’s a shame, then, that the Steam Deck itself has become mired in uncertainty since its reveal late last year, the ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">component shortages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">price rises</a> raising questions around the Gabecube’s affordability and lack of a concrete release date beyond "early 2026".</p>

            <p>A first round of hotfixes has arrived for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, following the Minecrafty sandboxer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-out-now-and-its-devs-are-advising-those-suffering-download-issues-or-errors-to-keep-plugging-away">arrival in early access</a> form yesterday. Developers Hypixel have also offered some insight into which aspects of it they're planning to prioritise working on in the coming months.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving right into <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">the note</a>s for this initial round of hotfixing, you'll naturally find a number of the "most critical" initial teething issues folks reported running into upon firing the game up for the first time. For example, you'll now get a warning if your computer's time is out of date, since this had caused some "authentication issues", with the launcher login process as a whole hopefully now less likely to serve you such errors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to setting up servers, Hypixel have added a message letting you know whether authentication is required after your server boots up and made sure you'll be automatically switched into offline mode if your online session runs into a hiccup which invalidates it. A number of crash causes have also been ironed out, including some caused by simply using buckets - that fix will require you to destroy and replace any workbenches which now aren't working as intended. Picking certain hair styles before doing your eyebrows in the character creator is another of these potential returners-to-desktop which have been dealt with.</p>
<p>Alongside delivering this round of initial fixes, as part of <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a longer post</a> celebrating Hytale's early access launch, Hypixel have offered a bit of insight into what you can expect them to be doing in the near future:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the first few months, we intend to deliver updates quickly and frequently, as there is still a large backlog of obvious construction sites we need to tackle before we can move into larger, more bespoke updates and patch cadences. The work on the official minigames will begin in the coming months, enabling us to create new systems and features that expand gameplay and provide wider access to 3rd-party servers.</p>
<p>As a side note, we already have prototypes of social features, such as friend lists and proximity voice chat, in development. Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're planning on giving Hytale a go this week, we've got handy guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a> to play with your mates, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-show-coordinates">finding out where you're at</a> in the world, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">setting up for a session</a> on the Steam Deck.</p>
