            <p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a>'s latest celebrity elusive target mission is all about Eminem. The rapper has Agent 47 take down his blonde alter-ego Slim Shady, it's all very meta and a tad less appealing to me than the cameos previously made by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-latest-free-elusive-target-mission-makes-you-bruce-lees-bodyguard-and-is-out-now">Bruce Lee</a> and Mads Mikkelsen as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">Bond villain Le Chiffre</a>.</p>
<p>That said, a new interview some IO Interactive folks have given to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>, in which boss Hakan Abrak makes clear there will be a new Hitman coming once the studio have gotten some stuff off their plate, has caught my attention by contrasting Mr Nem with murderbald handler Diana.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, let's get the next Hitman stuff out of the way. "So of course there will be more Hitman," Abrak said when asked if there'll be more hitmen now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>'s morphed in catch-all basket World of Assassination. "But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>IO, of course, also have Bond game 007 First Light to put out soon, with a new fantasy game unimaginatively codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-fantasy">Project Fantasy</a> also mentioned here as being in the wings. As for what this next Hitman might look like, lead level designer Jacob Mikkelsen simply said he doesn't regret any of the paths the series has gone down to this point, citing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> as the most out-there entry, but still as a game that taught the studio valuable lessons.</p><p>Speaking of valuable lessons, here's the bit in the interview which makes me regret not having immediately been down to give Agent 47's Eminem mission a go the moment I saw it was a thing. The rapper acts as a handler helping guide barcode man to Shady, and I'd not thought about how that'd allow the devs to play him off of the most Eminem-coded character in Hitman canon. "There’s some interchanges between Eminem and [usual 47 bossperson] Diana [Burnwood] that are really fun," according to writer Jen Simpkins. "Because, as you know, Diana is a very different character to Eminem. And it’s a very surreal level where there’s a lot of reality blending and mixing into one."</p>
<p>Personally, I can see the pair really getting along. Diana seems like she'd appreciate the sort of dedication and practice which goes into nailing that one really fast verse in Rap God, while Eminem seems like the kind of guy to understand the sort of care and adroitness it takes to navigate shadowy multinational murder conspiracies while you've got a very narrow margin for error. After all, he is master of all that's shady and slim.</p>
<p>Those two should helm Hitman 4 if 47 opts to hang up his piano wire in the interim. The Eminem mission is available in World of Assassination until December 31st, so if you fancy trying it, you've got plenty of time.</p>

            <p>Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s just gotten a patch with some noteworthy balancing tweaks and fixes ahead of its latest warbond - <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos</a> - dropping. In short, a fair few guns now do more damage, some enemies have been made a tad less potent, and the drawback which usually comes with attachinga magnifying scope to your favourite bug blaster has been scaled back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the notes for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274?l=english">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0 patch</a>, the studio have clearly spied that the weapon ergonomics penalty suffered if you equip a long-range sight to your gun was putting folks off from using such attachments. So, in order to make them "more a matter of preference", you'll now notice the muzzles of guns with tube red dot sights, combat scopes, and sniper scopes being a fair whack less lethargic in following where you point your crosshair. The sniper scope change also applies to the anti-materiel rifle.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Arrowhead have begun to implement some tweaks designed to make pistols more ideal at close range over long, while still effective enough to use. Moving to primary guns, the defender, reprimand, M7S SMG, variable, and M90A have all had their damage upped by three to 10 points, with a couple also getting durable damage boosts. The peacemaker, verdict, and M6C/SOCOM pistols have also undergone similar tweaks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, war strider and bile spewer enemies have been tweaked to stagger less when hit with explosions. The stalker, on the other hand, has had its tongue attack nerfed slightly so you won't stagger as much when slapped by the thing protruding from the bug's meaty maw. Finally, some new unbound keybind options have been added to make quick-swapping gear easier and playing in first-person should mesh better with your field-of-view settings.</p><p>There you go. I'm going to duck talking about the bug fixes to instead mention that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation in the works at Sony is now set to be directed by Justin Lin of Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fame, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. I mention this because it's got me wondering what the drifting equivalent of being sent flying by a rogue bug tongue is. I assume the answer's maybe catching a kerb, rolling, and landing with your passenger's mouth locked over your nose. That's never happened to me, I assure you.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell your family about this patch and the movie. They need to know Vin Diesel'll now have less scope trouble when he's inevitably confirmed to be playing <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1779875631334899883">General Brasch</a>.</p>
