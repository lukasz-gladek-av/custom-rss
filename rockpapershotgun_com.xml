            <p>Beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> traumatic-childhood-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding Of Issac: Rebirth</a> turned 10 yesterday, and it’s half off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">Steam </a>to celebrate. What’s more, maker Edmund McMillen has announced that the foretold online co-op update is due on the 18th of this month, alongside a “considerable” balance update. Consider me considering the considerability of said considerable update!</p>

<p>“Isaac online will feature a full online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mode (with completion markers) alongside a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad,” <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">Ximbled McMillen</a>. The game has had local mate mode for a while now, but BinHeads have been anticipating this online update since McMillen said it was coming “soon” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-binding-of-isaac-is-getting-online-multiplayer-soon">last year</a>.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou will be able to play with random matches or friends” - four of them - confirmed executive producer Tyrone Rodriguez <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">at the time</a>. Also confirmed were tracked winstreaks, the ability to load up specific seeds, and one item per player for boss rooms and treasure chests.</p><p>McMillen’s Xeet also features a load of concept art, boss designs, and storyboards, so worth having a looksie if you’re a real BumHead. “TBOI takes over people's lives, despite being a short and entirely beatable game, because every new combination of random enemies and random items manages to feel like a brand new adventure, infinitely more important than any you've had so far,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review">wrote</a> Alec Meer (RPS in peace) back in 2014.</p>
<p>McMillen is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> - a game I’ve been waiting for since it was announced over a decade ago. The last we saw of the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> feline fuse ‘em up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shaky-cam-footage-emerges-of-edmund-mcmillens-turn-based-cat-tics-mewgenics">this here shaky cam footage</a> last year. The creator has previously described the game as "like a bunch of things, but not like anything else. It really feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets Pokémon meets some sort of D&amp;D-type adventure game, with an Animal Crossing hub". Stop. You had me at cats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
