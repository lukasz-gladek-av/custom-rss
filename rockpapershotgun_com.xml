            <p>If you wondered why it worth making such a fuss to save Super Earth from the Illuminate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> not too long ago, you might want to take a look at the game's latest Galactic War twist. A fresh major order has players embarking to cities that the squids have twisted in their image, and they're a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Urban warfare's the thing in the shooter at the moment, with the divers having just resisted a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">big bug invasion</a> of a bunch of cities. Now, they're dropping in to try and save innocent citizens that might already have been, uh, squidified.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a>, it's been discovered that the Illuminate who survived the invasion's defeat have managed to take over two planets and transform their cities into places that look fit for a Xenomorph hen do. Alairt III and Alamak VII are the worlds in question.</p><p>As outlined in the order's briefing, 

</p><p>"Comparative topography confirms preliminary intel: our metropolises appear to have undergone unsanctioned re-engineering," the briefing says, "The fate of the millions trapped within these altered cityscapes is unknown. Their conversion into hostile biological assets is probable; they are considered compromised until proven otherwise."</p>
<p>Those trapped citizens seem to have been encased in the banks of pod-looking structures players who've already dropped in have found littering the place, often propped up in rows against the sides of ruined skyscrapers. Some folks also reckon they've run into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldmds9/is_that_what_i_think_it_is/#lightbox">structures that resemble</a> the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:Objectives?file=Beacon.jpg">Illuminate beacons</a> from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p> 
<p>A nice easter egg if so, but also maybe a bit of foreshadowing that the squids have attempted to call in some  reinforcements following their failure to destroy or capture the Helldivers' home planet. One thing's for sure, while no new enemies have come with the first deployment of Illuminatified cities, it does seem like Arrowhead have gotten well and truly back into the swing of regularly finding interesting ways to switch things up on players.</p>
<p>There are a few complaints about things feeling a tad repetitive in the Reddit threads I've scanned, but they're few and far between. Environments that offer visually interesting twists have long been an ace up HD2's sleeve in terms of keeping things fresh between the big updates - hello, memed-to-death <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-robot-vietnam-melevelon-creek">Malevelon Creek</a> - so it's cool to see the devs leaning into that again.</p>
<p>It's also fitting to be fighting the Illuminate again after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">this morning's patch</a> added in a free cape that commemorates the last big victory over them. Just maybe don't put down your gun and use emotes to point that out while you're in Leviathan firing range.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>New York, New York, it’s a helluva town! The Bronx is up but the Battery's also up because they both run on anti-gravity now! Haha, oh my sides. Please excuse my very whimsical Broadway introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aether-and-iron">Aether &amp; Iron</a>, a sci-fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from an alternate 1930s in which New York has taken a turn for the Bioshock Infinite, soaring through the clouds care of fancy “aether” technology.</p>
<p>It’s inspired by art deco and 1930s detective comics, features a turn-based combat system involving getaway cars, and is the work of a team that includes former Ubisoft scribe Justin Cummings. Here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In Aether &amp; Iron you play an offensively stylish smuggler who sports the kind of trenchcoat and fedora combination I dream of pulling off, but which typically makes me look as though I’ve gotten dressed at a themepark giftshop while escaping a flood. Using what appears to be a blend of ornate map screens, visual novel backdrops and workshop menus, you’ll recruit a crew and carry contraband while building up three core stats – Hustle, Smarts, and Brass.</p>
<p>“No matter how good you are always a dice roll away from success or failure,” the blurb cautions. I imagine they lose a lot of dice up there in giddy, free-floating New York. The city’s tabletop role-players must be an absolute plague on the people living beneath - imagine being killed by a D20 dropped from 10 miles up. But I digress.</p>
<p>In the course of making a tidy haul on the seedy side of the tracks, you will also have the opportunity to “rise as a savior, withdraw as a renegade, or evolve into a symbol of resilience in a world of authoritarian barons and high-stakes strategy”. Whichever route you pick, it sounds like there will be plenty of car chases. The game’s aether-powered roadsters can be outfitted with smoke dispensers, flame throwers, steel plates and grenade launchers. Going by the trailer above, the vehicular battles are grid-based with the quirk that the splitting of the road might divide one driver from the rest.</p>
<p>Aether &amp; Iron appeals to me partly because they’ve successfully rolled one of those D20s and conquered the urge to label it “aetherpunk”. Well done, developers Seismic Squirrel! That was a close one. I also quite enjoy the snippets I’ve caught of the writing from the trailer.
