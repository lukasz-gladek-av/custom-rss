            <p>The Steam page of recently released post-apocalyptic survival shooter Misery - seemingly unaffiliated with the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery">Stalker mod called Misery</a> - has been pulled offline, with developers Platypus Entertainment alleging it's the result of a DMCA takedown filed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-shadow-of-chernobyl">Stalker</a> creators GSC Game World. Platypus say they're in the process of fighting this claim, which an email shared by Platypus themselves suggests is all about copyright and purported use of GSC's "game content" without permission.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of writing, I can verify that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/">Misery's Steam page</a> has gone missing, but it appears that all of the public info currently available about this apparent claim comes entirely from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">Steam post</a> in which Platypus share that email. "GSC Game World attacked Misery with a DMCA strike, and the store page is now suspended, so you cannot buy the game at the moment," the post reads. "In their claim, they state that MISERY infringes on their IP and that players' reviews mention S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which means it hurts their interests. This is absolutely untrue, and we will fight back to reinstate MISERY on Steam."</p>
<p>I've reached out to GSC Game World for comment.</p>
<p>According to the alleged email from Valve in the post, the storefront operators took down the game's page automatically when the takedown was lodged, in order to avoid potential liability for any copyright infringement themselves under the rules of the US <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>. Platypus will have the opportunity to file a counter-notice attempting to prove the copyright infringement claims are inaccurate, and if they do, the copyright claimant would then have 10 business days to file a full-blown lawsuit. If such legal proceedings weren't initiated in that timeframe, the game would automatically be reinstated on Steam.</p><p>"We’ve filed an appeal and are waiting the 10 business days for it to be reviewed," claims a post to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/855897901096108062/1028671244087861359/1436697103660355687">Discord post</a> by Platypus' primary solo developer Maewing. "We’re continuing to work on updates; there will be two big updates at the end of the month and before the New Year. Right now we’re working on cats and dogs.  Thanks everyone for your support and for spreading the word. And please, don’t insult GSC, just say that they acted unfairly."</p>
<p>In the original Steam post, they claimed that Misery is "a completely different concept" and "uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from [GSC's] games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed." "We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP," Platypus added, calling the alleged takedown "an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation."</p>
<p>Further complicating the matter, as documented by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>, is an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/gsc_taking_down_misery/">initial response</a> to the alleged strike filing which saw Maewing use at least one slur. They've since edited this Discord post and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/855897901096108062/1028671244087861359/1436506305673040052">apologised</a> for "old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements", but it still makes all of their posts urging others not to insult GSC ring very hollow.</p>
<p>There's also potential for the whole situation to have a political dimension to it, with GSC being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">a Ukrainian studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit users</a> having spotted signs of support in Platypus' Discord server for Russia in the ongoing conflict between the two countries. I've not been able to verify the chats they've screenshotted myself, due to the Discord allegedly having been scrubbed in the wake of the takedown request. The screenshots include more slurs, this time of a racial nature, and support for the Russian state-linked <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60947877">Wagner Group</a>, a private military company accused of war crimes. There are also a bunch of instances of the letter Z, which has become a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia">symbol of public support</a> for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Maewing claimed in the Discord post which saw them apologise: "I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds."</p>
<p>As of writing, no other games similar to Stalker look to have been hit with takedowns and to my knowledge GSC haven't filed takedowns against the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chernobylite">Chernobylite</a> and STALCRAFT: X before.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are planning to release some DLC for the action RPG by March 2026. That's according the latest financial report of FromSoft parent company Kadokawa, which has attached a window to the add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s promo material had already hinted would be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Call out to the people who're deep in the night of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Nightreign's last addition</a> so they hear. Tell them to scrabble around for a light switch so they can read the info. Remind them not to accidentally fondle a big boss as they paw along the walls. Actually, I'm sure they'll remember that anyway, since it's s-oh no.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'll have to start without them. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar</a>, flip to page 16 of the <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">report's presentation</a>, which covers the six month period that ended on September 30th.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware is currently developing ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN DLC (planned for release in FY2025), ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," reads the future outlook section. While it'd be cool if The Duskbloods does end up migrating from Switch to PC in time, the Nightreign DLC's the only bit of that which is relevant to us PC folks right now.</p>
<p>Kadokawa's 2024 fiscal year ended on March 31st this year, so we can expect this Nightreign DLC out by March 31st, 2026. That's assuming everything goes to plan, with the company leaving some delay wiggle room here.</p>
<p>As to what'll be in the DLC, extra playable Nightfarers and bosses seem pretty certain. Beyond that, things get a bit more mysterious, especially given the potential for FromSoftware to lean on bosses from previous Souls games. Given the DLC has a bit more riding on it than the likes of that free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">Deep of the Night update</a>, I'd be fairly surprised not to see new locales or modes to further spice up the loop of killing whichever new bosses arrive alongside some new boss-beater.</p><p>Maybe they'll add in a map based around Newcastle city centre, and the new bosses are large black-and-white-shirted revellers who bellow 'toon' whenever you get close. You could stick a poison swamp next to Eldon Square, it'd be brill. That's what my fingers are crossed for as the wait for next March begins.</p>

            <p>November goes on. The cavalcade of belles, brutes and barons that is Videogaming continues its push through the midnight forest. Spiderwebs wrap the axles of the gala coaches in which the optimates of Ubisoft, Microsoft and EA drink from lavender flutes, turning their bloodshot eyes from the QA staff powering their barrows through the ruck. The faces of the common developers are a moth-eaten ribbon of quiet striving and terrible hope. The guards form a torchlit embroidery. Every so often, a torch goes out, and the wych elms generate new fruits. The stones in the road cant against our strides. The skulls of live service games burst beneath our wheels, and the analysts in the pageant wagons moan that the future lies behind us now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Then, the woods withdraw and we emerge among flowering graves and fallen buttresses - the remnants of a church. The wagons circle and cooking fires spring up in the transepts, as our scouts contemplate the way forward. Five onward roads fan out from a rotten signpost, each named for a day of the week. Some assuredly lead to disaster. The scouts converse in hisses and, failing to agree, turn to you for instructions. Which day do we choose? Which route is safe?
</p>
<h2>Monday 10th November</h2>
<p>The skies above this path appear to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ambrosia-sky">drip ambrosia</a>, the food of the gods, and yet the splashed soil beneath revolts with fungus. The birds creasing the frail sunlight are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809940/Drill_Bird/">drill-tipped</a> and the clouds appear <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/">very changeable</a>. Our wayfinders murmur of a distant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122860/ZATO__I_Love_the_World_and_Everything_In_It/">closed city</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3609980/Yes_My_Queen/">imprisoned queen</a>.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 11th November</h2>
<p>Even as we study this road, our oldest scout - a one-eyed woman in furs with a staff twice her height - is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">possessed</a> by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3906660/Sacred_2_Remaster/">spirits</a> of prog rockers, roused from the neglected graveyard. She regresses to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416100/Goodnight_Universe/">state of infancy</a>, capable only of chanting "all in all, you're just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">block</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467710/Wall_World_2/">wall</a>."</p>
<h2>Wednesday 12th November</h2>
<p>A hard, bare road, and yet the banks are riddled with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">burrows</a> (pictured) that appear surprisingly welcoming, with postage stamp doormats and tinklesome chimneys. The ghosts of Pink Floyd abandon your moon-touched scout. Regaining her senses, she talks cryptically of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/">million layers beneath</a> where swords fly and time stands still.</p>
<h2>Thursday 13th November</h2>
<p>This road is heavily torn and depleted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-aims-to-fill-a-colin-mcrae-shaped-void-and-its-out-in-early-access-next-month">curious wheelmarks</a> that speak of some great contest, beyond the ken of our wagoneers. Their chevronned textures overlap to form the impression - or is it more than fancy? - of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255860/Hymer_2000/">wide eyes and chattering mouths</a>.</p>

<p>Does this monstrous forest have an outside? There are rumours up and down the train that this is the final November, that the woods are expanding faster than we can travel through them, that the Maw's latest eruption will be endless. Still, keep going. Think no further than the next footfall and the comrades at your elbow. Also, pls share any images, videos or literature you may know of that concern spooky forests. I am reaching the end of my supply of synonyms for "root".</p>
