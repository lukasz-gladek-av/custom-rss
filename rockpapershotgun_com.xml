            <p>An Assassin's Creed level designer has claimed that Ubisoft have put him on unpaid disciplinary leave for speaking out publicly against the company’s recently introduced requirement that staff return to the office full-time.</p>
<p>The level designer in question is David Michaud-Cromp, team lead for level design on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> (which is cited on his LinkedIn with its older “Codename Red” working title). He started at Ubisoft Montreal in 2012, working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, and also has credits on the best-selling Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>.</p>
<p>The backstory: last week, Ubisoft announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelling a load of games</a> and laying off staff in the course of transforming themselves into the New Hotness with funding from Tencent. They also announced that they would no longer allow hybrid or remote working, with staff receiving a yearly allowance of work from home days, instead. An executive commented that “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.” Unionised Ubisoft developers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">not convinced</a>.</p>
<p>Michaud-Cromp offered his own thoughts on the RTO policy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420149620619509761/">a LinkedIn post from 23rd January</a>. "Last week, So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they "believe in collaboration"... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…" he wrote.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D6Tml2ZTCo">a Youtube video</a> from Damon Cassidy, which argues that RTO policies are better understood as “a way to maintain oversight and reinforce traditional hierarchies”, while propping up office real estate prices.</p>
<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, Ubisoft haven’t reacted well to his taking a public stance on RTO, though I’m not sure which specific comments he’s referring to. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-share-7422041590346661889-7e3C/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">a LinkedIn post from yesterday</a>, he writes that: “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty,” the post continues.</p>
<p>“I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>I’ve asked Ubisoft for a statement. I've seen a couple other Ubisoft developers speaking up about the RTO policy and wider cutbacks - in the circumstances, it's probably best not to name them. In other news, Ubisoft are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposing up to 200 layoffs</a> at Ubisoft Paris, even as unionised workers ready themselves for another strike.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> developers Embark have warned players that the two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> have been hit by "extensive, co-ordinated DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks". The studio said these attacks were "ongoing" in a post put out at 11:59 AM GMT today.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> and The Finals have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks," Embark community manager Ossen wrote in said post to the Arc Raiders' official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1466040083780997211">Discord server</a>. "The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-rips-out-one-of-the-games-most-maddening-puzzles">yesterday's update</a>, we hope to have that available later today. We'll update you all on progress as we have more information to share!"</p>
<p>Since that point, Embark have pushed the hotfix live, fixing bugs which were reducing guns' rates of fire and slowing down looting. Their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1466080648522498190">latest post</a> as of writing reads: "We are noticing that servers are recovering. Thanks for your patience and please let us know if you notice any more issues."</p><p>So, judging by that, the situation should now be on the mend if you're hoping to jump into a match later today. Naturally, there's no word yet as to the source of such attacks, which come just after the deployment of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">Headwinds update</a>. It's typical, isn't it. The ice of winter thaws, and boom, a swirling storm of server issues slides right in. </p>
<p>How are you supposed to check out the extra birds Embark say they've added to the Buried City map? Hang on, maybe the DDoSing's down to some Dusky Tits and Dark-rumped Swifts deciding they'd rather not have their nests nicked from.</p>

            <p>The Korean arm of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-mini-pcs">mini PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld</a> producers Zotac have shared an assessment of the ongoing memory shortage crisis that makes for bleak reading – even by RAMnarök standards. In a seemingly legitimate <a href="https://tagtag.co.kr/article/%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80%EC%82%AC%ED%95%AD/1/30215/">post on their Korean retail site</a>, spotted and translated by TXiXXeR user <a href="https://x.com/harukaze5719/status/2015970334873456952">harukaze5719</a>, Zotac Korea write that "The current situation is extremely serious – serious enough to raise concerns about the very survival of graphics card manufacturers and distributors going forward."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, and you can imagine me desperately sobbing while doing do, memory chips and the components they’re used in – which span RAM sticks, SSDs, and graphics cards – are being traded en masse by tech companies planning to build large-scale architecture for AI products. This has caused both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">a shortage and ballooning prices</a>, especially on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">home PC side</a> of the hardware business, with some consumer brands running out of stock or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">shutting down entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Zotac, or at least someone at Zotac Korea, evidently fears the same fate. harukaze5719’s translation, which broadly matches my own machine translations of the post, adds that "Memory supply remains constrained, and it has been announced that GPU supply volumes will also be reduced.</p>
<p>"In addition, several models are expected to be unavailable for an extended period of time."</p>
<p>The post then notes that prices of Nvidia graphics processors, from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review">RTX 5090</a> to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a>, have suffered "substantial" price hikes, which will in turn drive up the end costs of their fully-built graphics cards. Zotac’s UK representatives have not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The GPU industry has endured shortages before; back in 2020 and 2021, when we all thought crypto mining was the worst thing that could happen to PC components, waiting lists for GeForce cards ran into the months. But then, even with the manufacturing difficulties posed by Covid, much of that scarcity was down to finished cards being insta-bought as soon as they appeared in retailers, so everyone involved still got paid. Component shortages caused by a lack of the memory chips needed to build them are a different problem, and one that consumer-facing hardware companies are struggling to find an answer for.</p><p>It’s all terrible, basically. Not everyone is so pessimistic: Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, whose outfit rely on GPU, RAM, and SSD supplies for their Blade laptop series, recently expressed a belief that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-goes-up-must-come-down-razers-ceo-says-of-rising-ram-and-gpu-prices-but-admits-it-is-bad-right-now">prices would come down naturally</a>. But then, Razer’s big reveal as CES was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">captive AI anime woman in a box</a>, which seems like a worse display of judgement than doomposting on the company retail account.</p>
