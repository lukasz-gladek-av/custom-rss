            <p>In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lili">Lili</a> looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/her-story">Her Story</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telling-lies">Telling Lies</a>. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.</p>

<p>"Lili will plunge you into a stylized vision of modern Iran, where surveillance and authoritarianism are part of daily life," said the RSC in <a href="https://www.rsc.org.uk/news/macbeth-inspired-video-game-lili">a press release</a>. "The gameplay will feature a blend of live-action cinema within an interactive game format, so you can immerse yourself in the world of Lady Macbeth and make choices that influence her destiny."</p>
<p>Yep, that sounds very much like the work of Half Mermaid. But in this case the game is being co-created with New York studio iNK Stories, who made the Telltale-esque adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1979-revolution-black-friday">1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a>. In that historical adventure you play a young photographer caught up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-1979-revolution-black-friday">the dangerous winds of the Iranian revolution</a>. As far as choosing a studio to work with, it's a sensible match.</p>
<p>The game will star Zar Amir, who played the lead role as an investigative journalist in 2022 crime thriller Holy Spider. I haven't seen it, but the performance was good enough to win her an award at Cannes. The actor will be "drawing on her lived experience as an Iranian woman in exile who has courageously confronted her own battles against authoritarian gendered oppression," say the RSC. The game is due to "enter production in late 2025" , they say. </p><p>There's no shortage of snoop 'em ups that use a fictional OS as a way to get the player to trawl through a mystery. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orwell">Orwell</a> saw you investigating people as an agent of the state. The more light-hearted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a> had you policing an alternate history internet of spinning GIFs and personal blogs. And of course Telling Lies saw you scrobbling through old video calls to make sense of the lives of four strangers and how they're related. But Lili is probably the first to use the same vehicle to retell a Shakespeare play. As the bard famously said: "I shall wishlist thee when thee drops on Steam."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Burning question answered ahead of RTX 5090 and 5080 launch</p>

            <p>Some eager beavers who bought the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">GeForce RTX 4090</a> at launch were, quite infamously, rewarded for their investment with a defective power adapter, one that that could <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/some-of-nvidias-rtx-4090-power-adapters-are-err-melting">melt the plastic in their £1679 graphics card</a> like it was Ronald Lacey’s face. Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">RTX 5090 and RTX 5080</a>, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean site <a href="https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qn_report/views/444251">Quasar Zone</a> (and machine-translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confident-that-rtx-50-series-power-connectors-unlikely-to-melt-despite-higher-tdp">Tom’s Hardware</a>), Nvidia execs fielded an audience question at an AI-focused RTX in Seoul, asking whether the new GPUs had fixed the singeing issue. "I don't expect that to happen with the RTX 50 series," came the response (Quasar Zone doesn’t name the speaker). "We made some changes to the connectors to address the issue at the time, and I understand that the issue has not occurred in about two years."</p>
<p>Mystery Graphics Man is referring to a redesigned power adapter that replaced the original, melty one not long after its destructive tendencies became widely known. Sure enough, this led to reports of incinerated RTX 4090s largely drying up, and while many of the defective cables did remain in the wild – and have still been causing trouble in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQwlgx0vPbI">more recent times</a> – the fix obviously predates the RTX 50 series. Hence, Nvidia’s confidence that their top-spec cards won’t melt down again.</p>

<p>I’ve spent much of this week playing with an RTX 5090 for a very imminent review, and for what it’s worth... actually, does this violate the embargo? If I say something <em>didn’t</em> catch fire? Is that bad form? Nah screw it, mine hasn’t caught fire. But then, neither did my RTX 4090 review unit, so maybe I’m just lucky. Hopefully that luck will hold as Nvidia’s NDA enforcement team tactically breach my flat with flashbang grenades.</p><p>Less encouraging for the RTX 50 series’ launch, scheduled for January 30th, are a growing number of warnings over available stock levels. PowerGPU, a US-based seller of prebuilt gaming PCs, <a href="https://x.com/PowerGPU/status/1881758554836877675">Xeeted</a> that the RTX 5090 will be "the worst" on availability, with stock problems potentially lasting for at least three months. Here in the UK, meanwhile, Overclockers – one of the biggest gaming PC hardware retailers – <a href="https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/threads/patience-if-planning-to-buy-a-50-series.18998084/#post-37602115">warned on their forums</a> that they only have a few hundred RTX 5080s and "single digit" RTX 5090s, just one week before launch. A return to the misery of 2020’s RTX 30 series shortage and subsequent megainflation? No way. I’m not going back. I’M NOT GOING BACK THERE. No, not you, officers, I’m talking about the stock levels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
