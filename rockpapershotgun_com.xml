            <p>Long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a> director, producer, and general advocate for the virtual graps Katsuhiro Harada has announced he's leaving Bandai Nanco at the close of 2025. Harada's opted to step away as the fighting series turns 30, though he does have one more guest appearance at the Tekken World Tour finals lined up early next year. He's also released an hour-long DJ mix on Soundcloud to commemorate the occasion, making up for the fact he never got around to DJing live at a Tekken tournament.</p>

<p>"With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," the developer announced on Twitter.</p>
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect," he added "Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator'. During that period, I sought advice from [former Sony Computer Entertainment CEO] Ken Kutaragi — whom I respect as though he were another father — and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><p>My roots lie…</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Harada added that he's spent the past five years or so gradually handing over all of his responsibilities, as well as custodianship of Tekken's stories and world, to the rest of Bandai's Tekken team.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">put out a statement</a> on behalf of Tekken 8's developers, thanking Harada and assuring players "that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8." "We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide," that statement continues.</p><p>Heading back to Harada's goodbye post, the veteran developer wrote that he'll share more info about his next steps "at a later date". For now, he left things off by sharing an hour-long DJ mix he's created and popped on Soundcloud. "For 30 years I kept saying, 'I’ll do it someday,' and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event," the dev explained. "So instead, I will be releasing — for the first and last time — a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement. Listening to it brings back many memories."</p>
<p>You can give the DJ mix, dubbed 'TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix' <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix">here</a>. I can confirm the first five minutes are very funky.</p>

            <p>Open your mouth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>. Ah, it's as I suspected, you've eaten the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>! Don't worry, I don't blame you. You were only hungry, and the modders controlling your great maw were keen to see how Melinoë would cope with taking on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> run through the underworld which Zagreus blazes through in the first game.</p>

<p>Fittingly, then, the mod (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/theres-a-mod-that-lets-you-play-hades-1-in-hades-2/">Poseidon Chronos Gamer</a>) which adds that underworld run path to Hades 2 is called Zagreus Journey. With it installed, Melinoë'll be able to head through a chaos manhole out of the crossroads located between the two doors leading to her usual paths. Jumping into this new exit sees the princess of the underworld emerge in Tartarus, then fight through Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx, battling all the same enemies Zag once did. Naturally, though, this time you'll be slapping them up with Mel's abilities and Hades 2's selection of boons.</p>
<p>Zagreus doesn't feature in combat, but he does pop in to handle all of the dialogue, delivering lines from the first game while Melinoë stands silently by his side. Get all the way to the end, and you'll get to see how the talents Mel's honed battling the time bloke and those besieging Olympus stack up against her dear old dad, Hades.</p><p>The modder behind this splicing of two mythical smitings, Nikkel Mollenhauer, writes in its description that they do have plans to add in some new story beats and dialogue between Melinoë and other Hades 2 characters about the new route at some point down the line. That'll serve as a fresh epilogue of sorts, since the modder reccomends you wait until you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-post-launch-patch-1-revamps-melinoes-true-ending-and-is-out-now-in-steam-preview-form">the game's true ending</a> before taking the underworld plunge. Fresh incantations that'll enable meta-progression on the new route, erebus gates, and extra boons are also on their future to-do list, as well as getting the original Hades' secret boss fight up and running.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving their work a go, you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes?tab=readme-ov-file">Github</a> or <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/">Thunderstore</a>. You'll need to zap all of your other current Hades 2 mods to get it working, as well as make sure you've got both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">Hades 2</a> and the original Hades installed in a place the mod can find them.</p>
