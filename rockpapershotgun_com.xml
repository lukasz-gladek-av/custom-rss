            <p>Co-op shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> added its third enemy faction, the Illuminate, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">back in December</a>. Now the alien squids are headed towards Super Earth itself, and to counteract this latest threat to democracy developers Arrowhead are giving soldiers new ways to customise their weaponry.

<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">explained on the PlayStation blog</a>, the new update adds weapon customisation for all primary weapons, letting you complete missions and pay in-game currency to unlock attachments and skins. "Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield," says the post.
</p>
<p>These newly tweakable weapons are proposed as a response to Illuminate heading towards Super Earth, and doing so with newly added enemy types. That includes "the Stingray", a flying enemy that can perform strafing runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>; "the Crescent Overseer", which can drop explosives on Helldivers behind cover; and the Fleshmob, a "Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy."
</p>
<p>"Voteless parts" is good. Good marketing, marketer.
</p>
<p>The in-game store has also been amended to offer items permanently, rather than only a rotating time-limited selection, meaning that you can now go pickup that fascist dandy cape you missed first time around. I like when developers decide to stop preying upon FOMO.

            <p>
I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> since its announcement three years ago, Nomura <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1905427039227887864">hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit</a> in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you didn't know, Magic the Gathering is getting an entire Final Fantasy themed set that will probably single handedly get many people into Magic the Gathering. Yesterday, a whole bunch of cards from the set were revealed, including some special ones with fancy art. Unsurprisingly, everyone's favourite long-haired, long-sworded Sephiroth is a card with two bits of art, one with his regular look, the other his final boss form. It's that second one, "Safer Sephiroth", that Nomura has commented on that has me, and many others, wondering if it's actually a nod toward <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> 3 (or whatever it's called).
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card. I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked," Nomura explained. "There is also a reason that the design for Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."
</p>
<p>
Of course you can't share more about that, Nomura! When can you! Why even bring it up in the first place? I doubt most people would have even noticed, and now you're going to be fueling fan theories for the next two years. In case you don't know what Safer Sephiroth looked like in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, his right arm was just a wing. In this new art, he has both arms and that wing.
</p>
<p>
What could this mean? Maybe it's to keep Cloud and co out of arm's way (sorry)? Mostly, I have no clue, I'm just quite tickled by the fact that Nomura seems to get a kick out of dropping comments like these. Anyway, I'm off to sell a couple of organs to be able to afford a few booster boxes of this set because I do actually want that Sephiroth card!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-terraria-collab-is-coming-this-summer-though-i-have-some-questions-about-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Crossovers! Collabs! Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled "Tides of Terraria" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as "large", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. "The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518587145533786079">Steam post</a> about the update.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, so you can thank Mario for this one.
