            <p>It's been so long since the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a> that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space. I'm pretty sure at least one of those things is from some other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game universe. Maybe Worms. How long must we wait for a Starcraft 3? A long time yet, but possibly not forever, for Blizzard are apparently handing the rights to the cherished RTS series to Nexon, publisher of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean finance site <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (via Google translation) and written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/">PCGamer</a>, Nexon have been selected as the "preferred" candidate for Starcraft development rights following a bidding war with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publisher NCSoft, Solo Leveling: Arise creators Netmarble and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> outfit Krafton. Nexon are also, it's claimed, in the running to land Korean and Japanese service rights for a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> mobile game, referred to by some bidders as Overwatch 3, but in actuality a MOBA spin-off.</p>
<p>According to MTN, the bidders have pitched several new Starcraft concepts at Blizzard, ranging from spin-off games to "platforms", though it's not known what Nexon specifically proposed. Apparently, the negotiations have been "complicated" by the fact that while making a new RTS game is the obvious choice and doubtless the best usage of the license, nobody wants to go toe-to-toe with Blizzard's own Starcraft 2, which remains a huge hit in South Korea despite <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/608542-the-death-of-korean-sc2-and-where-we-go-from-here">reports of its "death" as an esport</a>. There's also been talk of a MOBA adaptation, as with Overwatch mobile. Good luck selling that to the Windows 98 diehards.</p>
<p>Why aren't Blizzard themselves making a new Starcraft RTS? Who knows, such a project may exist deep within the company, lost in a trove of Diablo 4 merchandise, but all they're talking about at present <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">is the latest Quixotic effort to make a Starcraft shooter</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
You know, I don't think I'll ever understand why, after finding a huge amount of surprise success, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> decided to stop working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> all so that they could make a sequel. Perhaps that's just part of my general confusion towards live service games as a whole, but I do think it's a bit odd all the same. Still, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is still on track for a 2025 release it seems, with a date now set for the game's first open beta.
</p>

<p>
As confirmed in a very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be getting an open beta next month, May 22nd. In terms of content, there will apparently be 25 plus weapons, including the "brand new Borealis, an energy carbine power weapon", 10 plus modes like Takedown, a mode returning from the first game where "teams battle to eliminate all members of the opposing team before they can respawn", and 15 plus maps, including a couple of 24-player Onslaught maps.

Actually, hang on, scratch that, as both the trailer and a press release notes that there'll be "infinite" maps. The trailer didn't elaborate on that, and the press release said that 1047 "promise to reveal exactly what that means soon." Judging from the trailer itself, and the fact this was a feature in the first game, it'll be a map editor. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, that would still mean a finite amount of maps, as just because there would theoretically be a regular supply of them, you could still put an exact number as to how many there are. Perhaps there's some kind of randomly generated map feature instead, I don't know, I realise I'm being very particular about this, I just don't appreciate hyperbole. No details on how to sign-up just yet either, so you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled.
