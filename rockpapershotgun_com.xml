            <p>Right, so, Starcraft. A new shooter in the series is reportedly set to be revealed this year, possibly as the big headline act of Blizzcon in September.</p>
<p>The existence of such a secret shootery thing in the works at Blizzard was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">first reported</a> by Jason Schreier last year, being one of the revelations to come out of his book on the publisher, titled Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, now a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> claims that said Starcraft shooter is "most likely" going to headline Blizzcon 2026, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> expansions expected to take the snowy stage alongside it.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of details for this latest report, but Schreier's reporting from last year did reveal that - at least as of the time of his book's publication - long-time FarCry producer Dan Hay is heading up the project. Asked about like likelihood of this Starcraft shooter making it out into the wild by IGN around the same time, Schreier said the following:</p>
<blockquote>If it’s not canceled. This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good. Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</blockquote>
<p>He added that it "felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include, because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> shooters, they just can't say goodbye to them." Indeed, as this'd be the third time acting as the charm for such a game. Nihilistic Software’s  StarCraft GhostGhost was announced in 2002, put on hold in 2006, and later canned. Then, a shooter named codenamed Project Ares was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-cancelled-starcraft-fps">reported to have been cancelled</a> in 2019, with Blizzard's focus pulled towards Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p><p>As a young whippersnapper who's never Starilly Crafted, I've got no strong feelings about any of this, but I do hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-starcraft-game-is-on-the-way-from-the-publishers-of-dave-the-diver-and-the-finals-according-to-reports">Edwin can be spared</a> having to write more lines like "It's been so long since the last Starcraft that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space."</p>

            <p>
Last January, our reviewer Brendan "Shitty Shitty Wham Bam" Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">called</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> "a sordid sim of piss and pistons that won't hold your disgusting little hand", proceeding to warn that it "will either scare you off with its complexity or induce Stockholm syndrome with its mesmerisingly neglectful approach". Out now in early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-winter-car">My Winter Car</a> is all of that plus the "terrible coldness and darkness of Finnish winter", in the words of developers Amistech Games.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The devs add that "it is hard to keep a track even of the time of the day. World around seems to go forward, but player is spiraling even deeper in the pit he was establishing already in the original game." Awesome! In context, the presence of a generative AI disclosure on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4164420/My_Winter_Car/">the Steam page</a> feels entirely appropriate, like luxuriously urinating all over a deep-frozen turd sandwich.
</p>
<p>
The premise seemingly remains that you are trying to fix up a horrible car without dying of immolation, dehydration, lightning strike, and falling off your moped, amongst other foul ends. Now, you also have to worry about pervasive ice and snow. The "cinematic" teaser video below is insultingly opaque, showing only a man in a bobble hat having a smoke next to a covered trailer, in vague echo of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3d8sjh/what_is_the_story_behind_iwata_and_the_bananas/">contemplating a banana</a>, except that My Winter Car is unlikely to be rich in either potassium or wholesome, Nintendo-ish fun. Regarding the developer's comment about losing track of time above, it's worth noting that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utsjoki">parts of Finland</a> in winter where the sun doesn't rise for months.

<p>
There was a pinch of genAI stuff in the original My Summer Car, too. It appears to be more prevalent this time. "Some base textures have been AI generated during the development," the devs note in their disclosure. "Some of the imagery and speech audio in the in-game TV programs are AI generated. Some in-game radio music is AI generated."</p><p>Honestly, the use of AI generation for a game like My Winter Car is a frightfully unreadable escalation of the debate around generative AI. Much as I despise the bigger mass market implementations of the tech for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">corrosive and reductive effect on art and culture</a>, that very infamy makes genAI a good fit for a game that, as Brendy wrote, appears borne of putrid misanthropy and "snickering schadenfreude". I have a terrible feeling that a My Generated Car game would do well, however unlikely to appear on any NVIDIA showcases.
