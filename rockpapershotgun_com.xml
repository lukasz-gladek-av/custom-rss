You cannot pet the dog in Dunderbeck, but you can assuredly eat the unicorn. Just drag its corpse over the puckering mouth on the righthand side. Alternatively, you can chuck the dead unicorn into the mincers on the left and combine the resulting horny horsemeat with other sources of... nutrition, such as rainbow-coloured turds and spoons. I do not know what foodstuffs might result. I refuse to play Dunderbeck’s demo. I watched 20 seconds of the trailer, then spent the next ten minutes brushing my teeth. Here you go.

Dunderbeck is an atypically nauseating inventory management autobattler. It puts you in charge of a jovial exterminator, plying the sweaty streets of Cincinnati, Ohio. Dunderbeck walks automatically along the top of the screen, fighting creatures that range from everyday 'pests' to mythical beasts. You, meanwhile, have the pleasure of arranging and processing any items scooped up enroute, so as to keep Dunderbeck fighting fit. 
</p>
<p>
The challenge with such games is generally a mix of timing and spatial reasoning. In this case, you’ll also have to resist the urge to vom. Dunderbeck himself may puke if you feed him anything unholy, but he, at least, can devour his own sick for unspecified benefits - or simply because he's a disgusting shithead. The pitch is that everything can be eaten “at least once”. What’s more, everything can serve as a weapon: just pop it into the clutching hands beneath the gnashing maw on your HUD.
</p><p>
“Your job is to fight that mess, build with that mess and - I'm sorry to say - eat that mess,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477750/Dunderbeck/">the Steam page</a>. “It's a dirty job, but that's how the sausage is made.” The demo includes two of the game’s townships, which range from forest environments to sewers. The full game includes “over 120 recipes, each requiring one of over 120 items”. That’s 120 too many, as far as I’m concerned. Still, I am not your doctor or licensed nutritionist - I cannot reasonably deny you your fill of unicorn rat-atouille. If you enjoy optimising inventories but don't have a taste for rodents, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a> instead.

            <p>
Once again it appears that Pocketpair appears to be going after a bit of Pokemon's pie, this time of the card game variety. Where the latter's started life as a physical medium, the former's attempt at such a thing, literally just called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> Official Card Game, announced today, looks to be of the digital-only variety, though what there is to learn about it is a touch slim overall.
</p>
<p>
There is a small teaser trailer to bear witness to, but to be honest that barely shows off the cards itself. You will see in the opening shot a card of Wooloo- sorry, Lamball, with some quite lackluster card art. The rest of the trailer is just glowing, artless cards summoning forth different Pals, so perhaps there's a bit more of a Yu-Gi-Oh! vibe going on here? Especially considering matches appear to be just held in the regular Palworld overworld.

Some further details confirmed in a little blog post on the game's official site explain that it's a two player competitive card game "where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals. Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory."
</p><p>
To me that sounds like it could be anything from a tower defence type situation, or even semi-autobattler, but who knows, not a lick of proper gameplay was shown off. Presumably some will come soon at least, as the game already has a release date: July 30th, later this year. It's also being made with card game maker Bushiroad, so at least someone with some experience is involved. Probably also worth noting that there's been no direct confirmation of a PC release just yet, but a console release hasn't been confirmed either, and the base game's on PC, so this seems like a shoo-in.

            <p>Just before the calendar ticked over to 2026, Witcher and Cyberpunk makers CD Projekt revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cd-projekt-red-sells-gog-platform-to-co-founder-for-25-million">sold off their PC storefront</a> - GOG. In a deal worth 90.7 million Polish zloty (about £18.6 million / $25 million), original CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński bought the storefront and has now offered some words about his vision for its future in a Steam-dominated market.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to RPS' tie-wearing and LinkedIn-browsing corporate sibling <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Kiciński argued that the ideal approach to thriving in a universe that's home to Valve's puffing and whistling baby isn't imitating it, but making sure GOG continues to stand out.</p>
<p>That commitment to getting classic games working on modern hardware and working to maintain them? It ain't going anywhere. Neither is the store's firmly anti-DRM stance, with Kiciński neatly summing up the issue of such software continuing to be pushed by declaring: "most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions". That said, the exec was clear Steam's success does highlight areas in which GOG will be striving to do better going forwards. "Steam is winning with its ease of use," he said. "In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general."</p>
<p>On the flipside, there are things GOG's current makeup facilitates which Kiciński reckons are key to the strength of what it offers the would-be PC game buyer. "GOG is a very curated platform. This is, I think, one of our strengths: we don't release hundreds of games daily, 95% of which are really not super high quality, he said, adding that this relative lack of overwhelming rat race compared to Steam's ever-raging battle for eyes can be a boon for smaller developers. If you've got something with unique flair that might struggle to break through the noise and reach players open to giving it a go, maybe being a bigger fish in a smaller pond is better. Or so is the idea here.</p><p>While GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski did point out in this chat that the store are "getting better at getting new games" with each passing year, packing releases from the current year alongside their calling card good old games, Kiciński was clear that competing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-ancient-behemoths-face-increased-competition-from-new-games-in-the-stores-2025-money-making-rankings">the likes of Steam in that area</a> in future isn't the goal. Though, he wouldn't commit to anything concrete when asked about a previously floated idea which could be a natural way for GOG to double down on classics instead - making their own remasters in a similar fashion to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">System Shock Remake</a> devs Nightdive Studios.</p>
<p>That path very much isn't being ruled out, though. "It's very close to what I've said about development and publishing, being close to those processes," Kiciński said. "We have a very big talent pool in Poland in that regard. So it feels very natural to grow in that direction, but it's too early to say any concrete things."</p>
<p>Given hosting big mods - including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> and still in-the-works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - has been another growing string to GOG's bow in recent years, I'm personally hopeful its new ownership will keep that ball rolling too. After all, it's another area Valve's behemoth doesn't have totally locked down, even if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-workshop-mods-should-hopefully-suffer-less-update-induced-hassle-thanks-to-new-version-control-tools">Steam Workshop</a> continues to be modding hub of choice for certain games.</p>
