            <p>I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Workshop will let players download and share maps, campaigns, new weapons and gadgets that they've added to the game, although ambitious modders will need to know the Lua scripting language to implement their changes. It looks like the map editor is pretty friendly, however, given the 2D tile-based levels.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of topdown games that aim to walk in Hotline Miami's bloody footprints, but Intravenous 2 differs by going deep on tactical elements. You can stealth through the levels if you choose: enemies of vision cones, you can hide in shadows, and you can manipulate the environment by turning off lights, lockpicking doors, or using items to distract or lure enemies.
</p>
<p>You can also tinker with your skills and weaponry. There are 29 weapons according to the Steam page - although whether that's been updated to reflect those added in updates such as this one, I don't know - and those weapons can be customised with suppressors, laser sights, ammo types and so on.
</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Intravenous 2 brags that its storyline is dynamic and changes based on your style of play. I don't know how far it follows through with that, but I'm interested in giving it a go just because I love stealth games and tactical combat. I've had good experiences with topdown games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/door-kickers">Door Kickers</a>, and I'd be onboard with a less fiddly, more action-oriented take on a similar experience. Topdown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, as opposed to topdown SWAT? I dare to dream.
</p>
<p>One day, one day I will find time to play it. For now: hey, it's cool that its got mod support. All games should have mod support. You can find more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608270/Intravenous_2/">on Steam</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sons-of-the-forest">Sons Of The Forest</a> is about being chased by fithy cannibals who cannot swim, so the latest update ought to be useful to players. Its major new feature is the addition of rafts, which players can construct and then float about on like a 2000s Tom Hanks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rafts come in three flavours ranging from small, slightly less small, to a full on houseboat with walls and ceilings. All three can be tied to the shore with a new mooring structure, and otherwise paddled about the lakes and waterways of the island.
</p>
<p>There are some other neat new features, too. Players can now draw plans for defensive walls around their base and leave Kelvin to do the hardwork of constructing them. Kelvin also now has a faster swim animation and both he and Virginia are able to pull themselves out of water at its edge, both of which seem useful when they inevitably fall off your raft.
</p>
<p>If you make the mistake of ever coming back to land, there are apparently impprovements to aiming with the crossbow, compound bow, crafted bow, shotgun and slingshot, all of which you'll see while scrabbling to survive against the cannibals.
</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280">patch notes are available over on Steam</a>. We already liked the game plenty when it hit 1.0 early last year, as Matt Cox (RPS in peace) explained in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sons-of-the-forest-review">Sons Of The Forest review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
