            <p>Oh, Netflix's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/the-witcher">The Witcher TV series</a> is back with its fourth series next month, following a lengthy hiatus that's seen Geralt regenerate from Henry Cavill into Liam Hemsworth. The new series premieres in late October, and first official looks at both the HemsGerry and Laurence Fishburne as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine">Blood and Wine</a> vampire Regis have been offered.</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, I thought, when I scrolled past this news on one of the screens in my Adrian Veidt-esque world-watching setup - Laurence Fishburne's in it? Yep, it seems that after not getting around to watching the third series, I've managed to completely blot out all knowledge that the actor behind The Matrix's pill distributor is being cast in The Witcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Netflix announced season four's October 30th arrival date yesterday, amid some sort of boxing fight that I'm sure paled in comparison to the scrap Gerry has with a Skelligean bear in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. With it came the first proper clip of Liam Hemsworth portraying Geralt, after Henry Cavill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/henry-cavill-will-be-replaced-as-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-four">opted to make series three his last in the role</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure new Geralt staring at a wraith that springs out of a tomb like a jack-in-the-box, before he casually removes its heart like someone gently unplugging a table lamp was meant to be as funny as I've found it. But otherwise it's a decent, if pretty unremarkable, first glimpse at Hemsworth killing monsters.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Continent awaits. Here’s your exclusive first clip of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher Season 4. Returns 30th October, only on Netflix. <a href="https://t.co/CTvryeUmRd">pic.twitter.com/CTvryeUmRd</a></p>— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1967038088867102733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, official photos have been put out, with one being of Fishburne as Regis, while others show Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan continuing as Yennefer and Ciri respectively. I'll be honest, seeing what the former does is one of the few things that might persuade me to get back into this Witcher adaptation. I watched the first couple of series right after they came out, and while they certainly weren't terrible, they didn't grab me enough to stick around through series three.</p>
<p>There's a good chance part of that's just down to my enjoyment of The Witcher being much more firmly rooted in wielding the twin swords myself via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">CD Projekt's games</a>. I've read the books, but their tales aren't the main thing that got me into Gerald from the Riviera's adventures. Ok, you got me, I just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-netflixs-witcher-isnt-based-on-the-games-why-that-shot-of-geralt-in-the-bath">shots of hairy fantasy lads in the bath</a>. That said, given the hiatus and departure of the series' primary face in Cavill, Hemsworth's got a tough task convincing those who were on the fence after series three.</p>
<p>Best of luck to him given that unenviable position, as well as both Chalotra and Allan, who I reckon did really well with what they were given in the first two series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-took-about-10-minutes-to-write">toss a coin song bloke</a>, can't forget about him either.</p>

            <p>Some weeks, finding new games for the Maw is like scouring a village of octogenarians for the last remaining virgin to throw into a rumbling volcano. You awkwardly pop the question during a dozen hastily organised afternoon tea dates, and riffle through family trees in desperation as the air thickens with sulphur.</p>
<p>This week, it's like the mountainside has been invaded by a horde of teenage firebugs. Stop shoving! Form an orderly queue! You are going to give the volcano <em>constipation</em>. Here's a moderately curated round-up of the most promising specimens. May they burn brightly and stave off the magma for at least another seven days.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developers Gearbox have chucked more wrenches at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s PC performance over the weekend, following issues that've landed it mixed Steam review fortunes since launch last week. However, if you're looking for patch notes, you're gonna be a bit disappointed. Ah well, at least there are essay-length Randy Pitchford Twitter threads to scroll through if you're partial to someone waffling about how the game runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Initially, Gearbox's response to the PC performance problems was to publish a massive recommended settings table. Our James had a go at seeing if following it made a tangible difference. While you can and should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">read his full testing write-up </a>, the short version is that the stuttering many players have reported wasn't magically wiped away by that guidance.
</p>
<p>Cue this latest update, which as Gearbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802578411?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>, aims to "help improve stability for a wide range of PCs". Unlike most patches, they declined to get into any nitty-gritty specifics beyond that. There's a warning that whenever you change your graphics settings, it can take up to 15 minutes for your shaders to recompile, as well as a reposting of those optimisation guides for <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/amd-optimization/">AMD</a> hardware.</p>
<p>Aside from those, the studio added: "We’re continuing to read your feedback, planning additional updates and will have more details to come". So, no bullet-pointed patch notes to illustrate exactly how the update's gone about trying to make things run in a more stable fashion, which seems a strange choice and has understandably raised eyebrows among <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngje07/borderlands_4_update_notes/">some</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngdo16/bl4_new_patch_steam/">players</a>.</p><p>Who needs full patch notes, however, when you've got Gearbox CEO yammering into the void about Borderlands 4 on the socials. He has at least emphasised that the studio are putting in "significant work on PC performance". Though, that did come midway through an essay-length thread that began with the declaration: "Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>After shouting at anyone who's assumed that PCs between minimum and recommended specs "can achieve all of extremely high frame rate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution", the tweetman asserted that "there are a few real issues, but they are affecting a very, very small percentage of users."</p><p>

In other Borderlands 4 launch-related news, publishers Take-Two took the opportunity to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-no-spyware-in-borderlands-4-take-two-insist-following-upset-over-terms-of-service">reiterate they aren't in the "spyware" business</a> via the game's terms of service agreement. That followed some concern over the contents of such Take-Two docs in terms of data collection earlier this year, with some older Borderlandses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">briefly being review-bombed</a>.
