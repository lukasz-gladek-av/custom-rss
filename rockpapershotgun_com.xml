            <p>Valve’s quiet bankrolling of open-source emulation tools could make it heaps easier to play your PC games library on a humble smartphone, though it sounds like Gabe-made SteamOS phones are unlikely to be joining the company’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">growing hardware catalogue</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed that they’ve been funding the development of Fex – a free compatibility tool that gets Windows apps functioning on mobile ARM processors – since well before revealing the ARM-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve's bundling Fex into SteamOS so the Frame, due in 2026, can run Steam games straight off the headset’s internal chip. But it is already out in the wild right now – i.e. <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX">GitHub</a> –, and has a promising future in bringing those very same games to Android phones. Just not, Griffais says, phones with a Steam logo on them.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if that’s going to be a big focus for us to develop local content or try to develop SteamOS for devices like that" he explains. "I mean, I’m not discounting any possibility, but I think with just living room, handheld, and desktop, trying to have a good outcome for gaming applications and everything else you’d want to do in a desktop, we have a ton of work to do."</p>
<p>The living room and handheld formats clearly refer to, respectively, the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> and the existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. But these are both based on x86 processors, much like a regular Windows PC or laptop. It’s ARM hardware, the diesel to x86’s unleaded, that Fex and the Frame are trying to crack – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-just-works-valve-talk-the-steam-frame-android-games-on-steamos-and-putting-a-pc-on-your-face">with at least some success</a>, judging by the slickness with which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> ran on the Frame when I tried it at Valve’s offices last month.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Steam phone or no, Fex may fulfil that promise of Steam games on mobile. It is, for instance, one of multiple x86 emulation layers employed by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaoji.egggame&amp;hl=en_GB">Gamehub</a>, an Android game launcher app produced by Chinese peripheral makers GameSir. I’ve tried this on my Pixel 9 and admittedly haven’t had much luck, even with the games I know work well on the Steam Frame: Hades 2 crashes immediately and Silksong gets stuck on an endless launching screen. Also, there’s a non-zero possibility that I’ve handed over my Gmail and Steam account details to the Chinese Communist Party. C'est la vie. You <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamehub">don’t have to look far</a>, mind, for folks who’ve used Gamehub to get Androidified Steam games up and running, including the author of that Verge piece.</p><p>Hopefully this cross-device compatibility push continues apace; Valve obviously have a business interest in getting Steam games (uhhhh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">sorry Horses</a>) playable on as many computery doohickeys as possible, but kicking down compatibility barriers and spreading software across devices of the user’s choosing is good for the common gamesplayer as well.</p>

            <p>
A few weeks ago, developers Beeswax Games released a "spiritual successor" to 2019 freeware game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-players-online">No Players Online</a> on Steam. If you've not played the old freeware project - <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic">still available on Itch</a> - it's one of those haunted software jobbies that accentuate the eerieness of elderly 3D simulation tech, and in this case, abandoned FPS multiplayer maps. I was looking forward to playing the successor. But then, spookily, the Steam page vanished. And now, spookily, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">it's back</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Beeswax, the game was hit by a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim filed by a "former friend" who "claimed to be co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it". Valve then took the game down on 13th November, a week after release. The developers filed a counter-notice, and Valve have now reinstated the Steam release after the complainant neglected to respond to that counter-notice in time.
</p>
<p>
You can read developer Adam Pype's full account of events <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">here</a>. It doesn't name the "former friend", and I'm not going to speculate about their identity. Pype says the upheaval has cost the project dearly, writing that "we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend."
</p>
<p>
Pype continues that "this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we're unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins."
</p><p>
I haven't been keeping up with latest happenings in DMCA-land, but this particular legal institution has attracted much criticism for being easy to abuse. Back in 2017, Alice O (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/river-city-ransom-underground-pulled-from-sale-following-copyright-claims">reported</a> on the yoinking from sale of River City Ransom Underground, commenting that DMCA filings "don't require that the accuser offer proof that they hold the rights, putting the burden of time and effort (and sometimes money) on the accused". More recently in 2023, a community guide writer had ace city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-is-back-on-steam-after-a-dmca-strike-from-disgruntled-player">removed from Steam for a month or so</a>, after developers 3Division added a mode that seemingly took a little inspiration from the writer's work.
</p>
<p>
Natalie Clayton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-players-online-offers-free-spooks-on-the-empty-servers-of-a-dead-multiplayer-game">had a rare old time</a> with No Players Online back in 2019. "No Players Online sees me, booting up old games, looking for that sweet nostalgia kick, and suggests that maybe I let dead things stay buried," she wrote. These cautionary sentiments notwithstanding, I'm thankful that the spiritual successor has escaped the grave of DMCAing. It expands on the freeware game's premise with a faux-90s desktop interface and a bunch of different, presumably cursed games to download from various not-forums.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> won't be getting the final update devs Obsidian had planned for this year. Instead the studio have opted to save putting out the new game plus mode they'd planned for this autumn for a big update to make the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s first birthday in February. To make up the extra wait, the anniversary update'll be adding some mystery extra bits alongside the already announced features.</p>
<p>The autumn patch was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">originally set</a> to be the third update delivered to the nature-rific blunderbuss adventure this year. The last one to arrive was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun">the summer update</a>, which aimed to round out the fighting skills of non-magic users so that wizards weren't having all of the fun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, though, the roadmap has been remapped. No autumn update shall exist, with Obsidian having <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">announced</a> that they're shifting efforts to "a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game’s release". As such, stuff like new game plus, a photo mode, and a new type of weapon will now be arriving around February 18th, having been delayed from their original slot.</p>
<p>As someone who really should get around to replaying Avowed now some time's passed, I'm pretty happy to be able to leave thinking about doing so via new game plus next year, given how packed December always is. The photo mode'll also be a cool addition, given Avowed's vibrant natural scapes are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-avowed">one of the areas</a> in which it really sung. They'll have to pry my arquebus out of my cold, dead mushroom hands to get me to try the new kind of weapon, though.</p><p>Some character customisation additions have also been pushed from this year to the anniversary update. These include the ability to switch up your appearance within the world, as well as more presets for characters and their Godlike features. The Godlike features for the uninitiated, are the mushrooms and bits of wood you can slap across your envoy's face to show that they are the mystical nature-person of legend.</p>
<p>Alongside those announced bits, Obsidian added that you can expect some surprise "additional features" that'll fleash out the anniversary update to make it the game's biggest yet. My money's on a giant mushroom you can peel off your face, then mount to fly around Eora. Or throw at enemies like a pizza-shaped fungi boomerang. Either that or some sort of Outer Worlds 2 crossover which sees the citizens of fantasyland have to fight off an invasion of corporate types whose leader <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2s-faction-writing-falls-short-of-fallout-new-vegas-and-how-it-handles-the-powerful-is-key">the writers feel a bit sorry for</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">$55 billion leveraged buyout</a> which will see Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Jared Kushner become the new owners of EA will reportedly lead to the Saudi Public Investment Fund owning a whopping 93.4 percent of the game publishers. That's assuming the deal goes through as planned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is according to filings with Brazil’s antitrust regulator reported by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall). The other parties in the takeover, investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, are set to receive stakes amounting to 5.5 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The latter company was founded by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Both Silver Lake and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">Affinity</a> already get some of their own investment funding from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Overall, the Saudi PIF are putting up somewhere in the region of $29 billion to make the deal happen, with $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost funded in equity, plus the $5.2 billion worth of EA already owned by the country's wealth fund. The remaining $20 billion will come from a loan set to be dished out by JPMorgan Chase Bank, with generative AI <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">reportedly being viewed</a> as a way of repaying the debt by slashing EA's running costs in the coming years. Sigh.</p><p>All of that's a serious chunk of change for a fund recently reported by the New York Times to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-saudi-arabia-fund-behind-the-wildly-leveraged-ea-buyout-is-dealing-with-financial-distress-claims-report">dealing with some "financial distress"</a>. Though, the fund did disagree with that assessment of their money future, casually declaring that they've got $60 billion in cash and "similar financial instruments" in their wallet.</p>
<p>The question, given how much control of Saudi Arabia stand to gain over EA's direction for owning 93.4 percent via the PIF, is whether there's any truth to claims that EA's day-to-day will go on largely as usual, following the deal. "Our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged," EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/exciting-news-about-our-future?isLocalized=true#:~:text=Our%20values%20and%20our%20commitment,lead%20the%20future%20of%20entertainment.">said in October</a>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's ruling regime, led by Mohammed bin Salman, boast a terrible human rights record which <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">Amnesty International</a> cite as including "arbitrary" detention and execution of people simply expressing their opinions, abuse of migrant workers, and discrimination against women. They're also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">believed by the CIA</a> to have been responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All of that makes the wealth fund gaining majority control of the games publisher worrying, especially given the diversity and inclusiveness studios like BioWare and series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> are noted for.</p>

            <p>
Grotesque and surreal 'farming simulation' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> has been banned from the Epic Games Store on the eve of release, a couple of years after a work-in-progress version of the game was rejected by Valve. In an alleged statement to developers Santa Ragione, the Fortnite makers explain that they've found the game to be in contravention of policies against "Inappropriate Content" and "Hateful or Abusive Content". Given that, according to Santa Ragione, Epic have had access to a build for two months and had already approved the game for publication on their store 18 days before launch, the whole thing feels like a frantic response to Valve's claims about the unfinished build, which Epic presumably haven't seen. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the statement attributed to them, Epic's content reviewers also say that when they piped their findings about Horses through a questionnaire supplied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Age_Rating_Coalition">an international age rating NGO</a>, it told them the game should be rated Adult Only. Horses has already been rated 18 by the Pan-European Game Information system and M for Mature by the Electronic Software Ratings Board, as displayed on the EGS <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Coming Soon page</a>, which is still live as of writing. 
</p>
<p>
AO games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store unless - as the attributed statement reminds us - they've only been rated Adult Only because they have blockchain, NFT or cryptocurrency technology. This is totally fine, because none of those things are reprehensible or controversial, and besides, they probably make more money for Epic than bizarre and disturbing artworks about people dressed as horses.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2iW4SW03F3OfnoXn4E3f4Uf9HXrImI0PqKlr_Syqk8/edit?tab=t.0">According to Santa Ragione</a>, Epic informed the developers that they won't distribute Horses about 24 hours before release, and denied a subsequent appeal 12 hours later. Here's the full reported statement about the ban from Epic, which was sent to RPS over email.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"We are unable to distribute HORSES on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. The 'Inappropriate Content' policy prohibits content which "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated." The 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology)."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The developers say they don't know for sure what pushed Epic to act, but offer a bit of speculation. "Following the announcement of Steam's ban, HORSES became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition," they write. "It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself." Regarding Epic's attributed comments about policy infringement, they write that "no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines".
</p><p>
If you're catching up with all this, Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">went public about Valve banning Horses from Steam around a week ago</a>. According to the developers - with partial confirmation from Valve - Steam's reviewers rejected the game after submission of an unfinished build they felt featured "content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor". 
</p>
<p>
While Valve have offered no further details in public, Santa Ragione speculate that this statement refers to a scene of a farm supplier's daughter riding the shoulders of an enslaved naked woman in a horse mask. They have both rebutted Valve's initial suggestion that the game might contain child sexual abuse material, and changed the scene following Valve's review to make the character a twenty-something woman. They note in general that the scene "deals with the societal structure" of the game's world, and that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." 
</p>
<p>
I've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">reviewed the finished game</a> (at possibly indulgent length - maybe have a toilet break before you dive in) and as regards the final version of that scene, I don't consider this to be any kind of child pornography. I've included screens of it below to give you an idea. To give some broad context, Horses is about violent structural repression and the punishing of sexuality. The "horses" are people deemed to be so immoral they deserve to be treated like livestock. The game is not an endorsement of anything it depicts.
</p>



<p>
As with their response to Valve's rejection of the game, Santa Ragione argue that all of this is just modern-day puritanism in action. "We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists," they write. "Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. These bans passively shape which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."
</p><p>As with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">payment processor crackdown on "adult" or "NSFW" games</a> from earlier this year, my takeaway is that another large corporate institution is reluctantly pantomiming the role of public guardian. As their on-going support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/24/surge-uk-savings-lost-investment-scams-fake-crypto-fraud">scam-ridden technologies</a> with a considerable <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/Emerging_Digital_Assets_Forrest.pdf">environmental cost</a> suggests, Epic aren't really interested in safeguarding morality - it's just a role thrust on them by their control of distribution. I imagine the key equation here is one of reputation management vs likelihood of a CSAM lawsuit vs opportunity for profit.</p>
<p>

Anyway, we'll mail Epic a request for comment. In the meantime, Horses can still be found on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?srsltid=AfmBOoqFrez0g8LRFGKzFB7RvQFaECoPNhRBncRp9ZNhk8_QHZtZ2HQ9">Humble</a>, <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>.
