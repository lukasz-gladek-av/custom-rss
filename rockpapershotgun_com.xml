            <p>
Fancy a kickabout? After launching in the much warmer June (why is it already so cold, it's only bloody September), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a> has finally received its first proper season, elevating it into a true, blue live service game. This comes with, as you may have guessed, a season pass, which comes with a pair of themes for your football stadium, one being iceberg oriented, the other providing a volcanic atmosphere, alongside some new cosmetics too.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the season pass, there are two pretty big additions with this update. First up is crossplay! You know how this works I'm sure, but to spell it out, it means those of you on PC will now be able to play with your console friends, whether you own the game on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. Always a neat thing to have! Then, there's the addition of a 3v3 ranked mode. Typically matches are 5v5, so this will obviously make for a mode with some tactical differences. Sort of like heading to the local park with your mates!

This season also brings some fixes and tweaks through a new patch too. Reactivity and precision should be better now, and whatever the exploit known as the "Ippy Slide" has been nerfed too. Yay? You'll also find that goalkeeper dives have received a rework so that they're more effective against volleys, and as detailed in a press release, "skill-based matchmaking parameters are now stricter, especially in ranked matches, ensuring more evenly matched teams."
</p><p>
Apparently season 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game will also introduce a much more personal 1v1 game mode, and throughout 2026 there'll be new features introduced like clubs and tournaments systems, World Cup-themed events, and "more." Look forward to that, I suppose!
