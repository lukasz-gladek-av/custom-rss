            <p>Make sure the dildos are flying at half mast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> 1 design director Chris Stockman has said he believes the series is "dead", following conversations with Embracer Group about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saints-rows-original-design-director-is-pitching-a-grounded-70s-open-world-prequel-with-absolutely-no-dildobats">his pitch for a prequel</a>. According to the developer, who currently heads VR studio Bit Planet Games, that chatter about a potential Saints Rowssurection post <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-close-volition-developer-of-red-faction-and-saints-row">Embracer's closing of Volition</a> has ended in the publishers ghosting Stockman.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stockman's pitch for a Saints Row comeback - revolving around a trip back to the 70s to unearth how the series' gangs came to be via an adventure with a similar tone to the series first couple of entries - gained traction online late last year. The developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/comment/nm7n1xa/">subsequently revealed</a> current series owners Embracer had expressed interest in hearing him out on it.</p>
<p>Sadly, the latest updates Stockman's offered in chats on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1461431635680559260">Bit Planet's Discord server</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">Europeanvideogamer</a>) don't paint a very rosy picture in terms of how his resuscitation efforts are working out. "I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," he told one user during a January exchange. "I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Also, in case you were wondering, Stockman isn't sure whether Saints Row newslady Jane Valderamma was based on Family Guy newslady Tricia Takanawa. I didn't need to tell you that, but it was the subject of that January Discord chat immediately prior to Stockman dropping the bombshell that he thinks Saints Row's gone the way of the dodo. Boy, sometimes things escalate quickly.</p><p>For what it's worth, the developer's subsequently emphasised in a comment on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1473450909504766115">February 17th</a> that the ball is still very much in Embracer's court if they want to license or contract the Saints Row series out to his studio. However, he says he's "done all I can do to try and make that happen".</p>
<p>So, things are looking bleak if you're holding out for a dildo-batless revival for Saints Row headed up by some series veterans.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that they are making a bunch of new Assassin’s Creed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, together with some unannounced original projects, in a wide-ranging albeit very rehearsed-sounding chinwag with Variety. 
</p>
<p>
In the interview, Guillemot also talked more about Ubisoft’s plan to cut fixed costs by €200 million, as the publishers continue their transformation into a set of “creative houses” grouped around particular games and genres. The transformation has already led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">the cancellation of several games</a> and the closure of two studios, and it sounds like there could be more layoffs on the way.
</p>
<p>
“As we announced, the €200 million in additional cost reductions will include selective restructuring across the company,” Guilemot <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told the site</a>. “That said, our primary focus for aligning the organization with our long-term goals remains disciplined workforce management, meaning prioritizing voluntary departures while carefully controlling recruitment for replacements and new roles.
</p>
<p>
“We are also taking a range of measures to optimize the business: reducing certain expenses, adjusting or stopping projects where necessary, improving production processes, and making more effective use of our tools,” he went on.
</p>
<p>
“Following the post-Covid period, the industry grew very quickly, anticipating sustained demand that didn’t fully materialize. On our part, this led to too many projects and increased complexity. Our priority today is to build a more focused, agile company, with stronger teams that strike the right balance between senior expertise and young talent and who are well positioned to deliver the highest quality games.”
</p><p>
The talk of “disciplined workforce management” might seem a bit risible when you consider that Yves has just appointed his son, Charlie, as co-CEO of Vantage Studios, the creative house that will handle potential “billionaire brands” like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.  
</p>
<p>
Charlie Guillemot has a few years under his belt in executive positions, but doesn’t strike me as anybody’s first choice for the role of Assassin’s Cry Rainbows tsar. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-new-assassins-creed-and-far-cry-games-are-coming-denies-that-putting-his-son-in-charge-of-them-was-nepotism/">PCGamer</a> note, he’s otherwise known for running free-to-play specialists Owlient, creators of an infamous Tom Clancy mobile spin-off that shut down a year after launch, and co-founding AI, web3 and blockchain studio <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#web3">Unagi</a>. Charlie Guillemot doesn’t have any public credits on any of Ubisoft’s would-be “billionaire brands”.</p>
<p>Vantage’s other co-CEO, Christophe Derennes, looks like a stronger fit: he’s the <a href="https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/christophe-derennes-30-years-in-a-booming-industry/">former general manager</a> of Ubisoft Montréal, developers of the original Assassin’s Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> and several Rainbow Six games.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft – founded by the Guillemot brothers in 1986 - have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">batted away allegations of nepotism</a> in the past. Asked by Variety to comment on the subject yet again, Guillemot replied that “Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades.” 
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure the argument that keeping it in the family helps Ubi avoid short-termism really gels with the previous answer about over-expansion during the Covid boom, or with Ubisoft’s repeated investments in NFTs and other flavours of snakeoil.
</p>
<p>
“I strongly believe that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as Co-CEOs of Vantage Studios,” Guillemot went on. “They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role.” 
</p><p>
Ubisoft’s creative houses “will operate like dedicated business units with clear accountability for performance and genuine creative autonomy,” the exec explained. Vantage specifically have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funding from Tencent</a>, but according to Guillemot, the latter “respect our operational autonomy and are not involved in our governance or day-to-day management”. 
</p>
<p>
Whether investors trust the Guillemots to run Ubisoft any longer is somewhat in doubt: the company has weathered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">shareholder revolts</a> over <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=UBI:PAR">the falling stock price</a>. The Guillemots have also been accused of failing to curb a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment">"boy's club" workplace culture</a> that has led to several criminal convictions. I get the sense that decentralising the founding fathers and detoxifying the Ubisoft brand is part of the thinking behind positioning the creative houses as autonomous. Or at least, that was my reasoning before the big boss appointed his son to co-run three of Ubisoft’s most successful series. 
</p>
<p>
They’ll have to do more than that to convince the Ubisoft rank-and-file: around 1200 French Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">went on strike</a> earlier this month in response to the changes of direction and an associated return-to-office policy.

            <p>Tencent have reportedly shut down their TiMi Montreal studio, set up back in 2021 with the goal of creating multi-platform open world games. In those five years, the studio haven't shipped any games, but had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent">brought on</a> former Assassin’s Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail. Ismail was reportedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-creative-director-fired-from-ubisoft-f-1844724819">fired by Ubisoft</a> following an investigation into misconduct, with the developer having been accused of taking advantage of his status to engage in extramarital relationships.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> first reported TiMi Montreal's closure, citing a LinkedIn post from a programmer at the studio. According to the publication, this post asserted that staff had been aware of the impeding closure "for some time" and addded "I am genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing." <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">Links</a> to the post now load to a message which reads "this post cannot be displayed".</p>
<p>I've contacted Tencent for comment. Ashraf Ismail, whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashraf-ismail-5b1919a/">LinkedIn profile</a> lists him as having been a creative director at Timi Montreal since March 2021, contains no references to the studio being closed as of writing.</p>
<p>While the wider Tencent-backed TiMi Studio Group which this Montreal studio was part of has had a large focus on mobile games - such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-empires">Age of Empires</a> Mobile, Pokémon Unite, and Call of Duty: Mobile - the Montreal studio was <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/TiMi-Studio-Group-Opening-Game-Development-Studio-in-Montreal">launched with the specific goal</a> of creating an original "AAA open world, service-focused video game for players to explore across multiple platforms". PC and consoles were first on the list of places for said game to hit, though TiMi Montreal hadn't announced any such game. Meanwhile, TiMi Studio Group have at least published a fairly high-profile shooter on PC in the past couple of years, in the form of Team Jade's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delta-forces-free-black-hawk-down-shooter-campaign-mode-is-out-now">Delta Force</a>.</p>
<p>TiMi Montreal's closure comes as we've seen Chinese giants cut back the substantial efforts they made at Western expansion around the Covid pandemic, with Tencent rival NetEase having <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">made headlines for doing so</a>.</p>
