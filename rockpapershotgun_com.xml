            <p>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sultans-game">Sultan’s Game</a> for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169680/Sultans_Game_Demo/">Steam demo</a> - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a>, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!</p>

<p>The art itself is gorgeous, sitting somewhere between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>’s multi-hued, drive-by horniness and Yoshitaka Amano’s <a href="https://youtu.be/5aoIZtg-isY">1001 Nights</a>, and the soundtrack also does a great job scene setting. For the tutorial - which, I must add, is only really a tutorial for about 30% of the game - you take control of the Sultan. He’s bored of all earthly pleasures, until one day a magician arrives at the door with a box of cards. The cards come in four flavours: carnality, bloodshed, conquest, and extravagance. Each also has a value like 'gold' or 'silver'. To fulfil a card, you need to find a target of equal value to enact it upon. There’s also an option to attempt to bone the tutorial magician, which I picked <em>out of</em> <em>curiosity only</em>. It doesn’t work, anyway.</p>

<p>That the Sultan is a real piece of shit is something I picked up around the time he snapped the neck of the consort with whom he resolved his initial 'carnality' card. The next I got was a gold 'bloodshed' card, which meant I had to personally murder a gold tier character from my court. As you quickly realise, your courtiers here are resources, There’s an almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>-ish efficient tyranny to it all. Many resource management games use some sort of population-as-spendables system, but both the art and the focus in the writing here mean that you do get at least some sense of these characters as people before you 'spend' them on whatever sordid goal the card demands.</p><p>Somewhat mercifully, you don’t actually play as the Sultan after the tutorial, although he is a constant presence. You make a character with a small entourage and an estate on the embroidered map you’ll use to visit various locations and events, and then you’ll draw your first card. You’ve got seven days to resolve it before the Sultan executes you. Once you’ve resolved that card, you get a fresh seven day grace period re: getting your head cut off.</p>

<p>This is where it gets a little complicated, but very broadly, it’s a narrative worker placement game. Your main goal is to turn up whatever event will let you use your card, and in doing so, you’ll end up progressing through little story chains. For an early bloodshed card, I had to convince a dude to like me by gifting him a book, which I bought with cash I earned for having my wife watch my estate. But she also had a high 'wisdom' stat, so I was left wondering if she wouldn’t have been better deployed to the Sultan’s palace to keep an eye on the politicking there. You’re not only trying to resolve cards, but you’ve also got separate trackers for your reputation and influence in the city. Bonus cards like ploys or, say, expensive perfume to use while spying the bathhouse can net you some nice buffs, which usually come in the form of rerolls for other events.</p>
<p>As you can likely tell - it’s a lot. Such a lot that I can’t even fully quantify it’s lot-ness for lack of an adequate reference point for how lot-erly it expands, and how this theoretical lot contains and contextualises all the assorts lot-ness within it. Still, despite only grasping about 90% of the prose due to various translation errors, I think there’s enough here for a tenuous recommendation, providing you’re not too put off by the close proximity in which murder and boning are usually found. It’s very dark, but it also feels very vibrant with ideas. At this early point, at least, there’s a very exciting sense of not knowing quite how deep Sultan’s Game goes, which is one of the Best Videogame Things, imo.</p>

            <p>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were "born in Chornobyl?" as a play on "were you born in a barn?" whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.</p>

<p>Here’s said specs. Every day, we stray further from god, and I stray further from being even remotely satisfied with my current set up.</p>

<p>First up, there’s the 160GB SSD space requirement - a whole 10GB interest on the previously reported size. The minimum RAM requirements have also doubled, from 8GB to 16GB. The previously 'Recommended' specs are now 'Medium', but on the plus side, the minimum specs themselves aren’t too demanding. You'll also have a choice of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">Nvidia DLSS</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">AMD FSR 3.1</a> upscaling, with further potential framerate-juicing from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a> and FSR 3.1 frame generation.</p><p>James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">caught up with GSC’s CEO Ievgen Grygorovych</a> back in September for a chat about how the game reflects Ukraine’s "rebellious" spirit. "We, as Ukrainians, have our own identity," said Grygorovych. "We identify ourselves as Ukrainians. We have a totally different story and identity than other countries around us, and for us. Historically, we’ve been a very rebellious nation, with a lot of revolutions, and those revolutions were mostly moved by the will to be free, and to get more freedom."</p>

            <p>The studio behind sunny third-person adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rime">Rime</a> and time loop murder mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a> has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers-tequila-cancel-game-and-lay-off-staff">cancelled a game last month</a> and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Founders Raúl Rubio and Luz Sancho have left their positions at the company following the insolvency filing, leaving it in the hands of former Chief Operating Officer Térence Mosca, who is now acting as general manager. Mosca says the insolvency is the result of "prolonged market conditions".</p>
<p>"Since its founding in 2009, Tequila Works' game-development philosophy has always focused on 'creating things with gusto'," he said in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency">a statement to Gameindustry.biz</a>. "We are doing everything we can to provide support and guidance to our teams during this difficult time."</p>
<p>But remaining workers are still expected to "fulfil their responsibilities" according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.es/la-desarrolladora-espanola-tequila-works-declara-bancarrota">sources Eurogamer.es spoke to</a> (translated via Google). I'm not sure what responsibilities really matter under these conditions, especially when the studio concedes they may not be in a position to pay the salaries of those workers. But that's the line management seem to be putting out.</p>
<p>The layoffs last month saw the axing of "a small number of roles" the studio said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/?originalSubdomain=es">post on LinkedIn</a>, which also announced the cancellation of that unannounced game. They noted it was "an incredibly difficult time" at the studio. In 2022 Tencent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-buy-majority-stake-in-rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers">became a majority shareholder</a> of the company, which was welcomed by studio management at the time. But in this instance, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">corporate consolidation</a> has not helped the studio in the long term.

</p><p>Aside from the human cost of all this, it means a studio who made some great games will now likely soon be dust. "I've had such a splendid time with Rime," said John (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-review">our review</a>, "[and] so deeply enjoyed its expansive and sumptuous world." And Alice B (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-the-sexy-brutale">once called</a> The Sexy Brutale "a very clever interlocking thing of beauty". </p>
