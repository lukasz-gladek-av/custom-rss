            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and InZoi publishers Krafton have launched a voluntary redundancy program in what appears to be a bid to shed ballast and winnow out unbelievers as they reorganise around the usage of generative AI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319">Business Korea</a> and passed along by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">Automation Media</a>, the redundancy program follows a quarter of record profits. Krafton will dole out severance packages in tiers, with people who've been there one year or less getting six months salary, while those who've been there for over 11 years get 36 months.</p>
<p>According to a company spokesperson, "the core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation."</p>
<p>Krafton <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company">announced plans to refocus on generative AI for game development</a> in late October. These refocussings include splurging $20.8 million / 30 million Korean won on retraining the workforce to use generative AI tools, while implementing some kind of automated management system.</p><p>They're also going to spend $69.7 million/100 billion won on a new GPU cluster - that is, a frosty warehouse full of computers with phat graphics cards that pool their might to complete difficult tasks, like patterning a dataset to produce a mean Piña Colada recipe without exhorting the end user to drink sawdust.</p>
<p>Krafton have also announced a hiring freeze across all roles save for those related to developing new intellectual properties or doing things with fancy chatbots, as detailed by CFO Bae Dong-geun in an earnings call on 4th November. The emphasis will be on individual staff being more productive, instead. </p>
<p>"Excluding organizations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel, we have frozen hiring company-wide," Dong-geun said, adding that "rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level, so we are stopping hiring for now, and we will organize and disclose later whether there will be changes to the five-year franchise IP strategy announced earlier this year."</p>
<p>This week, Epic's Tim Sweeney gave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">an "optimistic" defence of generative AI</a> in response to Eurogamer's unimpressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> review, arguing that "when tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people." It sort of feels like Krafton timed these announcements to wind him up.</p><p>Generative AI aside, Krafton are slap-bang in the middle of a legal war with ousted Unknown Worlds founders over the quality and release timing of Subnautica 2. I think Brendy and I have basically written a whole book on the subject by now. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">the last news article we wrote</a>, in which Unknown Worlds accuse their old bosses of leaking things to the press.</p>

            <p>Ah, it's gotten a bit worse. Bethesda are planning to release two patches to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> in order to rectify issues with its anniversary edition, meaning that the potential's there for more havoc to be played with mods. Though, outside of fixes for issues with the revamped Creations menu, it looks like a lot of the contents of these patches may end up being console-specific fixes, so there's a chance any extra PC disruption's relatively minimal.</p>
<p>I'd certainly hope it's less of a palaver than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-script-extender-has-already-gotten-its-anniversary-update-as-bethesda-battle-creation-issues">update's initial arrival</a>, which many modders have been quick to get on top of and push updates for their works.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re actively investigating issues you’re encountering with the latest Fallout 4 update and Anniversary Edition launch," the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/617683464289779908?l=english">Steam post</a> from Bethesda reads. "You should now see faster load times of the Creations menu, game menu, and redemption of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creation-club">Creation Club</a> items."</p>
<p>There's a hotfix coming to the game early next week, which the studio say will put the "issue causing creations that rely on DLC to not work" to bed, as well as a couple of problems specific to Xboxers and PlayStationeers. That ain't it, though. The hotfix'll be followed by two patches, the first arriving the week of November 24th, and the second being more loosely timetabled to rock up in the first half of December.</p><p>Bethesda haven't specified what'll be in either patch yet, with the exception of a boost to local Creations storage on Xbox. Maybe there'll only be one or two tweaks for us PC folk, but the studio not delineating these further patches as console-only suggests there'll at least be something PC-related in 'em. Here's hoping any tweaks are minimal, but even then, such is the nature of game updates that it can only take one bit of code moving or changing to throw a mod out of whack.</p>
<p>So, maybe leave any uber-modded returns to early next year if you want to play it safe in terms of avoiding any headaches.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The final episode of swish and salacious Telltale-style caped tellydrama Dispatch released yesterday. It's been a surprise hit - according to the gabbling labcoats at GameDiscoverCo, AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy is approaching two million sales. Reasons given for this range from the appealing but uninvestigated - there's a Galactus-sized untapped audience for narrative single player games, and all the publishers are absolute spanners for doubling down on live service projects instead - to the boring - people are still keen on superheroes, especially sociopathic and disgusting superheroes that cut against archetypes from the more pompous Marvel films, and Dispatch is simply <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/telltale-and-the-boys-make-mostly-beautiful-love-in-dispatch-a-slick-and-surprisingly-tactical-superhero-comedy">a very well-made game</a>. </p>
<p>Good games sell? What a <em>gauche</em>, back-of-napkin excuse for industry analysis. There must be a more arcane and clever-sounding explanation for Dispatch's meteoric fortunes. Ah yes, here we go: speaking to GameDiscoverCo, AdHoc's CEO and exec producer Michael Choung has suggested that it's partly down to the weekly episodic release schedule.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We're really just borrowing a rhythm that's worked for decades on television," he <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/how-did-narrative-hit-dispatch-hit">told the site</a>. "That weekly cadence hits a sweet spot where anticipation builds, but not long enough to fade." That's it. That's the whole quote. Still, it has given me Thoughts. </p>
<p>One is that I can now no longer tolerate the thought of episodic schedules at all. After years of streaming TV platforms, I am now only capable of watching shows all in one go, while crying into bowls of lukewarm salsa. The thought of getting to episode 5 and having to wait multiple diurnal cycles for episode 6 is a source of torment. Anything could happen between episodes! I might start watching something else instead! A piano might fall on me! I might be forced to spend time with my own thoughts! A month between episodes? You might as well ship it after our sun goes supernova.</p><p>Another more developed thought is that I want to go back and compare the formal structure of episodic narrative artworks, from Star Trek to Telltale's Walking Dead games, thinking about how the release tempo affects, for example, the writing of relationships and the choice and structure of cliffhangers. Monthly episodes surely need to be more like standalone releases; within that, what kinds of narrative event are best for nurturing suspense and speculation over a 30 day interval? If I dangle the prospect of killing off a major character, is that a better fit for a weekly rollout? Sorry, these are questions of craft TV writers have been writing books about for decades.</p>
<p>A third thought is that all of this is a far cry from the Telltale days of multiple-month gaps between episodes. Episode 1 of The Walking Dead: Season 2 came out in December 2013. Episode 2 came out in March 2014. Incredible! Just imagine how many pianos could fall on you in three whole months. Telltale was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-telltale-games">notoriously mismanaged</a>, with parallel, staggered projects and changes of direction creating a culture of crunch; I'm not sure how much that dictated the longer gaps between episodes, but the studio was clearly operating at the brink of capacity, for a lot of the time.</p>
<p>A fourth thought is simply that I need to go back and finish Dispatch. I reviewed the first couple of episodes, but then a week went by in which I stumbled upon new anime series Sanda and decided to rewatch Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun (no high velocity piano encounters, at least). Still, I can just about remember enough of episodes 1 and 2 to grasp the stakes going into episode 3. IIRC, there are two romance interests, both Problematic, and a man with flammable BO wants to kick my head in.</p>

            <p>Start setting up tripwires and stretch your bow strings, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> MMORPG dubbed Horizon Steel Frontiers has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ncsofts-project-skyline-rumoured-to-be-horizon-mmo-in-the-works-for-pc-and-unreal-engine-5">fully revealed</a> by Sony and developers NCSoft. As ever, it's all about slapping up and taming big metal bears, birds and the like, this time as a custom character in a world filled with other players who're also in the robo-hunting business.</p>

<p>As Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek says in the reveal video above, Steel Frontiers has been "built specifically for mobile" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publishers NCSoft, but is also coming to PC via the South Korean studio's launcher <a href="https://purple.plaync.com/download">Purple</a>.</p>
<p>Set in a region dubbed The Deadlands inspired by Arizona and New Mexico, the game'll see your custom Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram "sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, sometimes competing with rival tribes, or fighting over resources". Sounds quite Monster Huntery, as you'd expect.</p><p>Executive producer Sung-Gu Lee says giving massive machine hunts the MMO treatment's been the key focus for Steel Frontiers. "We’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines," he explains. "For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount and use them in subsequent fights. At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values: cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide."</p><p>

The footage shown off thus far looks pretty graphically swanky regardless of the stated mobile-first focus, and contains a lot more big swords than I remember from my time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Zero Dawn</a>. To be fair, I did spend 90% of that whacking things to death with Aloy's spear in a fashion I imagine led the game to sigh deeply while it gazed at the array of ranged weapons and gizmos I could be using if I didn't want to be flung at the scenery whenever I failed to dodge point blank swipes fast enough.

</p><p>Speaking of Aloy, she's nowhere to be seen in the video, so we'll have to see how or if the game works in any references to the metal-named huntress. As of right now, Steel Frontiers also doesn't have a release date. Alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-fire-arrows-alleging-nonsense-and-deliberate-corporate-water-muddying-at-tencent-as-horizon-lawsuit-rumbles-on-2">yelling at Tencent in court</a>, Sony and Guerilla have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guerrilla-confirm-their-rumoured-online-horizon-game-is-indeed-real">previously confirmed</a> they've got a new mainline Horizon entry in the works, as well as an online Horizon game of their own.</p>

            <p>Hello. My name is Julian Benson and, as you will have gathered from the headline, I am the new Editorial Director of Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this is my announcement post, in truth, I've already been here a couple of weeks. However, I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself as I worked through the treehouse, mapping out its dimensions on gridpaper.* I have had some successes in puzzling out the workings of this ancient structure – for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-only-more-games-ended-like-hardspace-shipbreaker">finding out how articles are posted</a>. Though, there are many rooms still to uncover, so I may remain in the background a little as I get situated. The bashing of furniture and snarls coming from behind the door marked  'Comment Moderation' suggest I should leave that one till last. But I did want to put my head above the treehouse's parapet – the crenellations are an architectural nod to its earlier days as RPS Towers and Castle RPS – and let you know who I am and why I'm here.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, when I was still working as a volunteer for long-departed gaming site Beefjack (alongside James, coincidentally), I reached out to Jim to pitch an article about transcribing games into musical notation. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/music-to-my-thumbs-transcribing-braid">The resulting article</a> was more ambitious than my writing ability could sustain, but I'll never forget the depth with which RPS's commenters engaged with and challenged my ideas. In all the years since, it was a level of discussion I've rarely seen at the other sites I've written for. Still, it would be more than a decade before I could return to RPS's pages outside of the Sunday Papers.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I've worked for sites such as TechRadar Gaming, GAMINGbible, and Kotaku UK, as well as RPS's other other fanzine, PCGamesN. It was only when I returned to freelance in 2023, appearing in Edge, The Guardian, and GQ, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/julian-benson">I could once again write on RPS</a>. Even a decade later, it still carries the thrill of that first feature.</p><p>As long as I've been writing about videogames I've been reading RPS, and there is no publication that has had a greater impact on how I talk about games and see their role in our lives. Part of the magic of this site is that it is a place where writers and readers will afford a game equal attention, whether it was made by a single developer or built by thousands. It is a magic conjured by a team of passionate writers, and equally passionate readers, who care about games and how they fit into culture – which is to say, alongside other artforms, neither above nor below them. So when the opportunity to join the team arose, I seized it.</p>
<p>That RPS is a space where this discussion can take place is only because of the hard work of the many members of the team who came before, a line stretching back to the site’s founders. Though I want to acknowledge in particular the size of the shoes Graham has left behind. Each of his boots are big enough to comfortably fit a Clarks outlet in the toe and a Doc Martens warehouse in the heel. Over 12 years, he and the team established and maintained the direction and voice of RPS, making it into the place I have the opportunity to lead today. The footsteps he and the others left are clear and I'm going to try my best to follow them and keep them in sight whenever we strike out into the new.</p>
<p>In the months since Graham's departure, the team has done an excellent job of running RPS. Selfishly, their capability makes my job of proving I can be of some use much harder. Now that I'm here I can't wait to lend a hand wherever I can.</p>
<p>I find the title of 'Editorial Director' to be uncomfortably grand, but it does capture my responsibility: I will be working hard to support this talented team do their best work, and for you, the readers, I will be the point of contact when you want to discuss the direction of the site. I'm not on social media but you can email me or reach out through the comments whenever you need.</p><p>To give you a sense of our current plans, at the moment we are hard at work putting together all the pieces that will see out the end of 2025: Advent Calendars, Selection Boxes, and larger pieces, such as this year's RPS 100, which has seen some significant upsets in the voting since last year's edition – my love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> will not be denied. And we will also be asking for your opinion, too, with a return of the RPS 100: Reader's Edition, which we plan to run through December.</p>
<p>We will have other announcements to make in 2026, I just need to find a way to get Graham's massive shoes out of my office so I can reach the desk…</p>
<p>So for now, I will say 'Hello! I am thrilled to be here'.</p>
<p>*I also used the time honing my Horace-drawing abilities. You can tell me if that time was spent fruitfully.</p>
