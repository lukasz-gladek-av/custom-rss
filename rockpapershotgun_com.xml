            <p>Playground Games offered the first in-depth look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, in addition to confirming its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-might-have-raced-onto-the-streets-faster-than-planned-thanks-to-an-ad">leaked release date of May 19th</a>. As you'd expect, there were lots of cars sliding and speeding through a variety of Japanese biomes in a manner I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marks-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">can't wait to experience for myself</a>, but one new feature introduced left me wondering whether it's something I'll actually take time out of my driving around for.</p>

<p>This feature's dubbed The Estate, and it's a big barren bit of land designed to let you build whatever sort of settlement/hangout you like. The concept seems quite like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the face of it, with this patch of rundown rural property mirroring Tomiko's Homestead as a sprawling home base you can wander back to if you fancy a break from driving around.</p>
<p>According to Playground design director Torben Ellert, The Estate comprises an entire mountain valley, which "starts off completely empty and overgrown, but once you unlock it, you can build and decorate directly in the open world here. And anything you construct is permanent and visitable by your friends." An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire post</a> offers a bit more detail, with this space being designed to mirror abandoned bits of rural property referred to in Japan as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Akiya/">Akiya</a>. "Being responsible for an Akiya is really rooted in community, you take on the job of refurbishing somewhere that’s useful and meaningful to the people around you," Ellert added in that post.</p><p>So, you can serve the community by building a giant private racetrack for you and your mates to lap, or designing some cross between a car dealership and a Bond villain's lair. I'll likely opt for a mix of both if I can be bothered, but honestly I can't say this is ever something I've yearned for a Horizon to have. The various purchasable player homes around the map have always done the trick whenever I've felt the need to stop and scroll through my garage or install some upgrades. There are still eight of those in Horizon 6, and each boast their own visually customisable garage space for the first time.</p>
<p>So, on the outside you've got a building handcrafted by the devs to fit aesthetically into the space in Horizon's Japanese landscape which it occupies, plus an interior space you can personalise without having to worry about potentially ending up thinking a bit of the map looks a tad more generic or artificial than the rest whenever you drive past it. In my eyes, that's the best of both worlds, and the garage customisation on its own is certainly a new addition I dig. The world also has permanent car meets you can head along to if you want a space to show off your exotic ride to other players.</p>
<p>Going back to The Estate, I could envision myself being more on board with using it as a base if Horizon 6's player homes had been left a bit more akin to Shadows' Kakuregas - purposefully small and customisation-free pit-stops designed to let you quickly take a break or replenish your stuff before you get right back on the road. As is, I'm left wondering if I'll end up looking at the empty section of Horizon 6's otherwise strenuously crafted map as a gap I'd have preferred Playground to fill in themselves.</p>

            <p>The surprise game reveal at last night’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fables-evil-landlords-wont-grow-devil-horns-as-reboot-ditches-classic-character-morphing-due-to-a-lack-of-belief-in-objective-arseholery">Xbox Developer Direct</a> was Kiln, a pottery-based multiplayer party brawler in the works at Double Fine. Combatants take the form of pots, vases, dishes, and urns, custom-sculpted and fired by players themselves, and will usually end up smashed into shards of tragic ceramic in the following online slapfights. Or maybe not, as there’s apparently nothing stopping you from simply playing Kiln as a nonviolent pottery sim by sticking to its clay-shaping component alone.</p>
<p>"The whole pottery part is such that it grabs people who might not want to jump into a multiplayer game," project lead Derek Brand explained to Microsoft’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>. "Some people just want to try pot making."</p> <figure>

<p>Judging from the reveal trailer, there is something enticingly simple about Kiln’s brown goop manipulation. I’ve only tried the real thing once and ended up with a crap bowl, but the two-button pulling and squeezing system that Kiln brings to the spinny table is clearly designed to make crafting finer vessels much easier. Regardless of whether or not you’re being canoodled by Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p>Sponges and scrapers are on hand for adding texture, and there’s also a selection of handles, glazes, and decorative patterns to adorn your pots with. Offbrand Le Creuset or offbrand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">Iron Fist Alexander</a>? That’s up to you.</p>
<p>Brand did add that Kiln will at least try to tempt pacifist potters into the game’s fighty side, saying "...if we can, we just slowly ease them into the 'I want to punch something now with this pot.' We don’t want it to be a hard shift from those two things." Those who heed the call will join objective-led punchups where the design of their pots affects how they perform on the battlefield: tall vases, for instance, can carry more water (useful for the 4v4 'Quench' mode where the aim is to douse the enemy team’s oven) but move slower and, because of their height, are less stable when they move.</p>

<p>Small plates, meanwhile, lack carrying capacity, but can unleash a special attack in which they bounce between enemies, chipping into them with sharp-edged rims. There are 24 of these moves in total, each dependent on a finished pot’s shape, and applying varying degrees of logic: sculpting a versatile mid-sized pot lets it shower enemies in a harmful rain of popcorn.</p>
<p>Yeah, I dunno. Do I have to put my pots in such mortal danger? I think I’d like my pots. Let my pots be, Kiln.</p>
<p>It’s out sometime in Spring 2026, PC and Game Pass included, and <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/sign-up-for-the-kiln-beta">beta playtest signups are open now</a>. Dedicated Double Fine followers may already be familiar with Kiln’s general homeware warfare angle, as it appeared as a prototype during the company’s Amnesia Fortnight game jam – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd7riA8vb8h1kP3jCFS_qtTM">broadcast on YouTube</a> – all the way back in 2017. It’s evidently struck a more colourful, jolly tone than that of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVJCxk5VDvA">original pitch</a>, though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doublefine.com/post/3md2bsg7k6k2u">Double Fine’s Bluesky account</a> says it’s stayed free of generative AI in the intervening years.</p>
