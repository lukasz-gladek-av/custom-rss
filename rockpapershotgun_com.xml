            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell remake</a> has a new director who's served as its director before. David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft and take up the role he left when he departed the company in 2022, not long after being tapped as the remake's original director following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-have-stealth-announced-a-splinter-cell-remake">late 2021 announcement</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake," Grivel revealed in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU">LinkedIn post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/">GamesRadar</a>. "A very special team and project to me."</p>
<p>Grivel's return to the project follows a few years in which he's worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">now-shuttered studio Ridgeline Games</a>, briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto to work on the early stages of an unannounced project, then left to join NetEase-backed studio Worlds Untold. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">Worlds Untold then shut its doors</a> as he was transitioning into has job there, which sounds like a particularly horrible scenario to have faced.</p>
<p>With that road walked, the developer's now back at Ubi Toronto again, having spent 11 years there in the initial stint that ended with his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985690674448793600/">2022 departure</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> remake. During that time, he worked as a game designer on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, Primal, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>.</p><p>If you're wondering whether Grivel's return will see Ubisoft actually pull the covers off the Splinter Cell remake or provide an update as it how its development's going, the answer seems to be a no, at least for now. Things have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">very quiet on the game's front</a> since that initial 2021 reveal, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">potential teases</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-is-now-on-steam-but-youll-have-to-deal-with-some-ubisoft-faffage">Steam arrival of Pandora Tomorrow</a> having whipped up hopes. This arguably isn't out of character for a stealty sneakfest, but has left folks keen to splinter their cells without much of an idea how things are shaping up.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that with Grivel now back on board, we might at least get a brief morse code message about the state of the remake sometime soon. Otherwise, it'll be more gazing at Ubisoft from afar through tactical goggles, waiting to see if they pull the trigger on releasing the thing.</p>

It is an incredibly difficult thing to sell someone on a game in just one sentence. What are you meant to focus on, genre, specific mechanics, an interesting element of the story? There's not a right answer! I'm not going to figure out a recipe for success right here and now, but what I can do is at least show you a single sentence that sold me on a game called Burden Street Station quite quickly: "A surreal, narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game where you shapeshift during conversations to uncover how God went missing."
</p>
<p>
A stunner of a line! The concept of God going missing and the implication that it is your responsibility to figure it out says a tremendous amount in a few words. I know the genre, a narrative adventure game, and there is even a hint towards mechanics, the shapeshifting element. Personally, that's all I need to be convinced, but we'll dig deeper all the same.

A surreal game where you mostly help all sorts of freaks come to terms with the fact that god no longer exists.
and you'll get to know more about it it very, very soon.

DEMO COMING TO STEAM TOMORROW. WE WILL BE WAITING.

In the world of Burden Street Station, moments from the lives of mortals, be they good or bad, are taken and turned into sentient books, which in turn get sold to Gods for the same reason you and I read books, entertainment. Except in your particular world, the production of these books stops in its tracks, and its God vanishes. So you, alongside one of those sentient books, must talk to the people of this world to figure out what the hell went down.
</p><p>
There's an apparent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> influence here, and an overall '90s PC adventures game vibe, alongside more modern series like ENA. Mechanically, you can change different parts of your body throughout your conversations with mortals to produce different dialogue options, some of which look suitably irreverent and sarcastic, the epitome of '90s conversations.
</p>
<p>
Apparently a demo for it will be available tomorrow, December 2nd, so let's all agree to log on to Steam and give it a go, yeah? Or at least wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126340/Burden_Street_Station/">here</a> in the meantime.
