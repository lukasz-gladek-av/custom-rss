            <p>
Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> hotfix, this one being number 34, or version 4.1.1.6931813 of the game if you really want to be specific. There's a number of fixes we'll get to in a minute, but first the thing you're probably most excited to hear: it has a native Steam Deck build now! Developer Larian Studios shared word of this change in a Steam news post today, and what exactly it means for you.
</p>
<p>
The big things you should now notice while playing on Steam Deck is that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has a more stable framerate, that loading times won't be quite as long, and just generally smoother gameplay. As explained in the news post, this hotfix has made some changes to how game models are streamed in, meaning across all platforms areas like the Lower City in Act 3 that are known for their framerate spikes will work better too.
</p>
<p>
In turns of the big difference between the previous version of Baldur's Gate 3 and this one for Steam Deck users, before it was a Proton version that ran on the Steam Deck via a Proton compatibility layer. This meant it was more intensive on the handheld's CPU, but now that it runs natively it'll need less CPU usage and memory consumption overall!"
</p>
<p>
There's some details on where to find your saves in both versions of the game, and if you use Steam Cloud saves, you'll find your saves post-update anyway. As long as you're logged into your Larian account, all mods you're subscribed to should be downloaded when the game transitions into the native build.
</p><p>
Now, some of the other more general fixes! On the gameplay side, the Hound of Ill Omen and the Accursed Spectre's HP will no longer be affected by difficulty modifiers for enemy characters. An annoying bug that caused the Apostle of Myrkul to gain HP every time you would load a save mid-combat in Tactician and Honour Mode has also been fixed.
</p>
<p>
There are a bunch of audio fixes in this one too, like an issue where it sounded like smokepowder explosions going off on the floor above on the ground floor of Felogyr's Fireworks would send like they're happening next to you instead.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps my favourite fix is in the cinematics section, which simply reads, "Told one of the imps on the nautiloid to stop looking in the wrong direction." You tell 'em, patch notes writer. You can read the full list of patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278">here</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a> is a bit of an alarming game to look at. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game is so clearly an anime-esque riff on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a>, with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a> style web swinging thrown in for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. All of that's been obviously more or less since its announcement. But the game just received its first gameplay trailer at Tokyo Game Show, and it looks scarilyâ€¦ expensive.
</p>
<p>
Through the roughly seven minutes of gameplay, set to a song I can only describe as "song you let play on the radio while driving just because you want to fill the silence," more and more Things just kept happening. One minute the main character is driving a motorbike, the next they're taking a selfie through different scenes, one of which shows a mostly naked man escaping police on a robotic, walking toilet, and then the next they're fighting goons Yakuza-style in the street.
</p>

<p>
And more things keep happening after that! There's the aforementioned Spider-Man swinging, a giant city-destroying robot, and just so many fictitious shops with such well realised branding you could convince me I could actually visit them. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't even mentioning the fact that Ananta just wholesale rips off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s character transition, letting you hop into another, presumably gacha rolled, character's body, continuing on whatever they're doing. There's even quite an interesting use of this where you can do so while you're being held at gunpoint, with the switch to another character allowing you to snipe enemies from afar.
</p><p>
It really has that GTA ethos of "you can do everything," an ethos I don't necessarily feel great about considering the amount of labour likely required to achieve it, which raises questions of how ethical that labour was achieved. There's a chance it's teetering on the edge of having too much to do the do, to the point it becomes overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Ananta isn't just alarming because of how much of an "everything" game it presents itself as, but because I have some reservations about its narrative framing. The main character is the new captain of a special task force, essentially what seems to be the police. There's even a moment about halfway through where, as a different character, you can just handcuff and arrest an NPC.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can have games where you play as the police, there are good and interesting stories about police too, but I can't help but feel a bit concerned by such a, potentially small, gameplay feature. There's no amount of cute half-animal anime women that can make it easy to breeze past such a thing.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a game to be curious but cautious about, whenever it comes out.
