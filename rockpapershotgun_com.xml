Do you ever think to yourself, "gee, I wish that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">LA Noire</a> actually looked like a noir film and also everyone is a furry"? Then boy howdy do I have the game for you: The Shadow Syndicate. It just got announced yesterday at the Gamescom Latam showcase, and I should say it's not exactly like LA Noire in that you don't have to try and read the faces of motion capture actors overperforming their hearts out. What it does have is some detective work, gunplay, and even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payneish</a> bullet-time. How can you not be into that mixture?
</p>

<p>
The game is set in an early 1930s Brooklyn, and you play as private detective Sam Marlowe. According to a press release, Sam's mentor has gone missing, and alongside that there's a weird secret group getting up to no good.

I would like to point out there is also essentially zero mention of the fact that everyone is an anthropomorphic animal anywhere in said press release, the only mention it gets is "evocative character designs", which they certainly are. I'm into it though, this is a hard-boildish Noir we're talking about, everyone being a dog or a chicken is just the way of the world, don't think about it too hard.
</p>
<p>
There's two parts to the gameplay, one being the aforementioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gunplay, which does seem to borrow from Max Payne's iconic mechanic. The other is talking to citizens to collect clues, as well as interacting with the city at large, all of which gets jotted down in Sam's journal to help open up new dialogue options and story paths.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, The Shadow Syndicate doesn't have an exact release date just yet. It's due out some time in 2026 at the very least, and in the meantime, you can always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a "brand new Honkai game", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Kiana isn't from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Star Rail</a>, she's from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-impact">Impact 3rd</a>, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="547"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1kdsy74/new_honkai_game_announced/">New Honkai Game announced</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable-Feedback11/">u/Vegetable-Feedback11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/">HonkaiStarRail</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow.
</p>
<p>
There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account <a href="https://x.com/StarRailVerse1/status/1915725508639179139">Star Rail Universe</a> found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hoyoverse-stardew-valley-style-game-astaweave-haven-wechat-account-potential-announcement-soon">game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley</a>. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.
