            <p>CD Projekt have rolled out a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch with fixes and tweaks for some of update 2.3's additions. The most noteworthy is what sounds like a pretty hefty revamp of how the autodrive function goes about conveying your ride from A to B.</p>
<p>If you missed it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">arriving back in July</a>, update 2.3 was the final set of new stuff CD Projekt plan to add to the first Cyberpunk, a game they've been physically unable to stop themselves from delving back into over the past couple of years, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">Cyberpunk 2 having been in the works for a little while now</a>. To be fair, most of its contents were vehicle and photo mode-related, with the autodrive function and similar Delamain taxi system heaflining alongside some new rides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you might guess from this <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51794/patch-2-31">patch 2.31's notes</a>, autodrive's a feature that's come with a few kinks for anyone who's tried it. I've been able to rely pretty well on it to get me where I want to go in the on-and-off Cyberpunk playthrough I've had going for about a month now, but it has suffered from constantly jamming the brakes on in a very jarring fashion, as well as occasionally getting stuck or rear ending some poor fellow in a tiny Makigai MaiMai.</p>
<p>The devs have clearly been at work on those hangups, writing that as of this patch: "When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably." Sounds great, assuming other traffic have been se to automatically give way at junctions, otherwise there'll be a rise in Kiroshi dashcam footage of Thortons being t-boned in the near future.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Patch 2.31 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Mac and Nintendo Switch 2!</p><p>This update includes an AutoDrive upgrade and Photo Mode adjustments. It also addresses common issues encountered by players. For details, check the full list of… <a href="https://t.co/Jdpx1DI4V5">pic.twitter.com/Jdpx1DI4V5</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1966081108199809196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Aside from that, there are some fixes for the quests surrounding update 2.3 vehicles like the Semimaru and Muramasa, as well as on that saw Johnny Silverhand always spawn in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cabs. He's always been in back for me, so I must have gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Moving to photo mode, CD Projekt have made "most" of the character poses added update 2.3 work with folks of any gender and disabled NPC collision in the mode. That collision removal's in an effort to "make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision", such as perching Rogue or Kerry on the bonnet of your car.</p>
<p>The last couple of bits I'll highlight are PC-specific fixes. One's for "an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink", which is an equally hilarious and horrifying hardware happening. The second's for path tracing not activating properly in "certain scenarios".</p>
<p>Obviously, patches are the enemy of load orders, so it's worth checking or waiting for mod updates if you don't fancy disabling the likes of this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies">story-driven rent system</a> if you've got them installed. Don't want the landlord selfies being borked next time you chip in, you know?</p>

            <p>Watch out! EA claim to have created "the most dangerous ring in gaming" for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale, and they won't stop waving their lethal hoop around in a post that runs down the mode's features ahead of its first Labs playtest.</p>
<p>Prior to now, all we've gotten battle royale-wise have been teases, with the devs busy seeking feedback on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s more standard multiplayer bits during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">recent open beta</a>. Oh, and showing off their campaign's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">rampant helicopter destruction</a>, lest we forget the great sacrifice of those poor metal birds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing">blog post</a>, EA insist their battle royale'll still be plenty Battlefieldy, since it doesn't ditch the gadgets, explosives, environmental destruction, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/better-for-battlefield-6-vehicles-to-start-off-too-weak-says-producer-to-players-sore-about-tooled-up-engineers">vehicles</a> you usually have at your disposal in field battles. There'll be 100 players crammed into a specially built new map, armed with "two default gadgets" their chosen class to kick off the hunting for loot and experience points. Oh, and obviously the killing, can't forget about that.</p>
<p>Enveloping this gaggle is the usual battle royale contracting boundary, but EA claim to not have settled for any old harmful circle, as they outline below:</p>
<blockquote>We set out to bring the most dangerous ring in gaming to Battle Royale that instantly kills players upon contact. With urgent warnings as the fire approaches, soldiers will be pushed into more intense firefights as the game space continues to shrink. There’s no jumping in and out of it, no using it for cover, no walking through it - if you get caught in it, you are done. We’re excited to see how the ring affects the pace of the game and how it creates spontaneous showdowns.</blockquote>
<p>Jiminy crickets, a brim of bad times so deadly you've got to describe it like an obstacle from the classic children's tale We're Going on a Bear Hunt. I like the idea of instant murder over a countdown or gradual damage in theory, though that'll probably go out of the window the moment I'm a bit too slow to migrate towards the middle of the map melee.</p><p>Another detail worth noting is the makeup of the goodies players'll be able to grab during these fights. "There are five tiers of weapons to loot along with attachments, throwables (Ex. Frag Grenades), gadgets (Ex. RPGs), Strike Packages (Ex. Air Strike), armor, upgrade kits, and custom drops of favorited weapons," EA outline. The mode also packs support class revives and "mobile redeploy options" that can bring you back if you snuff it because you've been blasted into oblivion while trying to snag your most beloved of bullet-dealers.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> contains what could be a cheeky reference to this year's prior headline success story from a smaller developer, Sandfall Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Are you playing Team Cherry's new metroidvania? Here's how to find that Easter egg. Beware mild area and equipment spoilers from this point on.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Briefly, you'll need to head west of Wormways and play your needolin at the nearby Weavenest Karn. Alas, you might need to cough up 500 rosaries for a Simple Key in order to access the place, if you haven't already. The needolin, for context, is a musical instrument that sometimes reveals apparitions and other ghostly activity, when plucked in the right area - read our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong walkthrough</a> hub for more. In this case, Hornet's lonely ditty will trigger some phantom text about sleep and entrapment, which includes the phrase "for those who come after".
</p>
<p>
We first <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q1cQyr5">learned of this</a> from Reddit, spawning ground for any and all videogame Easter egg reports and also, any number of fakes. Our James then dug out his savegame from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> and confirmed that the sequence is real.
</p>
<p>
"For those who come after" is the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWate4IdV7M">a beloved orchestral track from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. It's a key phrase in the game's story, uttered by characters laying down their lives in the quest to stop the Paintress. It's also, of course, a fairly everyday bit of writing, the kind of line that adorns many a memorial work, and the reference could be accidental. But the shared musical context inclines me to believe that Team Cherry intended the connection.
</p><p>
I do hope it's intentional. I love this kind of embedded compliment. It reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> devs wrote a whole in-game skit about hairdryers to express their fondness for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/alien-isolation-preview">Cara Ellison's Guardian preview</a>. (My equivalent for that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> devs derisively including my Eurogamer "Avoid" in their accolades trailer.)</p>
<p>I also very much like that the apparent link is revealed through music, as though Hornet's soulful string-plucking had flittered across the void of commerce and raised an echo from the art nouveau necropolis of Expedition 33. There you are, I've overegged the pudding now.
</p>
<p>
Sandfall Interactive appear fond of Silksong themselves - they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1ndhpxh/expedition_33_devs_celebrating_silksong/">posted some congratulatory art</a> featuring Hornet and Clair Obscur's Maelle. Let's see if the good vibes persist come GOTY voting time.
</p>
<p>Silksong's other secrets include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">a mystery cameo from Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-hollow-knight-silksong-does-have-another-difficulty-mode-just-not-the-one-you-probably-want">hidden mode that probably isn't the kind you're hoping for</a>. I think it's safe to say that there's much else to discover.</p>

            <p>There's another message about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s Coronations DLC for you to read, sire. Developers PDS Black have apologised for the update not being up to par, and issued the first of multiple patches aimed at rectifying its issues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, this add-on fleshes out ascending to the throne in the crown-heavy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game a bit more, as well as letting you set a key goal for your regime. It arrived earlier this week, and the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">quickly sank to mostly negative</a>. The main gripes were buggy oaths - you can swear oaths at the end of coronations, earning rewards if you fulfil your oath on time - and whether gating some relatively small-scale yet significant features behind paid DLC was justified.</p>
<p>Paradox have now responded to that backlash, with a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">statement penned by Riad</a>, a QA manager at Crusader Kings 3 developer PDS Black. Writing that the Coronations wasn't "up to the standard you deserve", the developer continued: "It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p>
<p>According to Riad, the upcoming All Under Heaven DLC, which'll expand the game's map into China, Japan and southeast Asia, has required the vast majority of the studio's attention and resources. As a result, the team working on the smaller Coronations had to get by with "limited resources" and less staff.</p><p>"As a studio, we’re taking a hard look at how we assign resources, and support our developers so that every release meets the expectations you rightfully have," the QA manager wrote. "For example, we will be more stringent about allowing last-minute changes to the game (which can cause issues like broken oaths). We will also ensure that we dedicate more time towards full-length playthroughs throughout the entire development cycle, to ensure that issues like these can’t slip through."</p>
<p>Riad added that it "hurts so much when we fuck up like this", and that the studio will be aiming to earn back the trust of players. That'll likely be a very tall order given that this is hardly a one-off for Paradox. The publishers have acquired a bit of a reputation for regularly releasing DLC which is either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-releasing-the-worst-reviewed-game-on-steam">low quality</a>, viewed as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">unnecessary extra monetisation</a>, or some combo of the two. The latter's been front and centre recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s paid DLC clans, a mess we're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">currently waiting to see the full extent of Paradox's cleanup plans</a> for. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you're ready to trust Paradox again, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> devs have quickly put out a patch aimed at fixing the main issues with Coronations' oaths. Riad also specified that there'll be "at least one more patch" for the DLC coming, "to fix many of the issues we encountered ahead of the release, but didn’t have enough time to fix". You can find the full notes for the first patch, which is out now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991?l=english">here</a>.</p>
