            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is set to finally emerge from early access in 2026, developers Pocketpair have announced. There's a lot of work the game about not-Pokémon, guns, and maunfacturing will need prior to that point, say the studio who've been busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">staring down Lionel Hutzes who probably know the DK rap off by heart.</a> They've also teased that a bunch of new additions are in the works for the 1.0 update. </p>

<p>"While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about Palworld 1.0," Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley said in the above video announcement. "Beyond just adding new content there’s a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access.</p>
<p>"It’s no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><p>As a result, the studio plans to be "a little quiet" for the rest of 2025, with the survival game's winter update not set to be as chunky as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518574472406499342">Feybreak or v0.4 update</a> it got last December. That said, Buckley did still indicate "a few surprises" are planned for that winter update.</p>
<p>The big tease-a-thon continued, with the community manager declaring that a "truly massive amount of content" is in the works for the 1.0 update that'll bring Palworld out of the early access cocoon it's occupied since January last year. "We plan to share some sneak peeks about Palworld 1.0 in the very near future," he concluded.</p>
<p>Amid releasing updates including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-palworld-update-adds-crossplay-photo-mode-new-drafting-table-feature-and-cosmetic-armour">crossplay</a> and a Terarria <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-palworlds-terraria-collab-now-out-in-the-wild-terraria-will-be-getting-its-own-palworld-crossover-eventually">collab</a> so far this year, Pocketpair have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">getting a publishing arm up and running</a>. Horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Dead Take</a> from Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU devs Surgent Studios and retro-handheld-inspired angler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611240/Normal_Fishing/">Normal Fishing</a> are among the titles the studio have helped release or signed up so far. All while Mario gives them the evils from a window across the road.

            <p><a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">The Crew Unlimited</a>, a fan project making Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, released yesterday, September 15th. There's been some early issues to rectify, with the developers having put out two hotfixes already and emphasised that they're "not responsible" for any problems caused by people having grabbed "broken/corrupted game files" from "shady sources".</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">reported earlier this month</a>, The Crew Unlimited's devs started working on it not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play"> pulled the racer's official servers offline</a> in March 2024, rendering it unplayable. Cue a group of fans deciding to set up a server emulator that'd allow them to get it up and running again for players who still had the game files installed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon opening up its gullwing doors yesterday, the project quickly ran into some teething issues. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1107329778396172348/1417303193984962570">an announcement on Discord</a> early this morning, project lead whammy4 revealed that the team have performed "over 10 hours of non-stop tech support" out of the gate, and it looks like the majority of the issues have affected folks who didn't already legitmately own The Crew's game files via Steam prior to grabbing The Crew Unlimited.</p>
<p>"It has come to my attention that a lot of you have acquired (by whichever shady methods...) broken/corrupted game files," the developer wrote. "If you have acquired the game files from shady sources then we are not responsible for whether your game works or not. Players with legit Steam copies have had by far the least issues, no wonder. Also, to those who expect swift 24/7 around-the-clock support for them and them personally - I don't want to say rude things in announcements."</p><p>Prior to the project's release, its developers had acknowledged via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ page</a> that while they wouldn't be distributing any of The Crew's game files, "as long as you manage to run the game files, we have absolutely no way to tell a legit copy from a non-legit one, so we just have to let you in."</p>
<p>Around that announcement, the team have put out a number of fixes. The first, a launcher update called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417254654672113735">version 1.1.0.0</a>, fixed the default save "disappearing and preventing the game from logging you in", as well as some DateTime string errors. It also added an 'Apply' button to the cheats section in the hopes of averting some "interface confusion".</p>
<p>That update's been followed by two hotfixes. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417310879262965870">Version 1.1.1.0</a> stopes a default 'TCUPlayer' profile being automatically created and save game names being left blank, while <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417332986105430066">version 1.1.2.0</a> rectifies the player being automatically given the username, er, "UserName" instead of the default 'TCUPlayer' due to "a logic error in the launcher" if you clicked play straight away.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but my defining memory of The Crew is not being able to get the Artic Monkeys' 'Do I Wanna Know?' out of my head, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure I wanna know if it's as overplayed in this fan revival.</p>
