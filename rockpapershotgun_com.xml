            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">went live a short time ago</a> as I write this. While plenty of folks look to have gotten in already, its devs have issued some guidance for the many others who've reported running into error messages or having their downloads stick.</p>
<p>The team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme who've swiftly resurrected the Minecraft-esque sandbox after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights from Riot Games</a> had predicted launch day might see some teething troubles due to a bottleneck of eager Hytalers, and it certainly seems those concerns weren't misplaced.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While some of the errors folks have run into early doors trying to get into Hytale have been at the point of purchase - here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-error-a-basket-with-that-identifier-does-not-exist-fix">handy guide on how to deal with at least one of those</a> - a bunch of reported having things go pear-shaped while trying to download the game via its launcher.</p>
<p>Cue a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/523059903812599811/551337246364532737">Discord server</a> full of people spamming error messages. So far the Hypixel team are working on fixes, but the main bit of advice at this early stage is simple. "If you are seeing launcher downloads being stuck / error. Please restart the launcher," Hytale tech director Slikey has posted. "Global distribution is still rolling, so you may need to keep trying."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you are seeing really weird stuff, please reply to me.</p>— Slikey (@slikey) <a href="https://twitter.com/slikey/status/2011095876270203181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, folks with "really weird stuff " are being encouraged to reply to his tweet. While Hytale's Discord server doesn't appear to have a dedicated channel for those seeking help solving issues or getting advice on fixing bugs, its general game discussion channel has seen a bunch of posting to that effect in the past hour or so.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you're able, I'd give it an hour or two to settle down before trying to hop in if you're keen not to spend time having tech doors potentially slam in your face. Maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-doom-running-in-hytale-before-its-even-out-thanks-to-modders">watch a modder play Doom in Hytale</a> on repeat if that helps. We also have a guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">installing the latter on the Steam Deck</a> if you need such a thing.</p>

            <p>Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting bugs. Or so will say the folks who don the gear of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s next warbond. It's dubbed Redacted Regiment and it's all about looking stealthy in a tactical fashion. As opposed to simply trying to hide in a corner because you're a coward, as I've unashamedly done numerous times while serving Super Earth.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491587748125214428">next gear pack</a> for the shooter's set to arrive on January 20th, and marks the first proper new addition its gotten since the calendar flipped over in 2026. So, what sort of kit is it delivering in return for hard-earned super credits? Well, in two words, sneaky shit.</p>
<p>Both of its primary weapons - the R-72 Censor and AR-59 Suppressor - are rifles with integrated quietening tech. I mean the latter's literally named after said quietening tech, so you probably guessed that. The Censor's aimed at taking down targets at medium range, while the Suppressor has a longer reach. The armour sets which accompany these armaments are similarly sneaky. The RS-89 Shadow Paragon set's your standard light tactical infiltrator getup, complete with 15 million pockets, while the RS–67 Null Cipher set provides medium protection thanks to angular metal planting designed to ditch radar detection.</p><p>They come with a "Concealed Insertion" booster, which whacks up a smoke screen to emerge through when your hellpod touches down, completing the hushed hitman ensemble. Rounding things out are a sidearm in the P-35 Re-Educator pistol, which shoots dart that make enemies delirious. Then, there are a couple of explodey things in the form of a backpack full of C4 as a stratagem and a mine which lures foes to it before enboomening.</p>
<p>It all looks decently fun, but I'd say it's a bit too dry to mirror the wackier warbonds which I reckon are where Helldivers 2's slapstick shootery really shines. No <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">wormhole teleportation packs</a> to be seen here, though I suppose if every set of new gear had one, it wouldn't be as special.</p>
<p>Odds seem good that once this warbond's live, Arrowhead might start cracking into whatever regimen of new battle scenarios or galactic threats they have planned for the game's unending war this year. Things have been fairly quiet since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">Into the Unjust update</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">technical tweaks</a>, so it feels like Super Earth's finest are due having another big twist flung their way soon.</p>
