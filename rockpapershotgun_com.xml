Okay, now, I know you've probably read that headline and thought to yourself "why on earth would outdated UI in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> be a good thing?" Allow me to explain! To be a contrarian for a moment, I think that a large amount of triple-A games have incredibly boring UI. It's very much because of that late 2010s trend of simple, emboss-free graphic design you see in logo design everywhere these days, and I hate it.

Silent Hill f, however, as shown off during today's Konami Press Start showcase, looks to have UI that would fit right at home in a PS3 game. It's outdated, technically, but it looks like it's been built with a lot more thought. It's not even particularly complicated - there's a health bar, a stamina bar, some kind of… floral and crescent moon bars. There's a light ugliness about it that I think a lot of games on the PS3 also had, even games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, that I find a lot more appealing than the modern, clean aesthetic you'll see a lot of. Just compare the original Demon Souls and its remake, for example.

The showcase did also do a bit of a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's gameplay, which, as is typical of the series, looks like you'll be swinging around a metal pipe a lot. Game director Al Yang did say the team is hoping to make sure the combat system is "fresh, but familiar, yet also be thematically appropriate and not overly complex."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't tell you if they've done that or not, though it doesn't matter to me all that much. It's not like I come to the Silent Hill series for exciting mechanics, I'm in it for the vibes. And the vibes do look good! There were some brief looks at some concept art, and the team spoke of how they set the game in the Showar era to tap into customs and superstitions "long forgotten in modern life."
</p>
<p>
I'm certainly a lot more interested in Silent Hill f than I am the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remake of the first game that was also announced</a>. It's the first new entry in years (no I'm not counting Ascension), so if anything I'm morbidly curious as to whether or not the world can actually be expanded in such a way or not. Plus, again, I like how unclean the UI is! I'm a simple person, with simple needs.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f is due out September 25th, later this year.

I feel like every time I write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, I always have to add a caveat along the lines of, "I don't really like shooters… but!" There often is a but, because occasionally one of 'em rolls around that feels like it just gets me, you know? This week, it's a shooter that feels like it was born to be a Flash game on Newgrounds in the mid-2000s that you'll sometimes bring up to your friends saying "man, remember that one game?" It's called Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion, and as simple as its title is, there's a lot going for it.
</p>

<p>
For one, it's being made by Bubby Darkstar, the same developer behind 2021's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750570/Subway_Midnight/">Subway Midnight</a>, a game I'm always surprised by insofar that it doesn't have as far reaching an obsessive fan base as I thought it would get. Subway Midnight is already a visually surreal delight, but Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion really looks like it's amping up the balls to the walls zaniness factor. It apparently has over 200 NPCs to "interact and have terrible conversations with," all of which are hand-drawn, a kind of ridiculous feat for what I think might be a dev team of not much more than one.

You've also got more than 50 unique robots to take on, dozens of bosses, "a guy named 'Donnie' who's a real freak" and six levels to wade through. Gameplay wise it looks like your classic boomer shooter by way of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>, plenty of regular guns to find and use, alongside a few weirder ones. This thing just looks worth playing through if you're an animation lover alone, the colours are so vibrant and some of the designs on display feel like they were born to be turned into Twitter profile pictures (but like, when Twitter wasn't what it is now, when it was sometimes ok and not a constant hellfire).
</p>
<p>
The trailer also clearly points out that not a drop of generative AI was used to make it, a disclaimer that I wish didn't have to exist, but one I'm glad to see all the same. It's not too far away from release either - currently it's slated to be released next month, July 10th. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/?curator_clanid=4777282">here</a>.
