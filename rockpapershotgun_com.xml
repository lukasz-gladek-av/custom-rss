  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In May this year, despite being deep in development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>, CD Projekt revealed that they'd be whipping out one more patch for The Witcher 3 in honour of its tenth birthday. Said update was originally set to drop in 2025, but has now been pushed back into 2026.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of an extra wait for cross-platform mod support, and given what the studio have been like witch Cyberpunk 2077's seemingly never-ending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">string of last updates</a>, I'm not ruling out them having secretly decided to add more new stuff to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> masterpiece while they're at it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026," the studio announced in a tweet. "We apologise for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>While the update's arguably bigger news for console players who'll be getting access to Witcher 3 mods for the first time, as we saw with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heed-the-dark-urge-and-check-out-baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-which-adds-13-new-evil-endings-plus-official-mod-tools">built-in mod support</a>, having another way for us PC folks to mod up our games is never a bad thing. As in that case, this official Witcher modding support will be done via Mod.io, which might be a preferable route for some, especially for relative modding newbies.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026.</p><p>We apologize for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release.… <a href="https://t.co/klXCkudiz1">pic.twitter.com/klXCkudiz1</a></p></div>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1971240482941362445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Obviously sticking to established modding setups will still be an option on PC. Odds are a lot of the most popular works will end up on both Mod.io and Nexus Mods, with more advanced mods likely remaining PC exclusive due to the added restrictions console modding entails. PC'll also remain the sole place you can fire up the REDkit tools CD Projekt released a little while ago to create mods.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the full FAQ CD Projekt released alongside their initial announcement of the update a read or re-read, you can find it <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">here</a>. Otherwise, here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fancy-snooping-around-the-witcher-3-palace-from-blood-and-wine-well-this-mod-gives-it-a-book-accurate-interior">cool Witcher 3 mod</a> you can play right now.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is news. You can bet your bottom it was news to me when I loaded up Nexus Mods for my daily look this morning and found that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s adult section had tripled in size overnight. It's the sexy Hornet mods, they've broken containment, truth-telling hips and all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until today, my searches for story-worthy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> mods had returned only the benign, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in">boss practice</a> add-ons that you could comfortably show an elderly relative. No more. Last night saw a pair of sexy Hornet mods, the first to hit the Nexus to my knowledge, arrive.</p>
<p>Shot first was '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/427">Curvier Hornet</a>' from modder Sandinsoda. "It was bound to happen," they wrote, pointing would-be sexy Skongers to requirements <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/142">Silksong Customizer</a>. As you'd imagine, the mod makes the capeless version of Hornet you play as at one point in metroidvania a bit more, er, voluptuous in terms of figure.
</p>
<p>Mere hours later, the chaser, a second mod. This time, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=description">Curvy naked hornet</a>' by modder foureye5. Sandinsoda marched straight into its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=posts">comments section</a>, bellicosely bellowing "I wonder what prompted this". Tension ensued for several hours, only to be broken by a third party, who replied: "Honestly it looks different enough to warrant it being a serious alternative. Like this one has better thighs. But yours has a better chest."</p>
<p>"Fair enough," responded Sandinsoda.</p>
<p>That's the torrid tale of why if you pull up <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong/mods?showAdultContent=true">Silksong's Nexus Mods page</a> right now and filter so that only ones tagged adult show up, you'll find three things. These two mods - the nude Hornet equivalent of Beavis and Butthead - and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/383">another mod</a> that adds a swear to the text prompt for binding.</p><p>Are these curvy Hornet mods the first ever sexy Silksong works ever created? Almost certainly not, since it has a <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/255454-hollow-knight-silksong-nude-mods/">Loverslab page</a> I refuse to verify my age in order to access, because I still have some shreds of dignity left. However, they are the first to emerge into what I'd deem the modding mainstream. Unrepentant. Insolent. Aimed a target audience of jokesters and probably at least one serious craver of Skong sexuality. Took them long enough, given they've even been preceded by a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/283">makes Hornet disappear altogether</a>.</p>
<p>What times in which we live.</p>

            <p>I don't massively feel the need for a new version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a>, even following EA's posh remake of the first, but if you've been dreaming of another visit to the game's sprawling interstellar necropolis, you could do worse than to check out the community-brewed Marker Patch. 
</p>
<p>Primarily created by Wemino, whose other projects include tune-ups for bullet-time shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>, it's a cure-all bundle of fixes for various issues with the game's PC release, including problems created by running it at higher frame-rates on heavier-duty 10 core PCs. Vemino has also increased the max number of genuinely dead Necromorphs that can be present in the environment, forced anisotropic filtering throughout, and added options to stop the game automatically connecting to online services that are no longer offered by EA.
</p><!--more-->
<p>You can find the Marker patch on <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/MarkerPatch">Github</a>. It's compatible with both the Steam release and the EA app version, with instructions for getting it working on Steam Deck or Linux. Here is a compressed/curated rundown of the contents I have produced by running my Plasma Cutter crudely over the Github page:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Stabilizes physics behavior at high framerates to eliminate the annoying flying corpses and limbs</li>
<li>Prevents the game from crashing on systems with more than 10 CPU cores </li>
<li>Corrects the VSync implementation to use the refresh rate selected in the game's settings instead of locking to 30 FPS </li>
<li>Fixes the tracking of Zealot and Hardcore difficulty completions to properly unlock rewards </li>
<li>Resolves item database conflicts where certain DLC suits incorrectly share IDs with other suits </li>
<li>Prevents crashes that can rarely occur when the game enumerates save files </li>
<li>Scales subtitle text appropriately for high resolutions</li>
<li>Implements proper raw mouse input to fix sensitivity issues </li>
<li>Blocks all DirectInput devices except mouse and keyboard to prevent unwanted camera spinning from devices like racing wheels, flight sticks, and other peripherals </li>
<li>Forces anisotropic texture filtering on all textures to improve clarity at oblique viewing angles </li>
<li>Forces proper trilinear filtering for smoother texture transitions between mipmap levels </li>
<li>Prevents connection attempts to EA servers at startup and prevents error messages from appearing </li>
<li>Increases the maximum number of bodies that can remain in the environment </li>
<li>Automatically sets the game to your screen resolution on first launch instead of defaulting to 1024×768 </li>
<li>Bypasses the EA/Visceral Games intro video on launch [when you enable this option]</li>
<li>Control which DLC items appear in the store </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The patch also does funky stuff with dinputto8 for mod compatibility. I say "funky stuff" because I don't know what a "dinputto8" is. It could be incredibly routine and entirely non-funky. For all I know, I'm basically saying "the patch does funky stuff with running on computers powered by electricity". Anyway, all the features can be customised individually. "The patch uses sensible defaults that work for most users, but allows fine-tuning of every aspect," writes Wemino.
</p><p>The odds of a full Dead Space 2 remake seem low at this stage. In April 2024, the rumour was mongered that EA had cancelled such a project in light of the original remake's sales. EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">have denied this</a>, and we've heard barely a squeak of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> since.

<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">Dead Space remake review</a> from January 2023, Liam Richardson (RPS in peace) summarised it as "luxuriously improved in small but considered ways". I myself enjoyed EA Motive's fancy reinterpretation of original developer Visceral's spacecraft setting, but found a lot of it to be adding widgets and sparkle for the sake of it. In particular, I found Isaac Clarke more compelling when he couldn't speak.

            <p>Amid a consumer boycott of their Xbox business, Microsoft are apparently ending the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies used to surveil Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">Guardian</a>, one of the publications who originally exposed the surveillance project, the company told Israeli officials last week that spy agency Unit 8200 had violated Microsoft's terms of service by storing records of civilian phone calls and other data on Azure servers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's vice-chair and president Brad Smith allegedly informed staff of the termination of the Unit 8200 partnership in an email sent on Thursday 18th September, shared with the Guardian. In that email, he said that Microsoft had "ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel ministry of defense", including cloud storage and AI services. "We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians," the email continues. "We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades."</p>
<p>The Guardian also cite another email from a senior Microsoft executive to Israel's ministry of defence, sent late last week, in which the executive noted that "[w]hile our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian's reporting."</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied technology and services to the Israeli military</a> during the latter's current Gaza offensive this May, following an investigation of the alleged use of Microsoft genAI models to facilitate airstrikes, among other operations. </p>

</figure>
<p>In August this year, a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call found that Microsoft had worked with Unit 8200 specifically to create an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">"indiscriminate new system"</a> for gathering data on Palestinians, including a sizeable pool of non-combatants. For context, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war">alleged leaked Israeli military intelligence</a>, around 83% of the tens of thousands of Palestinians reported killed in the current conflict's first 19 months were civilians. </p>
<p>The reporting inspired the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions organisation to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">launch a campaign against Microsoft's gaming business</a>. Microsoft workers have been openly protesting against their employer's involvement with the assault on Gaza since early 2024.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft insisted that they had found "no evidence" that their technology was being used to target or harm Palestinians, following a review carried out by an unnamed third party. In August, a spokesperson announced that they would carry out another review, while insisting that "[a]t no time during this engagement has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>

</figure>
<p>The Guardian claim that as much as 8000 terabytes of intercepted calls were being held in Azure datacentres in the Netherlands as part of the Microsoft/Unit 8200 partnership. The paper adds that Unit 8200 appear to have swiftly moved the data elsewhere in the wake of their reporting. Israel now allegedly plan to transfer it all to Amazon's Web Services cloud platform - neither Amazon nor the Israel Defense Forces have responded to the Guardian's request for comment.</p><p>The reported partial divestment from Israel doesn't reveal which "elements" of the Guardian's reporting Microsoft have corroborated as part of their review. Microsoft continue to have a wider commercial relationship with the Israeli armed forces. They are also far from the only big overseas technology company to have significant dealings with Israel's military, before and during the current invasion and destruction of Gaza - <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">an Associated Press investigation in February</a> also mentions Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle. A UN special rapporteur has accused western tech firms at large of being complicit in an "economy of genocide".</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of developers</a>, including former Microsoft worker Abdo Mohamed, about their participation in the internal <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> movement and the wider BDS action against Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update aiming to smooth out more of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">performance problems</a> which have plagued the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since launch, especially on PC. Unfortuntely, this latest patch looks to have led to an uptick in stuttering for some players, with Gearbox recommending some shader messing around as a potential fix.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the studio, you can't say they haven't been working hard to get Borderlands 4 running a bit more smoothly since problems in that department became apparent, with this being the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-a-new-pc-patch-to-fix-crashes-progression-blockers-and-gpu-related-problems">post-launch patch targeting performance</a> in the past couple of weeks. One of them was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">confusingly noteless</a>, but hey.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, this one <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">has notes</a>, and delving into them you'll find a few tweaks to weekly activities being granted top billing before things descend into fix territory. The weekly big encore boss has been swapped to a tougher version of another existing boss and will offer more loot. The weekly wildcard mission's changed and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has been moved.
</p>
<p>In terms of fixes, Gearbox cited the rectifying of "various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes" as well as "infinite loading screens during crossplay". Characters should also load up faster in menus, and their animations have been updated to match the fixes. Sadly, it seems that the update's actually led some players to experience more performance problems, with Gearbox acknowledging this in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>"Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing," they wrote. "If you're still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer's approved method." If problems persist, you'll have to <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/categories/39763360813843">file a support ticket</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>That aside, studio have also made some changes to rewards and progression with this update, plus some minor tweaks to individual vault hunters. On top of that, there's a bit of gear balancing, with the tweaks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellwalker: now always spawns with Fire element</li>
<li>Tediore weapons: +10% Damage and +10% magazine size</li>
<li>Order Pistol Lucky Clover (Rocket Reload): increased fire rate</li>
<li>Order Sniper Rifle Fisheye: increased Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins has <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643">revealed in a tweet</a> that the game's next patch'll be much heavier on the balancing tweaks. "As a note, we had too many Vault Hunter buffs to safely fit into today's big update," he wrote. "Instead, we broke up them into their own balance update that we're targeting to release early next week instead."</p><p>Here's hoping that Gearbox can get their shooty thing running nicely soon, especially since yapping CEO Randy Pitchford thankfully looks to have stopped giving impromptu setup advice on the socials. As for the game itself, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Jasmine Mannan gave it a go for us</a> and generally liked what these four bordered lands had to offer.</p>
