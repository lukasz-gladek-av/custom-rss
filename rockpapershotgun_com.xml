Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord assured us earlier that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <p>"You will get anywhere between a fairly surgical battle with the more simple moves and synergies, to a downright-drunken-disaster run. [They] act with basically zero understanding of enemy mechanics, no regard for their ability order, and they couldn't give less of a damn about tile hazards." This is a section taken from the description of a mod which turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> into an auto-battler, but turning the controls over to an AI chessmaster. That AI chessmaster just happens to play almost exactly like I have in my seven hours with it thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Seriously, modder Bigbrotherjakeb appears to have found a way to clone me out of sheer desire not to have to play Mewgenics' fights themselves. Their creation, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/8">Auto-Battler Mode</a>', applies the Uncontrollable passive to all of the cats in your party. So, the computer will handle moving them about, targeting enemies, and unleashing abilities. Not that it'll do a good job of any of that. "This is effectively a challenge mode with how dumb the default player AI can be with this implementation (simplest I could quickly find)," the modder wrote.</p>
<p>Cool. Bigbrotherjakeb has hopes of teaching the stupid computer how to pick suitable movement strategies based on the specific class of cat it's controlling in future. I should probably get around to master the same thing.</p>
<p>A couple of other early Mewgenics mods which've caught my eye are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/24?tab=description">Less Cats</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/32">good poop</a>'. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the first one actually results in you having more cats by lowering the number of moggies the game's coterie of weirdos ask for in return for upgrades. As someone who's been a bit sad to part with my retired bois not long after they return from their sole adventure, that sounds good to me.</p><p>Good poop, meanwhile, leaves no room for misinterpretation. Poop now adds two pints to both your cats' health and comfort, rather than dragging it down by the same amount. A relatively small tweak, unless you find a way to play in smellivision further down the road, in which case you might get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the auto-battler mode or less cats a go, both require the Mewgenics Mod Manager dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/1">Mewtator</a>.</p>
<p>Also among the roguelike cat breeder's early mods are a couple which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/29?tab=description">swap around the audio files</a> for in-game meows. This follows criticism directed at the decision of developer Edmund McMillen to include meows voiced by internet personalities such as Ethan and Hila Klein. You can read McMillen's response as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate">our report on the topic</a>.</p>

            <p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has become the latest game to have its initially listed recommended RAM requirement yanked down by a substantial amount, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">following in the footsteps</a> of fellow 2026 release 007: First Light.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers TT Games announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">Steam post</a> that the recommended RAM number for da bat's latest adventure now sits at 16GB rather than the initially announced 32GB.</p>
<p>"Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final," the studio added, citing this revision as being the product of some ongoing testing. "We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215200/LEGO_Batman_Legacy_of_the_Dark_Knight/">rest of the specs</a>, including an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB or Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16GB, remain as they were for now, An SSD is also still listed as a hard requirement in both the recommended and minimum specs.</p>
<p>The RAM revision comes amid what our hardware and occasional kitchenware guru James has dubbed RAMnarok. Basically, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM prices have gone through the roof</a> thanks to vast swaths of it being hoovered up for AI-related uses. So, those selling RAM for use in consumer PCs have had to jack up their prices to offset the beefier sums they're having to fork over to fill up their parts conveyor belts during this RAM shortage or simply to take advantage of the scarcity meaning you'll struggle to get ahold of some at a cheaper price elsewhere.</p><p>It's bad, especially when the knock-on effects for hardware like the recently delayed Steam Machine are taken into account. Hence games like Legacy of the Dark Knight dropping their RAM requirements where testing reveals they can, making them a more attractive proposition to folks who don't want to face the potential of paying through the nose for an upgrade to their existing rigs just to play. If RAM prices weren't soaring, such tweaks wouldn't be as big a deal, but they are, so here we are.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, all! It’s time once again to load the Maw up with new PC games, that we may stave off the apocalypse till next Monday. This week covers a wide spectrum of flavours and textures: papery, Dodo-ish, ducklike, inky, formaldehyde-y, pasty, furry, feculent, and fishy. Once you’re done throwing up, get back here and run your protesting eyes over the full list. As ever, we welcome your urgent suggestions.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720940/Book_Smugglers/">Book Smugglers</a> is a point and click adventure about circulating forbidden texts in 19th century Tsarist Lithuania.  </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362750/Stormbridge/">Stormbridge</a> is a strictly horizontal blend of tower defence and city builder in which you stretch out a settlement rightwards, while raising defences against an encroaching tempest on the left.</li>
<li>For people who want more randomisation and playdough faces in their Ogre Battling, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is a turn-based tactics affair in which characters roll dice each turn to determine the moves they can perform.</li>
<li>Out this day in early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720920/ASTROBOTANICA/">Astrobotanica</a> is a somewhat Crash Bandicoot-esque puzzle ‘n’ survival game in which you are an extra-terrestrial botanist making sense of prehistoric Earth, feat. Neanderthals and Dodos.</li>
<li>Let’s savagely rebut the chonky ‘take me to your chief mammoth hunter’ bonhomie of that last entry with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3885910/Alien_Morgue/">Alien Morgue</a>, in which you do autopsies on little green men. (You don’t appear to be playing a Neanderthal or a Dodo.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time to once again dust off those parched and abraded Zelda memories with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583520/Under_The_Island/">Under The Island</a>, a top-down island dungeon puzzler featuring six biomes replete with grass you can slash to reveal health hearts.</li>
<li>Friendslop’s bottomless chum bucket has claimed Cthulhu in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140720/Ritual_Party/">Ritual Party</a>, which is about four buds (or <em>are</em> you?) trying to perform a hellish ritual. Please, somebody help me think of a non-pejorative word for “friendslop” that rolls off the tongue as easily. The best I have are “Overcookie” and “Lethalcomp”.</li>
<li>No time for friendslop, actually, for today marks the dawning of duck-builders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">Placid Plastic Deck: A Quiet Quest</a> (pictured) is a deeply suspicious card-battler.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714150/Beyond_the_Doors/">Beyond The Doors</a> is a finicky surveillance sim in which you accept mysterious requests to bug your neighbours, while probing the enigmas of the architecture itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3514630/Roach_Post/">Roach Post</a> is a cheery roguelite puzzler in which you stick together postage stamps with the help of an army of cockroaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Forgotlings</a> is a posh-looking, VA-heavy action adventure set in a world of discarded sentient objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice cavernous origami world you’ve got there, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4240550/Blank/">Blank</a>. Shame if somebody were to platform all over it.</li>
<li>Equal parts horny, despairing and whimsical, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878760/KILL_THE_WITCH/">Kill The Witch</a> is an early access 2D action platformer in which you are a witch with a baseball bat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/">The Killing Stone</a> is an Inscryptic confection from the makers of The Blackout Club. You are in the Arctic, playing a cursed boardgame to save the souls of a noble family from the Devil.</li>
<li>The criminal absence of licensed music notwithstanding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> looks to be a pleasant “what if”-driven strategy management port of TV’s definitive trip to the Delta Quadrant. Off to the Transporter room with you, Neelix - you’re doing a one-man-raid on the Borg Cube.</li>
<li>People who pre-fur the Star Foxy breed of space sim might want to throw their pennies at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/"> FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>. Neelix’s tufty mug wouldn’t look out of place here, now that I think of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today brings quite the haul. Let’s barge through them at pace. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse</a> is a sun-baked mystery horror novel in which an ensemble cast wrangle with some ghastly fishwomen.</li>
<li>The N64-to-Gamecube era lives on in “expressive” platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Demon Tides</a>, which casts you as a transforming devil princess.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a> is your latest helping of putrid and snarky open world goblin stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">Love Eternal</a> is an introspective horror platformer we might blithely summarise as Playdead X Celeste. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Key Fairy</a> is a “hand-drawn, pacifist, folkloric, bullet-hell” game in which you grapple past monsters, salvaging their shattered stars, and solve riddles in a forest of scratchy blood and ink.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">Nightsoil</a> is possibly the first turd collection game I’ve covered, and certainly the first emotive turd collection game I’ve covered.</li>
<li>Get the sense that all is not well on this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622230/MOONROT/">particular gas giant moon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple more before we go gently into that good Friday night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949290/Ys_X_Proud_Nordics/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is an updated version of a 2023 entrant in the sprawling Ys series, best known (to me, anyway) for popularising the concept of bumpslash combat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525970/Horripilant/">Horripilant</a> is an incremental dungeon clicker about an old knight in a world of Junji Ito-esque filthbastards.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on in the Treehouse this week? James is biffing several larger hardware stories, and threatening to educate the rest of us about teraflops. Mark wants to walk the desert – hurting, longing, dancing to disco music. Julian may have an awkward tale to tell about a PC game he shouldn’t admit to have played. I am thinking about open worlds and city builders, because I am nothing if not shackled to genre. Callum is biding his time before the Requiem, and Ollie is eyeing the months ahead through a telescope (and also, possibly playing more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>). Jeremy ain’t in yet. How about you?</p>
