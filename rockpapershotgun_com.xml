            <p>The ongoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM shortage</a> (and subsequent and pricing explosion) is imposing a wider range of grim effects than even the Great GPU Famine of 2020. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">First came the death</a> of one of gaming hardware’s most reliable memory and SSD makers, and now... uh... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Larian’s new Divinity game</a> is going to be more optimised for PC than it otherwise would have been?</p>
<p>That’s what Larian CEO Swen Vincke (clearly on a media tour – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">here’s him discussing Divinity with our Edwin</a>) told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-divinity-development-changed-ram-prices/">TheGamer</a>, anyway. Vincke notes that because the lack of affordable RAM options is making it harder to predict the horsepower of future PCs, "we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time." That doesn’t sound especially horrible to me – higher performance on lower-end rigs ultimately means more players can join in – though nowhere in the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/larian-studios-swen-vincke-interview-divinity/">full interview</a> does Vincke acknowledge that the shortage is being directly caused and sustained by demand from data centres that power generative AI, a technology that Larian are using in Divinity’s production, and that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally?event_category=Login+success&amp;event_action=Email">Vincke himself is defending the use of</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be chugging potions out of six-fingered hands, or leading your party into the homely village of Ecwwhehw. Larian’s boss man is adamant that "We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI," with the company supposedly limiting their genAI application to things like placeholder text and references for concept artists.</p>
<p>Without wanting to prosecute yet another argument about it – not this late in the afternoon, at least – I still don’t think that approach addresses the problems with environmental damage, unauthorised scraping, or even really labour replacement that genAI continues to swirl around in. It’s also a fact that <em>any</em> usage of tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Adobe Firefly, however limited, adds demand to those data centres that are hogging all our RAM sticks.</p><p>This effects of this artificial memory shortage, again, extend far beyond how well Divinity will run on 16GB of DDR4. Soaring prices are <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/dont-wait-if-youre-planning-to-upgrade-your-ram-or-ssd-kingston-rep-warns-says-prices-will-continue-to-go-up-nand-costs-up-246-percent">expected to last well into 2026</a>, with production costs for laptops, pre-built PCs and possibly games consoles passed onto consumers, while Valve are rumoured to be reconsidering both their pricing and launch date plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">new Steam Machine</a>. Even hardware heavyweights Nvidia are <a href="https://overclock3d.net/news/gpu-displays/nvidia-plans-heavy-cuts-to-gpu-supply-in-early-2026/">reportedly</a> cutting GPU production plans, due to a lack of available GDDR7 memory, and their own supplying of graphics chips to the genAI industry has made them the richest company on Earth.</p>

            <p>As the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> emerges from a hole in the ground with a cog-shaped door, Todd Howard has uttered the word Fallout and stuck a five after it. He's given a verbal thumbs up - or a reminder depending on how you look at it - to the idea of the events which play out in the TV show having an impact on the next mainline entry on the series, at least in terms of being a consideration in worldbuilding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Beeb's Newsbeat</a> whether the show will have an impact on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, cleanliness is next to Toddliness replied: "In short, yes." "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," he expanded. "We are taking that into account."</p>
<p>Based on the phrasing, I'd assume all he's likely talking about here is the need for the likes of terminal entries or other in-game lore whisperings which refer to places in the post-apocalyptic US that the show has touched to mirror what the adaptation says took place. For example, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">everyone's brains getting very foggy</a> following the second battle of Hoover Dam. Or, well, all that bollocks around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesdas-todd-howard-clarifies-the-fate-of-shady-sands-in-the-fallout-tv-show-timeline">the NCR capital going boom</a>, which I honestly just thought was a rather unnecessary can of worms for the show to have opened.</p>
<p>Is any of that, or possible cheeky references to the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, stuff I'm particularly bothered about the next single-player Fallout containing whenever it finally arrives? Not really, no. Then again, I've been clear in my view that I reckon the show'd likely benefit from its creators not having to dedicate so much time to debates involving the word canon. Is it nice to have all your things' worlds nicely slot together in a way that can serve the wider narrative by layering together a shared history - and also result in them being neatly corporately synergised? Yeah, it is, but at the same time, that wider lore building should ideally serve the key stories being told in the here and now of a game or show first and foremost, not the other way around.</p><p>With both the showrunners and the Todd having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-3-will-be-filmed-next-summer-if-all-goes-plan-showrunners-as-its-showrunners-want-to-keep-their-big-iron-in-the-fire">kicked off chatter about a third series</a> prior to the latest one even going live, the Howard has also revealed - this time to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">Variety</a> - that the two sides are already hard at work deciding how they can do Fallout game stuff to coincide with that next series.</p>
<p>"For us on the game and TV show side, we’re writing season three now," Fairly Todd Parents said. "We’re having those conversations now of, what are we doing in season three for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don’t feel forced or fake." So, more crossover like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Gogginsy Burning Springs update</a> being lined up ahead of time, which to be fair is vastly superior to people having to shout en-masse 'Where be the new Fallouty bits now you've whetted my appetite?'</p>
<p>Fallout 5, as of writing, is still without a release date. One assumes that it'll drop around the year 453689386890290906789, a little bit after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">The Elder Scrolls 6 arrives in 303689386890290906789</a>.</p>
