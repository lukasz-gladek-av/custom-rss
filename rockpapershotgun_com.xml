            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">recent cancellation</a>, the original founder of Hypixel Studios has said that he plans to reach out to Riot Games in an effort to buy back the game and release a version of it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has seemingly responded to a fan asking him if he'd be open to getting involved in efforts to ressurect the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/og-hytale-founder-confirms-he-will-reach-out-to-riot-games-about-buying-back-the-minecraft-rival-the-chances-of-revival-are-next-to-impossible-its-the-least-i-can-do/">GamesRadar</a>, following a lengthy back-and-forth on the tweeter last week, original Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme indicated that he plans to get in touch with Riot about Hytale, in an effort to re-acquire and revive it.</p>
<p>If this is successful, he may get a "very early access" version with "temporarily removed features" out the door, having previously discussed the idea of investing something like $25 million in an effort to finish a legacy engine iteration of Hytale that'd have a reduced scope, and be PC only to start off with.</p>
<p>"I will reach out, however remember it will take a while, give it some time," he wrote, "It will take months to get answers and months to get done. I will share as much as possible as I go through the process."  
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">To clarify, it would require a LOT less money to get to something that could be released in «&nbsp;Very Early Access&nbsp;» with temporarily removed features. We could just get the community involved ASAP in modding / bug reports / feature requests / crowdfunding and find ways to use… <a href="https://t.co/E8Ok3VIVDc">pic.twitter.com/E8Ok3VIVDc</a></p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1938944710334148817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's important to note that Collins-Laflamme was pretty upfront that this may well never come to fruition. "Keep your expectations extremely low because usually when large companies shutdown a project like this the chances of revival are next to impossible," the founder explained, "Yes, I made the decision, I will give my best to save Hytale. Even if it’s [a] 1% chance. Its the least I can do to the same community that gave me the opportunity to be where I am today."</p>
<p>The group of fans that Collins-Laflamme has been talking to about the longshot Hytale revival have been exploring other opportunities, with one of them <a href="https://x.com/not_mynes/status/1938700223511159281">seemingly having reached out</a> to Stardew Valley creator Barone via Discord to ask if he'd be interested in getting involved. "Possibly, but I would have to hear more about what the plan is, why it failed initially (behind the scenes), etc," is the answer the dev is claimed to given in response.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Barone for comment.</p>
<p>We'll have to see if anything comes of these efforts to revive Hytale, but as of right now, the chance of anything happening very much hinges on Riot and looks to be pretty slim. I'd not bet my house on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Welcome, friend, to the good year of 2025. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavengers_Reign">Scavengers Reign</a> has just been renewed for its third season, Greggs have starting doing their festive bake all year round, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-remake">Dead Space remake</a> sold gangbusters.</p>
<p>Wait, no, sorry. This is the bad timeline. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scavengers">Scavengers</a> Reign was acquired by a company who actively balk at anything people might want to watch with their entire faces, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> apparently didn't sell well enough for <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1778128923466903868">EA to greenlight more</a>. It's with a certain melancholy then, that I recommend the Steam Summer sale's offering of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/">Dead Space remake</a> at 80% off (£10/€12/$12/perhaps a sillier price if you live somewhere <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1llwzls/steam_automatic_regional_pricing_is_outdated_last/">Valve doesn't consider important</a>).</p>
<p>Deep discounts aren't always a sure indicator of success in either direction, of course. The brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/">50% off its already very generous usual price</a> and <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">apparently did very well</a>. But I can't help get abandoned bargain bin vibes from this one. It deserved so much better.</p><!--more-->

<p>I've already written basically everything I want to say about why I love Dead Space so much <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/why-dead-spaces-ishimura-feels-so-authentically-terrifying-3377902">elsewhere</a>. As curt and nuance-muffling as such labels are, it feels almost dismissive to call the remake 'perfect' and be done with it, but that's basically how I feel about it. It recreates so well while leaving well alone. Curb-stomps with the lightest touch. So much of the Ishimura's mood is about how light and sound echo in its murky spaces - how it obscures and teases lurking horrors. In scaling up some environments and making others feel that much more tangible, the remake set itself the task of interpretation instead of just imitation; a task I reckon it pulled off with real soul. Maybe this faithfulness is what damned it. It does initially seem workmanlike next to something like the Resi 4 Remake, but that same quiet confidence struck me as containing an immense amount of creativity in holding on to the original's spirit.</p>
<p>Anyway, do give it a go if you haven't had a chance yet. Liam was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">fond of it too in his review</a>. What's sad and strange is this wasn't even the only "great but actually devastating if you think about it for a moment" discount I noticed over the weekend. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545560/Shadow_Gambit_The_Cursed_Crew/">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a> is 75% off, a game I bought but won't be able to play without <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">feeling wistful for developer Mimimi</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you'd like to see more posts in the experimental 'melancholy commerce' genre. GOG is also having a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2025_summer_sale">Summer Sale at the moment</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-space-remake-is-brilliantly-devastatingly-80-off-in-the-steam-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p>This week in PC gaming news my flat continues to feel like a fondue served in a grizzly bear's armpit. Readers in equatorial latitudes may sneer at what we in the UK are pleased to call a "heatwave", but you have to remember that British people are all descended from ice trolls, and that we live in small volcanoes dug out by steampunk druids who thought the glaciers would return sometime in the year 1963.</p>
<p>There is only one way to escape the sun's hatred round these parts, and that is by immersing yourself in some kind of interactive entertainment product, while strenuously pretending that you no longer have skin. Here are some new releases.</p><!--more-->
<ul>
<h2>Monday 30th June</h2>
<li><p>I'm listing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583240/LEO_Low_Earth_Orbit/">LEO: Low Earth Orbit</a> mostly for the lounge jazz interpretation of Clair De Lune in the trailer, but I do like the spangly Etch-A-Sketch visuals and the fact that your guns shunt you away from what you're shooting at. If you want more greasy croutons in your gameplay salad, you may prefer the wilderness exploration and grid-puzzle trading of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378330/Rekindled_Trails/">Rekindled Trails</a>. Alternatively, head back to the arid plains of Monster Hunter Wilds, where the croutons have teeth and wings - there's a big title update due today.</p></li>
<h2>Tuesday 1st July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3675720/Seven_Days_Until_Morning/">Seven Days Until Morning</a> is an artsy horror game about the end of humanity. It's set on Pluto, the coldest planet (or is it? Astronomers love to argue about this) in the solar system. Let's all go live on Pluto. The frozen methane is extra-crispy this time of year.</p></li>
<h2>Wednesday 2nd July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play game about breaking mechs. There are also customisable anime girl pilots with jiggle physics. I'm told by a few other journalists that the game is good regardless. We shall see. I'm not sure I trust these "journalist" people. If you have no interest in mechs, why not <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549930/Ostrich_Farm/">"breed vibrant ostriches"</a>.</p></li>
<h2>Thursday 3rd July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3475750/FLOWorlds/">FLOWorlds</a> is about terraforming hexagonal planets by dropping frozen shards from orbit. Ah, this is the stuff. I am rubbing my face against the screen in anticipation.</p></li>
<h2>Friday 4th July</h2>
<li><p>Today <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesthehuman.itch.io/post/3lsomsxlmus2b">should mark the launch</a> of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/no-ice-in-california">No ICE in California</a> charity bundle, which is based on a game jam campaign against the oppression and mistreatment of migrants in the USA. All proceeds from the bundle will go to <a href="https://raicestexas.org/">RAÍCES</a> and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What are the Treehouse up to this week? Melting mostly, but Mark is also looking into the fall of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> while Nic is sizing up a potential diary feature. Brendy may or may not be interested in meching some new robot friends. Jeremy has finally escaped Roblox guides prison while Ollie is back at the boss-ranking, and I am doing a couple more SGF write-ups. Pray for us. Pray for the coming of evening.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-mecha-break-ice-protest-charity-bundles-and-vibrant-ostrich-farming]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I have thus far in my life avoided playing any factory automation games because I only ever see them recommended in the same breath as dire warnings and laments. "Play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/infinifactory">Infinifactory</a>! It ruined my life! ", "I now exclusively play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/opus-magnum">Opus Magnum</a> inside the skip that is now my home after my family kicked me out. 10/10!", etc etc. But the way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/number-machine">Number Machine</a>'s extendo-arm hex pushes sets of tiles has awakened something in me. Taking a sprawling genre and making it tiny and a bit pastel is basically a genre unto itself now but one I'm a supporter of. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Number Machine is an open-ended factory and automation game with math mechanics," touts the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231090/Number_Machine">Steam page</a>. "Move, combine, split, destroy, and modify numbered orbs with math to form the required structures with specific shapes and values". Maths, you say? Ah, but look at the little pushy arm go! "Use conveyors, pushers, lasers, magnetism, rotators, and much more to create an efficient system". See, now you're speaking my language, and it's a language that was shaped, moulded and tempered in the white-hot crucible of 1990's puzzler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine">The Incredible Machine</a>.</p>
<p>This one is from Arielek, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1383250/Please_Fix_The_Road">Please Fix The Road</a> fame. We've never covered it, but a lot of other outlets did and enjoyed it, based on the happy little Steam quotes. Eurogamer even slapped a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/please-fix-the-road-is-a-polite-yet-fiendish-little-puzzle-game">'recommended' sticker on it</a> - a veritable 'triple sumptuous' on the EG scale. Number Machine is due out sometime next year.
