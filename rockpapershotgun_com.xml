            Former Ridgeline Games boss and Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto has spoken out against the diminished representation of certain old Ridgeline colleagues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s credits, pointing out that some have been "entirely omitted" despite their years of work laying the "foundation" for EA's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>.


</p><!--more-->
<p>Ridgeline were once pretty central to Battlefield 6. Back in 2022, they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">unveiled as the creators of the next Battlefield singleplayer campaign</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shut them down</a> in the course of mass layoffs over February 2024, with some Ridgeline staff being transferred to another Battlefield studio, Ripple Effect.
</p>
<p>"I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," Lehto wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/">a LinkedIn post yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered," he went on. "Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits -- and several were omitted entirely, including myself.
</p>
<p>"Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them -- listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits. Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."
</p><p>Specifically, Lehto cites software engineers Jessica Moore and Dan Carr, lead tech artist Rohan Knuckey, and lead character artist Andres Naranjo as having been unfairly overlooked. He credits himself as vice president, studio general manager and franchise director. Here's a video of the full official BF6 credit reel, for context.</p>

<p>Incomplete crediting of developers is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/18/video-game-credits-policy/">one of the persistent evils</a> that affects big budget games. Developers may labour on a game for the best part of a decade and come away without an appropriate namecheck, because they left or were laid off before shipping. External contributors and people in certain, devalued areas of game creation <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/translators-and-external-developers-reportedly-missing-from-baldurs-gate-3-credits">are more prone to being left out</a>. Sometimes, the threat of a withheld credit is used as a cudgel to stop people resigning from roles they hate.</p>
<p>All that said, it's worth noting that Lehto's reading of Battlefield 6's credits is a bit sketchy. As he acknowledges in the comments on that LinkedIn post, three of the people he says EA have omitted are actually cited elsewhere in the credits.</p>

            <p>Fingers have been pointed regarding the ROG Xbox Ally X's beefy £800 / $1000 price tag. Xbox, whose name is on the handheld, have pointed to collaborators Asus as having spearheaded that decision, with president Sarah Bond saying that it came down to the hardware company's assessment of what'd be acceptable to charge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware," Bond told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a>. "That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices."</p>
<p>"I feel really good about the value that we’re giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware," she added.</p>
<p>As our James acknowledged in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox Ally X review</a>, the handheld's price certainly doesn't leave it a no brainer bargain, but isn't massively out of step with what other handhelds go for:</p>
<blockquote>The fact that it costs £800 (or a crisp $1000 in the US) doesn’t help, but then the MSI Claw 8 AI+ already proved that it can be worth splashing out if framerates and practicality are up to premium standards. The ROG Xbox Ally X sometimes makes the cut, though is just as often outpolished or outlasted by its peers, and even suffers from outright faults that undermine Asus and Microsoft’s genuinely good UX work.</blockquote>
<p>I'm having a little trouble believing that Xbox, whose CEO Phil Spencer made no secret of how much he pines for the handhelds prior to pulling the trigger on an Xbox-branded one, didn't have any say in the figure which was stuck on the box. If you're putting your company's name on the thing and want to minimise the potential that has to backfire, surely the price is one of the elements on your radar to discuss thoroughly, even if you think you're likely going to be happy trusting in Asus' cited mountains of wisdom.</p><p>Then again, an exec earning massive wads of cash to make these sorts of calls and deals I am not. Plus, there's the much-discussed issue of US tarrifs and their potential impact on the cost of goods like the like the Xbox Ally X, which seemed to be alluded to via the phrase "time to figure the macroeconomic impact to pricing" when Asus and Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">opted to push back announcing the handheld's price</a> by a couple of months.</p>

            <p>Time to phone Genghis Khan. Tell him the news. There's gonna be a bit more waiting before you can become 13th century Mongolia's a truest Yam courier rider/horse befriender. Following its latest Steam Next Fest demo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">The Legend of Khiimori</a>'s early access release has been pushed back to March next year.</p>
<p>I know, throw down your spurs like they're Yosemite Sam's hat. There's neigh way developers Aesir Interactive and NightinGames have done this to you. Well, they have, but they say they've got the game's best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The equine delivery sim's now set to emerge from early access on March 3rd, 2026, its developers have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2697000/view/519727718097487890?l=english">announced</a>. "The wonderful reception during Steam Next Fest has led to us sitting down with our publisher and together we have decided to take more time to create a more feature and content-rich experience," they wrote. "While this does mean that you all have to wait a little longer to get your hands on Khiimori, it also means we’ll be able to make sure you get a better game when we do release into Early Access."</p><p>Alongside fleshing Khiimori out with extra features, Aesir say their "main priorities" include improving "player guidance and world experience", as well as the camera, controls, and interface. They also plan to make some performance tweaks to help the game run a bit more smoothly and lower its fairly lofty minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>To help tide the bronco busters of the Steam corral over, the game's Next Fest demo has stuck around past the conclusion of the great demopocalypse and won't disappear until November 30th. So, if like me you've not had a chance to give it a go yet, there's an extra month or so to find a saddle.</p>
<p>I am keen to try it, though, despite not being a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> enjoyer. There's something in its description of breeding and caring for a steed as you negotiate delivery routes you've plotted out, occasionally stopping to forage or shoot a thing with your bow, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s wilderness-wandering. Or, like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> with mares instead of Mack lorries.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find The Legend of Khiimori's lingering demo if you gallop over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697000/The_Legend_of_Khiimori/">Steam page</a>.</p>
