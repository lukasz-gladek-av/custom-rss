            <p>
A group of fangame developers have taken it upon themselves to make a new Sonic Rush game for PC, combining the previous Sonic Rush games for Nintendo DS into one "definitive" remastering, with extra stuff and some apparently overdue fixes. Seems bold! I missed the Rush games back in the noughties, but I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">do like me a Sonic</a>. Here's a trailer for Sonic Rush Rerun.

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5mGwM-uikw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
"The idea behind this remaster is to take the greatest strengths of the Sonic Rush trilogy, crank them up to 11, and combine them together to bring this game formula to its PEAK," explain the developers in the blurb. "We want to make a definitive version of Sonic Rush for PC with additional content and to fix the problems with the original game." I assume they're calling it a "trilogy" in light of the general conviction that Sonic Colors is an unofficial third Rush game.
</p>
<p>
I like the energy here, but I fear I must break off this report to deliver an agonising Old Man appraisal of something that has been bugging me for years. PSA game developers: the "up to 11" line is not supposed to be repeated sincerely. It comes from 1984 rock band mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE">there's a scene</a> where lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel shows off his custom amp, which has a volume setting with 11 levels, but isn't actually any louder than an amp with 10 levels. 
</p><p>
It's supposed to be a joke about meaningless exaggeration. But because humans are forgetful, perishable sacks of meat, and perhaps because videogame-adjacent humans especially tend to venerate numbers like gods, I keep hearing the phrase "turn it up to 11" uttered <em>with what sounds like full seriousness</em>.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if there's some kind of central marketing authority I can appeal to, here, but please can you all knock it off, because whenever I read these words in press releases, I feel like I am taking crazy pills. If nothing else, game developers, the nature of the joke means that you don't have to stop at 11. You can turn it up to 12! You can turn it up to 13, even! First one to turn it up to 13 in a press release gets their game an automatic 13/10. Or would do, if we had a scoring system. See, I always give myself an out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Sonic Rush Rerun. The project lead is MelohRush, who got into fan animations because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> and thought it needed "an extra punch of style". These youngsters! So impetuous. According to <a href="https://melohrush.carrd.co/">his portfolio</a>, he's worked on *grits teeth* 11 Sonic projects to date. 
</p>
<p>
He's joined by lead programmer Crimznraze, lead modeller Ozark and a small village of modellers, programmers, level designers, animators, sprite artists, composers, sound designers, voice actors, writers and graphic designers. It's a tidy production. You can find some music for the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SonicRushRerun">the Youtube page</a>.
</p><p>
Sonic Rush Rerun has no release date. Thanks to Jeremy for spotting it and lobbing it into the friendly sausage machine that is our news Slack. As ever with fangames, its eventual launch rests on Sega's willingness not to sue the pants off the creators for breach of copyright. Sega have proven pretty relaxed on this front, as large corporations go, and have reaped the fruits in the form of a lively community of Sonicmakers, busily engineering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-are-the-nostalgic-2d-sonic-fangames-but-sonic-galactic-might-be-the-best">forms of hedgehog-based entertainment</a> poor Yuji Naka never dreamed of in 1991. Some have gone onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">work for the Blue Blur directly</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Terminid spelunking update, dubbed Into the Unjust, has dropped from orbit today, September 2nd. Sadly, that hellpod's impact with the game's surface looks to have triggered an uptick in crash reports, and Arrowhead are now busy "working to isolate fixes".</p>
<p>If you missed the update's announcement the other day, Edwin was strapped into the news driver's seat at the time, and has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">nice rundown of what's in it here</a>. He even consulted some very real geographers, the absolute pro. The short version? Terminid cave missions on Hive Worlds to aid Super Earth's efforts to fight an evil cloud, and some new enemies flying around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sadly, as Arrowhead have been admirably transparent about in the past, new additions to Helldivers 2 tend to bring with them a helping of new issues that need shooting into submission. Into the Unjust's been no different, with a wave of fresh crash reports leading community manager Katherine Baskin to let players know via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1412450267361706018">Discord</a> that the devs are on the case.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the issues with crashing, which are NOT in accordance with Super Earth Standards and we are working to isolate fixes now. We apologize for this delay and will report back with updates soon," she wrote. Phew, now the many folks writing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/search/?q=crash&amp;type=posts&amp;t=hour&amp;cId=fb662426-0a5e-4086-836f-d0ebaa1542be&amp;iId=a6e9c0ab-df8d-4b22-9fab-ab9d8c622382">their own individual Reddit posts</a> about encountering crashes can chill out a bit.
</p><p>Speaking of the Helldivers 2 subreddit, in my trip there to check just how widespread the crash chatter was, I ran into a number of folks also registering their unhappiness at quite how beefy the game's file size is getting on PC. As someone who's had the update installing onto my games box since late this morning, and as of yet hasn't had it finish patching all of its files, that really hit me where I live.</p>
<p>It'd be unwise to assume that the file size is the only factor contributing to Helldivers 2 taking a while to update - I'm usually the first to go the other way and assume the problem must be on my end - but given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6f0sf/todays_update_has_now_put_the_pc_build_size_at/">a thread on the subject</a>'s amassed 9.1k upvotes and just under 800 comments in about six hours, landing near the top of the subreddit, it's maybe worth Arrowhead looking into. That said, in my case there's also the fact I've been using my PC to do my job while Into the Unjust's been downloading, and that may well have had an impact.</p>
<p>Regardless, I've got some bug spelunking planned for tonight, so you may well hear about my travails if anything noteworthy or wacky happens.</p>

I guess the simplest way to describe Jitter is that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a>, the hectic spaceship hijacking game from Suspicious Developments, but you are the spaceship, not the hijacker, and also, you can glue pieces of other ships onto yourself, like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/captain-forever">Captain Forever</a>, and also, this looks a bit like Lemmings on the Game Boy. Boil that down, and we have a brand new subgenre, the Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike, which... let's maybe forget I wrote the words "Hot Lemming Boy Foreverlike". Let's proceed without further reflection to this video showcasing the combat.

<p>
If the above description confuses and alarms you, there's a cleaner one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/">the game's Steam page</a>. "Jitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt," it reads. "You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents."
</p>
<p>
Cue impressive scenes of your greenish top-down AI core chewing through asteroids like a lemming through a baguette. Shoo, lemming! That's my lunch, not an asteroid, and since when do lemmings eat asteroids, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
No time for lunch, though, because it's time to talk about simulation systems. As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a>, you'll organise the generation and flow of power and oxygen around your craft as you expand it, ensuring that you still, for example, have the means to swiftly fix hull breaches while adding gun turrets to the design. It might sound like it requires a shedload of menus, but the largely mouse-based controls are quite simple for a game of this fiddliness. There's a demo on Steam, if you'd like to try for yourself.
</p><p>
If the idea of playing an AI seems dry, may I draw your attention to the line above about your crew. It consists of named humans with fetching character portraits and bespoke abilities. You'll shepherd them through boarding actions, opening airlocks and tactically clicking rooms to have them survive against greater numbers. Beware: if you lose one of the story-critical ones, it's game over. This seems to rule out the possibility of being an Evil AI, alas, though there's definitely scope for venting the odd humanoid in a fit of cybernetic pique. 
</p>
<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Jitter, though it's a bit too processing-intensive for my work laptop, with all manner of physics-enabled celestial body bouncing around the playing field. There's no release date yet, but developers Berko Games posted in June that they're now focussing on "the final major updates before our Early Access release".</p>
<p>Their practical difficulties include living in Ukraine, a country that has been fighting off a Russian invasion for three and a half years. "It's not easy working under drone and missile strikes, but your attention and support should remain focused on the game itself," the developers comment briefly in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2877660/view/541108949283242521?l=english">a recent update</a> about the game's NPC vessel behaviour.

            <p>February 1st, 2021. Until yesterday, that was the last time Ubisoft had posted anything on the official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman</a> Tweeter account. That outstanding streak has been broken because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platforming series</a> has turned 30, promting the publisher to reaffirm that a team of devs is still busy working on Rayman's future, with news to come, er, not very soon.</p>
<p>Before you shout at me for writing about a games company posting that, yes, they still plan to make video games in the future, this is also a chance to highlight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGyqe1t_JU&amp;t=2s">Rayman Alive 2025</a>, a pretty hefty community showcase of fan projects helping to keep the aged limbless being's legacy alive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an appearance at the end of that fan-run event, Rayman producer Loic Gounon and composer Christophe Heral did all the thanking you'd expect, while also providing that brief update on Raymond Man's status. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman," Gounon reaffirmed. "Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>Heral then whipped out a rather delightful banjo and delivered some sweet tuneage while Rayman stood on a plant leaf next to him, blankly staring into the void. Ubisoft added that the likes of exclusive concept art and behind-the-scenes dev interviews will be put out in the coming months.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p><p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p></div>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Anyway, this served as the climax of Rayman Alive 2025, which is organised by <a href="https://x.com/VnheardVoices">Vnheard</a>, creator of unofficial Raymanimated series <a href="https://x.com/Rayman_SL">Rayman: Scepter of Leptys</a>. There were cameos from a whole host of Rayfan projects throught the showcase, including Rayman: Origins mod <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/617018">Ales Origins</a>, fan comic <a href="https://x.com/clairiphi/status/1962604349277843650">Rayman Nightmarish</a>, and <a href="https://raymanbeatbox.tonocatmeow.com/">Rayman Legends Beatbox</a>, the latter of which you can fire up in your browser and have Rayman shred some fat bass guitar riffs as you work.</p>
<p>There's a full list of featured projects in the description, and as ever with these sorts of community showcases, there's a chance you'll find something you dig in there. Hey, given how long it might be until Ubisoft do a Rayman tweet again, the Rayfans'll need it.</p>
