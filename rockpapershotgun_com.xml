            <p>Microsoft have delivered a timely reminder that AI isn’t just effective at injecting ugly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">soulless</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">anti-art</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-player-convinces-one-of-the-games-npcs-theyre-pregnant-with-his-baby">nonsense robochat</a> into your games – it also has the power to ruin your entire PC.</p>
<p>MS recently <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">updated a support article</a> explaining the 'agentic AI' features they plan to roll out for Windows 11, which involve creating a separate desktop instance and allowing AI 'agents' to perform supposedly menial tasks (like file sorting and email sending) within it. All while you kick back on your main workspace, online shopping for the third yacht that the AI revolution has surely enabled you to afford. Unfortunately, among the agents’ capabilities is the risk of installing malware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, the article warns that agentic AI may "introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.” Sounds awful. Terrible! Clearly not the kind of vulnerability that Microsoft could possibly allow to stand and oh no wait they’re going through with it anyway, with the first experimental versions already being live via the Windows Insider programme.</p>
<p>There are token safeguards: the 'agent workspace' is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by someone with admin privileges. But it’s hardly reassuring when the only way to use these features safely is to <em>not</em> use them, at all. And you would stay at effectively zero risk of XPIA attacks if you didn't, as these types of malware are engineered to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">target large language models</a> (LLMs) rather than humans.</p><p>It’s likely inevitable that Windows 11 will swell up with agentic AI at some point; Microsoft have been talking about it for months, and with Windows 10 having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">lost (of all things) its security updates</a>, it’s not like fleeing to the older OS is a long-term alternative. But putting it in users’ hands when the AI involved hasn’t been sufficiently trained to avoid obvious, often plain-English phishing or malware injection scams is <em>spectacular</em> arrogance. Unless it’s some kind of Valve inside job to make us all buy SteamOS-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machines</a>, but I’m not sure their wheelie desks would roll that far.</p>
<p>Motoring critics often use the phrase "Car Brain" to illustrate how otherwise rational, sensible drivers suddenly lose their empathy and perception functions as soon as they sit behind a steering wheel. I’d like to propose the usage of "AI Brain" to describe the phenomena of ostensibly intelligent technologists instantly abandoning any sense of responsibility, creativity, good product design, and in many cases, basic human decency the minute they have artificial intelligence in front of their face. AI Brain can be easily identified through symptoms such as excessive LinkedIn posting and the vocalisation of gibberish about how their company <em>needs</em> to steal other people’s work, actually.</p>

            Back in 2022, Sin began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-terra-invicta-is-too-much-for-one-article-and-possibly-one-lifetime">her impressions</a> of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> with the comment that "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live."
</p><p>Further down the page there are horrifying phrases like "makes Europa Universalis seem limited" and "every planet and moon and asteroid, all orbiting in real time", woven through a fascinating account of a game that is sort of XCOM, but you're organising a whole Earth's worth of competing countries and factions to repel solar system invaders who may not even materialise for dozens of hours. But <em>of course</em> Hooded Horse are publishing it. This was one of their first signings, I believe. Those sickos.</p>

<p>The hour of reckoning is nigh. Developers Pavonis Interactive have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1176470/view/599669316683563056?l=english">just released</a> the last major Terra Invicta update before the 1.0 release, which is still undated. The update adds 50 new Early regions, a starting scenario in 2070 that skips you forward to the maturation of interplanetary travel technologies, various AI and performance improvements, and the ability to mount an expedition to the asteroid Apophis in the year 2029, this being when that 20 million tonne boulder will next pass close to Earth.</p>
<p>The creators of Terra Invicta appear hell-bent on representing the real-life status and likely development of space tech, geopolitics and the motions of celestial bodies. The 1.0 release will add a 2026 scenario "with the world situation updated to the present day". This meticulousness prompts the worry that perhaps there <em>is</em> an alien invasion underway and this game is secretly an interface for the actual global resistance. Are you doing an Ender's Game on us, Pavonis? Because I should not be allowed within three lightyears of any command bunker. I'm the guy who forgets which character he is in fighting games.</p>
<p>Here's a full bulletpoint rundown of the 1.0 update.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>More than 50 new regions on Earth, along with new nations, breakaways, and formables, along with new mechanics for region annexation and federations. We also updated Earth's boost values for the 2022 scenario to match Earth's actual launch capabilities during that year.</li>
<li>The "2070" scenario, in which interplanetary travel has been achieved and all factions start with some space assets already built. Many nations on Earth are consolidated into regional powers with the intent to create greater balance between their stats and initial capabilities, so there are lots of strategies on Earth and in space to explore.</li>
<li>A "realistic" combat mode in which ships are closer to their actual size and propellant consumption at high acceleration increases dramatically. The older mode is still available and now called "cinematic" combat so you can play how you like!</li>
<li>New hab modules, including solar mirrors to support solar power on surface habs on Mars, asteroids, and Jupiter, spy modules to give bonuses to the oppression priority and detecting enemy councilors on Earth, and climate modules that give bonuses to the environment priority.</li>
<li>A bunch of new events, including "Peace Dividend," where nations without rivals can trade military capability for economic benefits; "Officer's Insight," where a high-ranking ship officer can propose faction-wide improvements, and "Apophis Passage," where the passing of this near-Earth asteroid in 2029 offers the opportunity to mount an expedition for scientific advancements.</li>
<li>Some new projects, including three faction-specific projects for each faction, as well as some that improve Earth-based research. Also consolidated many national independence projects.</li>
<li>An updated tutorial!</li>
<li>UI updates galore, including a new org manager to manage your councilors' orgs all in one place.</li>
<li>Smarter AI on Earth and in space.</li>
<li>Performance improvements, bugfixes, and balance changes across the board. Buffs to particle weapons, hybrid and exotic armor, and earlier access to plasma weapons. Most ship hulls gained a utility slot as batteries became a completely optional module.</li>
<li>10 new achievements! We'll let you discover what they are.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear more about the revised tutorial and UI. In her 2022 write-up, Sin noted that it was often hard to know what to do, and not just because "there's just so much STUFF and so little capacity to pursue 95% of it that it largely becomes background noise." Beyond that, I have a terrible urge to play this but haha haahahaa ahaaa, I'm not going to review it. I can't even dry my towels correctly, let alone get my spies in order. Don't try to make me review Terra Invicta, Julian. I will scream.</p>

            <p>It's been tradition for as long as anyone can remember, that the team at RPS ends the year by choosing their favourite 24 games from the preceding 12 months. In December, we reveal our picks day-by-day. We call this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/advent-calendar">the RPS Advent Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>It's also been tradition that our readers, the inveterate gamblers that they are, bet on what games we're going to pick. Crawling through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">our reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">'What are we all playing this weekend?' posts</a>, and social media ramblings to gain insights to our picks. I swear last night I saw the face of a commenter at my kitchen window, scanning the room for evidence of my choices. Thank goodness, all they saw was evidence of my tightly regimented batchcooking process.</p>
<p>This year will mark the thirteenth year of the RPS Advent Calendar Guessing Game. If it were a child, it could now legally create a social media account and message abuse at the RPS team for including a game in the advent calendar which we didn't review or even write about at any point in the previous 12 months. It's an incredible effort by the event's organiser Aerothorn and a genuine joy to see everyone getting involved.</p>
<p>To take part in the contest, you need to head over to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">the RPS Discord server</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/152113064727150594/1434625053642854433">join the #2025-advent-calendar-guessing-game channel</a>. There you will find a thread where you can submit your guesses. The first post in the channel contains the full rules, but I'll liberally copy and paste the key ones below:</p><p>"On December 1st, Horace will emerge from his den and reveal to us one of the greatest PC games of 2025. He will do this for 24 days, on the final day revealing the Bestest Best game of the year. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict which twenty-four games will be selected.</p>
<p>"In the Entries thread, post a list of the 24 games that you think will feature on the RPS Advent Calendar. Specify which game is Day 24, aka the Bestest Best Game. This is the first tiebreaker. The order of the rest doesn’t matter."</p>
<p>[The second second tiebreaker question is: “How many of the Advent Calendar picks didn't receive a review on RPS?” We're looking for an officially labeled review - not a news story, supporter post, etc."]</p>
<p>"You get a point for every pick that appears on the calendar. At the end of the competition, the person with the most points wins, the second-most is the runner-up, and the third-most is the runner-up runner-up. In the event of a tie, we’ll use the following tiebreakers:</p>
<p>"The individual who correctly guessed the Bestest Best game is the winner.</p>
<p>"If both/neither leaders guessed the Bestest Best game, the person with the closest guess for the second tiebreaker will win.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is still a tie, we’ll have extra prizes for the winners."</p>
<p>What's that? Prizes?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>12 month RPS sub for 1st place</li>
<li>6 month RPS sub for 2nd place</li>
<li>3-month RPS sub for 3rd place</li>
</ul>
<p>Some added details to help you make your picks.</p>
<p>Everyone on the RPS team votes. So this year, that means me, Callum, Edwin, James, Jeremy, Mark, and Ollie. We all privately pick ten games, ordering them from first to last. The game in first place is worth ten points, second place is worth nine, and so on, with tenth place being worth one point. I then add them all to a spreadsheet, add up the totals for each game, and the top 24 games become our advent calendar for that year. (Though, we don't publish them in score order, except for the game revealed on December 24th – that's what we consider to be the Bestest Best game of the year).</p><p>To be eligible for this year's RPS Advent Calendar, a game needs to have been released or received a significant update in the past 12 months. This also means that games which are in early access are in the running. We sometimes pick games from the previous December because we had already closed that year's voting at the point they came out.</p>
<p>This year will be particularly hard to guess as we have seen significant changes in the team. I only joined in October, for instance, and the game I've written most about is Wall World 2 – and not especially positively.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, all the guessers will be in the same boat, and in previous years, the winner has often done it by getting less than 60% of their guesses right.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> is getting another new class, revealed last night as the Hive Scum. They’re a suitably skull-adorned outlaw who can dual-wield guns or shivs, while indulging in a cheeky bit of chemical warfare by homebrewing stimulants and lacing their weapons with harmful chems. Basically the opposite of the space-narc Arbites class added this summer, then: they got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">exploding dogs</a>, the Hive Scum gets exploding drugs.</p>

<p>They’re not joining Darktide’s co-op raids until December 2nd, but in the meantime, developers Fatshark have detailed pretty much all their dirty tricks in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1p0hejn/dev_blog_hive_scum_class_design_talents/">Reddit blog</a>. There’s also this teaser trailer, showing off the akimbo shootering and a new crowbar weapon in CGI action.</p> <figure>

<p>According to the dev blog, the Hive Scum looks to complement the existing roster of melee fiends and ranged specialists by performing as a slippery up-close gunslinger – hence being able to double up on quick-firing but less accurate pistols. They’ve also got a choice of unlockable skills geared around sustaining high-risk, close quarters play, with the option to specialise in either shooting or shanking.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <em>controlled substances</em> element. This covers remixes of existing tools, like the Chem Grenade or Chem Toxin: a stackable damage-over-time effect, similar to the existing burning or bleeding modifiers. But it also extends to an entirely new Stimm Lab mechanic wherein Hive Scummers can, by investing skill points (not unlike the main talent tree), create their own injectable Stimms with customised effects. There’s even a Combat Ability in the main tree that lets nearby teammates share the high, an interaction that I desperately hope will trigger anguished, violently guilt-ridden screams of confusion from the Arbites.</p><p>I may have been slightly underwhelmed, watching that trailer for the first time – 40K is ripe with the likes of ancient cyborgs, Hobbit-sized drunken snipers, and half-goat militiamen, none of whom would turn down a scrap with Chaos and all of whom might have made a more interesting addition to the crew than Florida Woman here. I do like the ferocious sound of the Hive Scum playstyle, though, especially after months of maining the methodical Emprah Cop.</p>
