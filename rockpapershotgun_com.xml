            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players might have managed to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">stop the Illuminate</a> from totally destroying their home planet towards the end of last month, but it still got pretty badly trashed. Enter the game's latest mission - kick off the Super Earth rebuild by securing "reparations".</p>
<p>How are those funds being secured, you ask? This is Helldivers 2, so it's by killing a bunch more baddies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The monumental effort to rebuild Super Earth is underway," confirms <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a> from devs Arrowhead, "A full damage assessment has concluded, exhaustively detailing the incalculable wounds inflicted upon our sovereign homeworld — and their monetary cost, adjusted for inflation."</p>
<p>In order to pay those bills, players have been ordered to secure reparations by enacting some "compulsory asset forfeiture". Basically, they've got to kill 290 million Illuminate enemies and 2.9 billion bugs in just under a week.</p>
<p>Now, these sorts of 'kill a big number of things' orders have often been the most stark showcases of HD2 players' terrifying abilities when it comes to getting stuff done over the past year and a bit. Since they end as soon as the targets are reached, a number of them - especially those that target the squishable Terminid swarms - have ended early.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>MAJOR ORDER: The monumental effort to rebuild Super Earth is underway. </p><p>A full damage assessment has concluded, exhaustively detailing the incalculable wounds inflicted upon our sovereign homeworld—and their monetary cost, adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Pursuant to intergalactic law,… <a href="https://t.co/jpgEwYCOKQ">pic.twitter.com/jpgEwYCOKQ</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1936786795657589149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>This time, though, the sheer size of the bug kill total does look to be presenting a tough challenge thus far. As of writing, the game's <a href="https://helldiverscompanion.com/#overview">unofficial Galactic War tracking apps</a> say 223,303,766 Terminids have been terminated, putting the divers on track to overshoot the deadline of three days or so they've got. On the other hand, things are going great with the Illuminate, with players 41.3% of the way to their goal and looking set to hit it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lho812/new_major_order/">Reddit</a>, there might be a bit of fatigue regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-leans-hard-into-alien-vibes-as-players-fight-to-take-back-freaky-illuminatified-cites">Illuminate major orders</a> setting in at the moment, with some players wishing they'd been sent after the Automatons instead for this mission.</p>
<p>Outside of that live-service grind psychological insight, the interesting thing about this latest mission to me is that, assuming Super Earth does eventually get rebuilt, one would assume another battle for it might be in the cards down the line. It'll probably be a ways away, but I'd be intrigued to see how Arrowhead would go about trying to outdo the first big battle for the planet.</p>
<p>I'd think it'd maybe have to involve a new faction folks have spent less time fighting than the three in the game right now, and some sort of twist on the sequence of fights to hold different mega cities that we got first time around.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll stop speculating before I get to the point oftrying to guess what the second battle for Super Earth's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">commemorative cape</a> might look like.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-post-death-and-destruction-super-earth-rebuild-begins-financed-by-more-death-and-destruction]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> developers at Round8 and Neowiz have received bonuses as a reward for the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Gabbo">Gabbo</a>-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> reaching 3 million cumulative sales across physical and digital on PC and consoles. Cheers, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>As originally reported by South Korean tech site <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/">The Elec</a>, staff have each received a previously arranged 10 million won bonus (about £5400) early, alongside two weeks' paid holiday. This is on top of South Korea's mandatory 15 days paid holiday for employees that have been with a company for more than a year.</p>

<p>Additionally, Round8 developers all got Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. We don't usually report on sales figures at RPS, but reading this made me picture an exhausted combat designer grinning and sipping margaritas in the sun while playing Mario Kart for a fortnight, which I consider an image worth sharing.</p>
<p>To spoon Marmite in the margarita somewhat, this obviously also stood out since stories like this can feel like the exception in a landscape where the reward for working on a successful game can just as often be unemployment, as was the case with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">US-based Marvel Rivals dev back in February</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's at least a few devs at Round8 that would have preferred the money over a console - giving out free Switch 2's feels somewhat like a conscious attempt to generate goodfeels press and pizza-party loyalty. Still, Kudos to Neowiz for being chill cool nice good dudes about it: your reward is one goodfeels press. Lies Of P's Overture DLC got a surprise release earlier this month at Medium Geoff's Bad Shoe Jamboree, which turned out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-alone-in-thinking-lies-of-p-overture-is-a-bit-tough-but-an-update-is-coming-to-smooth-things-over">be surprisingly difficult</a> at that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-free-nintendo-switch-2-two-weeks-paid-holiday-and-a-pile-of-money-for-lies-of-p-devs-after-hitting-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>

            <p>"Experts urge UK households follow tips to beat heatwave, Dread Spider Tide" screech the inter-tabloids. Sparkling pig-grade hogwash, I say. I've recently discovered that the only things you need to defeat the sun are a cheap space heater set to fan mode and a PC overworked to boiling point, the combination of which creates some sort of mysteriously blissful temperature vacuum. Also, I refuse to open my curtains. For those also working on their attractive monitor-glow sallow tan, here are this week's new PC game releases.</p>
<h2>Monday 23rd June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Today sees the release of  real estate roguelike and Balatro for landlords (Bastardlatro? Fix your own latrino?) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546440/Rentlord/">Rentlord</a>. "Maximize rent, while avoiding taxes!", it urges. I'm reverting to default leftist fist shaking here but the one landlord I've ever had was actually a really nice bloke who once took it upon himself to unblock a sink I'd clogged up with rice. Also, he reminded me strongly of Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/">Darktide's Arbites</a> class is also out. Ah, Games Workshop. The company who only take time off from plagiarising Judge Dredd (and Dune, and Moorcock) to sue individual Etsy users for selling dice with ork faces on them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 24th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Tuesday brings tactical RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Shuffle Tactics</a>, which features both nicely minimal pixel sprites and very good fantasy mammals. It's got deckbuilding too, listing both Final Fantasy Tactics and Slay The Spire as inspirations. There's also more Warty Thou in the form of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622820/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__Lex_Imperialis/">Lex Imperialis</a> story expansion for Owlcat's Rogue Trader. It's also got Arbites in it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498060/Nanomon_Virtual_Pet/">Nanomon Virtual Pet</a> looks cute, if you're bored of all the grimdark cyberdogs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 25th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Free walking sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3739210/Condo/">Condo</a> is about exploring an apartment complex in a bout of insomnia and meeting its inhabitants. It's got a slightly noirish, slightly windowless whiskey bar from Yakuza vibe I'm fond of. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597590/Dungeon_Mori/">Dungeon Mori</a> is a fetching crawler, although perhaps not fetching enough to overcome my inherent racism against fantasy catgirls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 26th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> headlines Thursday. That's the great uncle of immersive sims and Kenny Lemsip's precursor to Bioshock. Immersive sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/">Project Silverfish</a> releases in early access. More importantly, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3808460/Bird_Game/">Bird Game</a>. If you dislike birds and/or games, you can "explore a museum containing the word's greatest collection of toilet art" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3781500/La_Galerie_des_Toilettes/">La Galerie des Toilettes</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 27th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Friday has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1861250/Antro/">Antro</a> inside of it - a rhythmic 2.5d platformer from Barcelona where you're a courier who's also out to overthrow a totalitarian regime. There's also "Untitled Shoes Game" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Bambas</a>. Good one, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bambas-is-untitled-shoes-game">Edwin</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This week the Treehouse is mostly melting. Not me though. I am a very good temperature. Let me know if I've missed any good'uns.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-system-shock-2-remastered-multiple-warhammer-40000-dogs-and-an-unexpected-continuation-of-toilet-theming]]></content:encoded>
