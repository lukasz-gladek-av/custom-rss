            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s warp pack sounded like great fun as soon as it was announced as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">last month's Control Group warbond</a>, and it's warped its way into many players' hearts. This is thanks in part to some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m9oto2/why_the_warp_pack_is_stier_and_plus_some_cool/">cool tricks</a> and glitches you can use it to pull off, with the game's latest patch having seen Arrowhead opt to outlaw the cheekiest of these.</p>
<p>You see, for the uninitiated, each mission in the shooter kicks off with you descending onto a planet and therefore ends with you being extracted via shuttle back up to your ship. It's the circle of Helldiver life and it moves us all. Well aside from folks who'd taken to using a well-timed warp to escape their ride home as it took off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, as you can see below, it's not as if this would leave perpetrators facing the consequences they should have. Instead of being marooned forever near the likes of Crimsican city Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch two (yes, that's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1m6s4uq/if_you_thought_gun_was_a_silly_mega_city_name/">real location in Helldivers 2</a>, and yes, it's named after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxO0UdpoxM">infamous Welsh town</a>), the mission just ends as normal and you're magically beamed up, Scotty.</p>
<p>Enter patch 01.003.202, the full notes for which you canm find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516342955916658905?l=english">here</a>. "Disabled LIFT-182 warp pack fields around shuttles, preventing any Helldiver escapees," reads one of those notes. "You are done, it is time to go home." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi480s/well_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/">Awwwwwwwww</a>, say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi4b5t/this_has_got_to_be_the_best_thing_ah_has_added_to/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1mi50yw/patch_01003202/">players</a>, and I'd join in if pulling off the glitch didn't come with any potential to muck things up for other players.

</span></p><p>Outside of that, the patch is mostly minor bug fixes and tweaks, with a lot sticking to the theme of ensuring stuff from the Control Group warbond works as planned. For example, Arrowhead have decreased the Epoch plasma cannon's spread by 75% in an effort to improve its accuracy, made sure the laser sentry displays heat build up properly, and a couple of less flashy corrections to the warp pack on top of the extraction one.</p>
<p>There's also a fix for the manic laughter emote not triggering sound when done on a ship, because in space people apparently should be able to hear you creepily giggling.</p>
<p>That's it for now, but with players keen for a lot more fixes amid what's understandably been a relatively quiet summer for Arrowhead, studio CEO Shams Jorjani's suggested via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1402298082757971968">the game's Discord</a> that they're writing up a blog post that'll outline how they're prioritising which bugs get fixed first. The exec says there's "a very complex answer", so hopefully that rubric'll help the two sides of the coin be on the same page, especially since communication <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-arrowhead-addresses-escalation-of-freedom-update-backlash-60-day-plan">hasn't always been Arrowhead's strong suit</a> over the past year and a bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-patch-puts-a-stop-to-the-warp-packs-cheekiest-party-trick-because-you-are-done-it-is-time-to-go-home]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A brace of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> reporting has treated us to the first details of the game's combat system. Here are the headlines: counter attacks, weapon degradation and an energy bar that lets you perform power moves and dodge in slow motion. It's apparently reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> in that you have a stamina system and the dodge and counter timing can be tricky - a summary I would say also describes Punch-Out! from 1984, if I wanted to be a snarky little shitlord. There are no guns, just melee weapons that range from scavenged baseball bats to naginata polearms, looted from a spirit world of shrines and masked figures. </p><!--more-->
<p>Lob a naginata into an online gaming forum roundabouts now, and there's a one in six chance you'll seriously injure somebody who's miffed about all this. It's possible, mind, that they are miffed because some previewer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">innocently suggested that Soulslikes might be an influence</a> (the devs haven't spelled this out, as far as I know) and this fleeting observation has been internet-telephoned into the argument that Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> with schoolgirls. But also, they will be miffed because resenting Silent Hill's combat is integral to enjoying Silent Hill. It is the Silent Hillite's most treasured pastime.</p>
<p>I've held forth in the past about why the series absolutely doesn't need a combat system, and why any and all efforts to "improve" it with more complex mechanics are akin to putting wing mirrors on Pyramid Head. Lately, though, I've found peace in the idea that Silent Hill needing a combat system is Silent Hill's original curse. That need will always haunt the town's hospitals and schools - the ghost of a 'real' action game, tethered to this plane by the whims of commerce, trying to make sense of itself in a story about unschooled protagonists and squishy manifestations of self-loathing, doomed forever to be an uncertain mixture of pretty bad or fine but out-of-place.</p>
<p>It's not like Silent Hill f developers Neobards are breaking terrifying new ground for the series: Silent Hill 4 had weapon degradation already. The strangest aspect of the combat is a special move gauge that's tethered, Amnesia-style, to your character's mental wellbeing. The more spooked she is, the less slow-mo power attack juice she'll have at her disposal. This could be either a bruisingly artificial or clever way of raising the stakes during boss battles. Anyway, I remain more fascinated by the setting and story, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">read about here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A stickfellow in a top hat's just burst through a twentieth story window, taking a fatal tumble down the corporate ladder, and all because I lobbed a parcel at him. This kind of thing happens all the time in Stick It to the Stickman, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">beat ’em up</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> devs Free Lives are set to release in early access form later this month.</p>
<p>It's glorious enough to forgive any frustration you might have been left with when publishers Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">announced late last year</a> that the corporate slapfest had been delayed into 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can probably make out from the trailer below, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2085540/Stick_It_to_the_Stickman/">Stick It to the Stickman</a>'s premise is cathartically simple: "Stickmen need jobs, but more importantly, shareholders need growth. Climb to the top of the tower to crush your boss's nuts, and please note that 50% of office work is kicking stickmen out of windows." Once you brawl your way to the roof of the office in simply cathartic fashion, you fight the existing CEO for the honour of leading the corporate megastructure, and the power to choose between spitting in the face of or bowing before the cabalistic corpoverlords which rule all.</p>
<p>The game's finally set to come out in early access form on August 18, but you can get a taste of its floppy fisticuffs by giving a freshly-revamped Steam demo a go. I have, and as my first exposure to sticking a fleshy wrench in the gears of capitalism, it gets a big thumbs up.</p>

<p>You start off sitting on a park bench, then beat your way through a throng of job applicants gathered around the lobby of a skyscraper. Naturally, you're asked to provide a reference in the form of the name of a friend who already works at the firm. Once you're hired, your first task is to beat this old friend and Fortnite buddy senseless via slapstick scuffle. Then, it's off up the tower, climbing ladders and entering lifts that sound suspiciously like toilets flushing to reach ever new levels of suited sticks in need of dragon punching, spin kicking, or just having a coffee mug lobbed at their bonce.</p>
<p>Free Lives seem to have gotten the mix of hilarious body floatiness once a stickperson gets smacked and the weighty punch you want inflicting such a blow to have pretty close to the sweet spot. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>, the cartoony physicality's top notch. The jokes about capitalism are pretty damn funny to boot.</p>
<p>The devs are aiming to have Stick It to the Stickman's early access last for "approximately 12 months", with fresh additions being made each month. "We plan on expanding the corporation to include manufacturing, marketing, a science center and a doomsday bunker, as well as corporate lobbying," they write. "Each new job within the game will have unique gameplay. And each new job will take the player one step closer to the final chapter of the story."</p>
<p>I'm pretty hooked on booting execs out of windows thanks to the demo, so this is definitely on my radar going forward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unleash-blunt-force-castration-on-execs-when-stick-it-to-the-stickman-finally-launches-in-early-access-this-month]]></content:encoded>
