            <p>The Maw has once again eaten Edwin. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">After spending a few days in the news beast's digestive tract back in October</a>, Edwin did implement fresh safety protocols. No petting The Maw. Only feed The Maw using a standard issue six foot news pole. All teeth cleaning must be performed by a qualified animal dentist with a certificate in eldritch care. Sadly, the CCTV camera shows Edwin was fooled by The Maw's gurgles, which sounded suspiciously like 'Can I tell you a secret?'. Edwin proffered his ear, and the cost of his curiosity was to be swallowed whole. We believe he will climb out of the creature's gullet in time to cover The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the proper traditions were observed. Mark played The Last Post on his kazoo, James wiped out the '56' on the 'Days since last accident' whiteboard in the coffee room, and wrote in a '0'. There was a respectful silence, only interrupted by the microwave ping when my porridge was done.</p>
<p>Things should be quietening down as we approach Christmas. That said, there are still some great games on the docket this week.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a> sees you trying to earn your freedom from the Underworld by skating all the way to the moon. The main issue is you're made of glass, any slips on the way are mighty deadly.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a> is the fleshed out and expanded version of the prequel to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios infamous Yakuza series. First released on PC in 2018, this embiggened version includes a Red Light Raid multiplayer mode.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597880/Cat_Named_Mojave/">Cat Named Mojave</a> is ideal for anyone who spent last week playing Horses and decided they need a touch more animal-headed, human-bodied horror in their lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3604260/Liminal_City/">Liminal City</a> is for people who played Horses and thought, I would like a nice horror game with no people in at all, please-and-thank-you. (Spider-like creatures that chase you through car parks are, however, in attendance.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">Death Howl</a> is leaning hard into its deck-building, soulslike genre blending, even putting <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2825880/extras/3133a8ee09c772e865609fe30bbd0a99.avif?t=1765188528">a chart on its Steam Page</a> detailing how it satisfies the criteria of both. Buzz words aside, it looks to be a stylish descent into a wasteland filled with eldritch horrors.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582980/Milanos_Odd_Job_Collection/">Milano's Odd Job Collection</a> is the localised release of Milano no Arubaito, first released in Japan in 1999. If you ever wanted to recreate the experience of childhood labour exploitation, you can earn summer money as a 11-year-old Milano as she steps into the shoes of a fruit picker, nurse, and delivery driver.</li>
<li>Set in a world where music is outlawed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is a rhythm action game where you put on illegal gigs and smash the state. We'll have a review later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350190/Anxiety_Puppy/">Anxiety Puppy</a> is a visual novel about dealing with the mounting daily anxieties of living in a city. I'm not sure about the developers' claim that this is a unique theme in gaming, but I'm all for people looking for ways to represent mental health.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">Ashes of Creation</a> will be opening its MMO world up to early access players this week. The developers are stressing that it will be an alpha world and expect frequent, significant changes to its world. Still, with the ambition to create a world where you can trade, capture, or defend player-developed settlements, it could be a good game to explore in its early days.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>In an appropriate disregard for canonical history, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718460/Terminator_2D_NO_FATE/">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is a pixel-art game set in and around the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day which ignores the 8-bit movie tie-in game released on the NES and Master System in 1992. Still, 90s game never came to PC, so it may as well not exist – as much fun as riding a motorbike through the LA canals and shooting locks off chainlink gates may have been. The new game recreates scenes from the film and invents new events that took place in the margins of the action. It's basically the Terminator equivalent of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>
<p>While this is a comparatively quiet week for releases. If you're a news glutton similar to our fine Maw, look forward to a veritable feast of stories from tomorrow's Wholesome Snack and Thursday night's Game Awards.</p>

            <p>Long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a> director, producer, and general advocate for the virtual graps Katsuhiro Harada has announced he's leaving Bandai Nanco at the close of 2025. Harada's opted to step away as the fighting series turns 30, though he does have one more guest appearance at the Tekken World Tour finals lined up early next year. He's also released an hour-long DJ mix on Soundcloud to commemorate the occasion, making up for the fact he never got around to DJing live at a Tekken tournament.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," the developer announced on Twitter.</p>
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect," he added "Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator'. During that period, I sought advice from [former Sony Computer Entertainment CEO] Ken Kutaragi — whom I respect as though he were another father — and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><p>My roots lie…</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Harada added that he's spent the past five years or so gradually handing over all of his responsibilities, as well as custodianship of Tekken's stories and world, to the rest of Bandai's Tekken team.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">put out a statement</a> on behalf of Tekken 8's developers, thanking Harada and assuring players "that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8." "We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide," that statement continues.</p><p>Heading back to Harada's goodbye post, the veteran developer wrote that he'll share more info about his next steps "at a later date". For now, he left things off by sharing an hour-long DJ mix he's created and popped on Soundcloud. "For 30 years I kept saying, 'I’ll do it someday,' and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event," the dev explained. "So instead, I will be releasing — for the first and last time — a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement. Listening to it brings back many memories."</p>
<p>You can give the DJ mix, dubbed 'TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix' <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix">here</a>. I can confirm the first five minutes are very funky.</p>

            <p>Open your mouth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>. Ah, it's as I suspected, you've eaten the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>! Don't worry, I don't blame you. You were only hungry, and the modders controlling your great maw were keen to see how Melinoë would cope with taking on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> run through the underworld which Zagreus blazes through in the first game.</p>

<p>Fittingly, then, the mod (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/theres-a-mod-that-lets-you-play-hades-1-in-hades-2/">Poseidon Chronos Gamer</a>) which adds that underworld run path to Hades 2 is called Zagreus Journey. With it installed, Melinoë'll be able to head through a chaos manhole out of the crossroads located between the two doors leading to her usual paths. Jumping into this new exit sees the princess of the underworld emerge in Tartarus, then fight through Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx, battling all the same enemies Zag once did. Naturally, though, this time you'll be slapping them up with Mel's abilities and Hades 2's selection of boons.</p>
<p>Zagreus doesn't feature in combat, but he does pop in to handle all of the dialogue, delivering lines from the first game while Melinoë stands silently by his side. Get all the way to the end, and you'll get to see how the talents Mel's honed battling the time bloke and those besieging Olympus stack up against her dear old dad, Hades.</p><p>The modder behind this splicing of two mythical smitings, Nikkel Mollenhauer, writes in its description that they do have plans to add in some new story beats and dialogue between Melinoë and other Hades 2 characters about the new route at some point down the line. That'll serve as a fresh epilogue of sorts, since the modder reccomends you wait until you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-post-launch-patch-1-revamps-melinoes-true-ending-and-is-out-now-in-steam-preview-form">the game's true ending</a> before taking the underworld plunge. Fresh incantations that'll enable meta-progression on the new route, erebus gates, and extra boons are also on their future to-do list, as well as getting the original Hades' secret boss fight up and running.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving their work a go, you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes?tab=readme-ov-file">Github</a> or <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/">Thunderstore</a>. You'll need to zap all of your other current Hades 2 mods to get it working, as well as make sure you've got both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">Hades 2</a> and the original Hades installed in a place the mod can find them.</p>
