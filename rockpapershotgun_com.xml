I have yet to play Oxygen Not Included, but Klei seldom miss - their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a> remains one of my favouritest ninja shankfests - and Away Team already seems very appealing for putting a deeply inhumane emphasis on traitorous physics.

<p>In offering a world in which "every tile is simulated", Away Team is both daring comparisons with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> and building on the volatile foundations of Oxygen Not Included, which Nate (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oxygen-not-included-review">called</a> "a machine for procedurally generating engineering problems, and due to the huge number of physical properties interacting in the simulation, they will never be the same twice".</p>
<p>In Away Team, you are a solitary Oxygen Not Included colonist, aka Duplicant, who has mistakenly pushed a big red button and rocketed off to a strange new world. Equipped with a vacuum gun, you must explore the depths and craft your own abode from all the materials you find. You will need food and oxygen. Also, a working understanding of conductivity. And a very careful aim.</p>
<p>This is a realm in which every piece of matter is subject to the laws of thermodynamics. Liquids flow and evaporate. Fires spread, given access to flammable materials. I don't remember things being so... temperamental in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> away missions, but I would have happily watched a million episodes of a show in which Captain Picard spends 29 minutes gingerly carving out acid vats, then says "oh shit" just before the credits roll.</p>
<p>Away Team has yet no release date, but it does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168390/Away_Team/">a Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Death, taxes, and CD Projekt finding ways to make its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">massive RPGs</a> come with graphical options that'll have your computer kicking out enough heat to turn the arctic circle into the Arizona desert. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> sounds set to continue that trend, even if its devs have opted to go "more-console first" when putting it together.</p>
<p>Folks from the studio and Epic revealed this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q&amp;t=253s">a chat</a> with the beloved boffins over at Digital Foundry. As you'd expect, it's a long discussion that delves into all things hardware-related when it comes to TW4's recent tech demo. You know, the one that included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-fans-reckon-the-witcher-4-tech-demo-featured-familiar-voice-from-the-witcher-3-interesting-extra-wrinkle">familiar voices</a> and exposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">horse muscles</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Charles Tremblay, CD Projekt's VP of technology said when asked why the tech demo was on PS5. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to see, ok, this time around we really want to be [doing] more console-first development, right? We worked with Unreal, with our partner, and then we saw the challenge. To realise the ambition, to make what we want at 60 fps on PS5 would be, you know, there would be work."</p>
<p>So, the studio's made The Witcher 4's console performance a big focus - something that's not surprising given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch issues generally proved much more dire on those platforms than on PC. That's not to say we were spared totally, I remember some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-review">pretty wacky glitches</a> from the start of my first playthrough, but nothing so game-breaking it made me consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-removed-cyberpunk-2077-from-the-playstation-store">trying to get a refund</a>.</p>
<p>However, don't fret, CD Projekt still plan on letting you take full advantage of the bells and whistles the best PCs can pull off, even if it sounds like they're currently figuring out exactly what that'll entail.</p>
<p>"It's easier to scale up than down, because we know that both Lumen (UE5's global illumination and reflections system) and all those technologies are providing us pretty consistent representation across the scale up, we know that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there's room to scale up," CD Projekt VP and global art director Jakub Knapik said in a bit of the chat about the game's graphical potential beyond what the PS5 can handle.</p>
<p>He added that CD Projekt aim to "expand all the raytracing features forwards" on PC, and in general ensure that people who spend the big bucks on their desktops are appropriately rewarded with the likes of uber-swankily rendered huts and suitably stunning vistas.</p>
<p>"In the past, something that's [been] super important for the group is that if people pay good money for the hardware, we want them to have what the game can provide for that [top hardware], not like a simplified experience," Tremblay added, "So this is something we'll definitely explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">finally come to their senses</a> and rolled back a lot of the unpopular PC region locking that's been stopping folks in various parts of the world enjoying a bunch of games. It looks like one of those titles, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, could finally be getting a cape players have craved for a year or so as a result.</p>
<p>Yep, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has teased deploying the review bomb-themed cape that first emerged as a meme following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">the backlash</a> to PlayStation attempting to change the game's PSN account linking rules last year. We've known the cape was a real item the studio had made for a while now, but with the region locking still ongoing, Arrowhead have opted to keep it locked away for months on end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1383206162622582866">Helldivers 2's Discord server</a> not long after a mass removal of countries from the restricted lists of several PlayStation-affiliated PC games was spotted on June 13th, Jorjani wrote: "It was all our good friends at PlayStation".</p>
<p>He went on to ask players to consider revisiting any negative reviews of the game left solely because of the region locking controversy, writing: "It would be nice if folks would change their review as a result of this. But it’s not a must if you don’t wanna. It’s a point of pride for the team to see their hard work recognized with a higher user review score." Glancing at Steam, it looks like a good number have done just that over the weekend.</p>

<p>Naturally, that got folks wondering whether they might soon be getting the review bomb cape, with Jorjani responding to a question about it: "I’ll talk to the team next week. But we always felt it was something to give away once regions returned. PS has been working hard on this so a cape to celebrate is in order."</p>
<p>So, a garment that features the section of Steam's reviews graph showing just how many folks were taking out their PSN account linking frustrations on Helldivers 2 last May sounds like it could finally be incoming. If you're wondering why this is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i7s3zc/what_ever_happened_to_the_review_bomb_cape_they/">thing people would want</a>, my best answer is that the Helldivers 2 community loves a good in-joke, so <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">came up with designs</a> for the cape, then started properly campaigning for it become a real thing once Arrowhead acknowledged these sketches.</p>
<p>If you're curious as to what it'd look like, here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt tweeted out just over 13 months ago, later confirming that the studio was just waiting for the right time to release it - basically, once the region locking controversy was actually over. Assuming it does finally arrive, it'll definitely be a fitting way to commemorate a long overdue change.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(Actual announcement post follows.)
</p>
<p>
Hello all! You may have noticed that we’ve stopped doing the weekly Maw liveblogs. Instead, we’ve been doing a round-up of new PC game releases with subheadings and a standard-issue comments thread. 
</p>
<p>
The reasons for this are fairly simple and boring. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/introducing-the-maw-your-weekly-rps-news-liveblog">When I came up with the Maw liveblog concept</a>, I envisaged it as a big old melting pot of open-air news planning tool, forum thread, reader tips thread and scraps drawer. It was quite an open-ended concept, one that sort of needed a whole site built around it, and I’ve struggled to figure out aspects of the execution – for example, how it should work alongside our private Trello board, where we list embargoed stories. 
</p>
<p>
Really, though, the issue here is time and turnover. A lot of people have left RPS in the nearly two years since I joined, which naturally means there’s less scope for anything that isn’t bread-and-butter news, reviews and features. Our current liveblog tech isn’t really suited to my original goals for the Maw – it lacks full comments functionality, for example – and Gamer Network’s hardworking tech team aren’t in a position to make any upgrades anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The Maw itself will always plague us. Its hunger is, after all, insatiable, and its reach is beyond measure. The world is the Maw and the Maw is the world. The liveblog may yet return, given a change of circumstances. In the meantime, it is my frail hope that our Monday rounds-up articles, newly bolstered by the latest in h2 tags and futuristic comments-threading, will be enough to blunt the creature’s appetite and buy our newswranglers a precious few hours in which to carve some headlines from the firmament. Once more with feeling, FEED THE MAW.

This will be the first showcase of its type they've done, and it's billed to feature announcements for "new games" in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. That's more than one, as the discerning pluralisation understanders among you have no doubt sagely clocked.</p>

<p>"Whether you’re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy," writes CA's Roger Collum. "Warhammer 40K and Medieval 3!" The crowds bay in frothing anticipation. "Star Wars and World War 1!", we scream like shrill goats perched on single planks of driftwood floating upon stone-gray oceans, kept from madness only by the knowledge that we can adequately explain what a hammer and anvil maneuver is, in lieu of having formed any meaningful human relationships in a decade.</p>
<p>"Lord Of The Rings and Empire 2!", reads the scrawled note sellotaped to the goat-rescuing submariner's periscope lens, resulting in the tragic water deaths of both the goat and then the entire crew somehow. This madness has gone too far. Please, control yourselves.</p>
<p>For what it's worth: yes, I think at least one of these games is going to be Warhammer 40,000. On to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">hefty pile of circumstantial evidence</a>, you can add the seeming absence of Warhammer 3 game director Rich Aldridge from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">latest Tides Of Torment showcase</a>. This said, it's also equally possible Aldridge is hard at work on the massive End Times expansion I'm sure is coming to Twarhammer sooner rather than later. "Tides of Torment DLC will reveal its final playable faction in July," writes Collum, "and some long-awaited content will be unveiled at the anniversary showcase". As long as I get Thanquol before the trilogy wraps up, I'm a happy little ratman. Well, Thanquol <a href="https://youtu.be/iUwsmt4DlUM">and Toddy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Monday 16th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are you old enough to remember GEX? My sympathies. There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gex-trilogy">GEX trilogy</a> remaster out today. If you are not old enough to remember GEX, perhaps you will be more enraptured by cute co-op climbing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>. I also have my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">Nightmare Frontier</a>, a sort of weird western XCOM, with the caveat that AI generation tools were used to created some of its menu assets and translate the script.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's time to date everything in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Date Everything!</a> and take back Control of the office in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC Firebreak</a>. There's also post-apocalyptic colony builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, elven real-time tactics game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wartorn">Wartorn</a>, and shonen mech RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525510/NITRO_GEN_OMEGA/">Nitro Gen Omega</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>In first-person actioner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blessed-burden">Blessed Burden</a> you are the last surviving priest journeying deep into the bowels of hell, or thereabouts.

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/">Broken Arrow</a> is not a 90s airplane movie but a real-time strategy game set in the Baltic states with over 300 units. Pretty much the polar opposite of pixelart escapade <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425180/Vessels_of_Decay/">Vessels Of Decay</a>, in which you navigate a post-apocalyptic Scandinavia full of folkoric monsters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can think of no better way to spend Friday than by tending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mushroom-musume">an eerie mushroom princess</a>. Unless it be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">sabotaging gravity as a witch</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the treehouse up to this week? Brendan and Jeremy are deep in the desert, Nic is roving an open world with a block of tofu, James appears moderately excited about a TV of some kind, Mark is reopening the gates of Oblivion, Graham is sitting on a large throne made of bones, and Ollie continues to reign over the night. How about you?</p>
