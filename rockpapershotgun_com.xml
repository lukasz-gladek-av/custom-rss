            <p>Ubisoft are delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, but this time, not just out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">concern about the quality of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow. </p><!--more-->
<p>Quite what this means is open to speculation, but it was recently rumoured that Ubi's First Family the Guillemot brothers have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">conspiring with Tencent to buy the company out</a>, while minority shareholders displeased by the company's falling share price have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">clamouring</a> for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to a strategic investor". So this could be Big. Bigger than a single video game's delay, anyway.</p>
<p>"Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation," reads a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf">"strategic update" from Ubisoft</a>, posted this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft announced today that it has appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders," it continues. "This process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materializes."</p><p>Ubisoft have been somewhat up the creek financially for a while, losing almost half their share value in 2024, partly due to the "soft" performance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. As such they've been cutting back. In December, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">discontinued PvP shooter XDefiant and laid off around 277 people</a>. According to today's statement, shuttering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> involved the closure of "three production studios in high-cost geographies" - as in, regions where wages are higher.</p>
<p>The company "will continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a highly selective approach to investments", the statement goes on. Ubisoft now expect to reduce their "fixed cost base" (in other words, costs that consist of more predictable, recurring business expenses, like employee salaries) by â‚¬200 million for the fiscal year 2025-2026, compared to 2022-2023 on an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualize.asp">annualised</a> basis.</p>
<p>And then there's the delaying of Shadows, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">moderately promising historical opus</a> which appears to have far too much riding on it in the wake of Outlaws.</p>
<p>"Additionally, as part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences, it has been decided to provide an additional month of development to Assassin's Creed Shadows," Ubisoft write. "This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community. The game is now scheduled for March 20."</p><p>I do not have the insight to play soothsayer about Ubisoft's fortunes here. I will end instead by pointing you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">this bracingly weary Alice0 (RPS in peace) article from 2022</a>, in which CEO Yves Guillemot talks up Ubisoft's independence while also stating that, of course, they'd happily sell the farm to anybody with a really, really large amount of money.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.</p><!--more-->

<p>As the name suggests, Beyond Citadel is a sequel to The Citadel, which launched in 2020. It's the work of Japanese developer doekuramori, who I'm not familiar with. The premise: it is Armageddon O' Clock. You are the Martyr, gun-toting anime girl agent of seven guardian angels. Your task is to "cancel the apocalypse" by defeating the forces of the rapacious Trumpeters, and unearthing the buried secrets of humankind's final stronghold.</p>
<p>"Cancel the apocalypse" is seemingly a reference to Pacific Rim, but I have yet to meet Idris Elba in Beyond Citadel. His agent probably wouldn't let him anywhere near a hot potato like this. In any case, the more appropriate parallel here is surely Neon Genesis Evangelion, with its hyper-depressive Biblical imagery and penchant for grotesquely magnified bodily suffering.</p><p>Based on the Steam demo, the world is a mixture of rolling, external wastelands and square, multiple-elevation corridors and chambers where you'll play find-the-keycard, and also disembowel-the-demon. The gunplay is broadly Doom-to-Dark-Forces, but with corner-peeking and ironsight aiming. You also get options to make the handling more elaborate. You can turn on weapon deterioration, which might cause guns to jam, and there's a manual reload feature where you have to cock the firearm after feeding in shells. I love this latter system: it makes life harder, of course, but it creates a satisfying tempo and makes the combat feel more intricate and tactile. I like when video game guns go clicky-clack, perhaps even more than when they go boom.</p>
<p>I also like the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucah-born-of-a-dream">Lucah: Born Of A Dream</a> and its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a>. It's a universe of dense runes, gangrene-daubed monoliths, and hollow-eyed anime people slumped in attitudes of foreboding and despair. The menus and intermission screens consist of drawings of additional, hollow-eyed anime people, all of them huddled up gripping battleaxes and rifles while showing a lot of thigh.</p>
<p>There is plenty to read, with in-game writing that ranges from clipped computer logs to snippets of scripture. The English localisation is a bit scruffy, but it doesn't seem any more obscure than it intends to be. God is dead, I gather. "0-919 activation in process". Truth lies below.</p>

<p>I'm always keen on video games that involve a relentless descent through layers of mounting unearthliness, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>. In this case, looking down a shaft to the next area also means gazing directly into your character's pixelart cleavage. Which doesn't feel like an accident, on the developer's part. I suspect there's something more thoughtful to say about the relationship between the game's themes and its borderline-absurdist nudity and gore, perhaps touching on the ethereal, alien symbology of anime girls in general, but I'm not sure I'm the best writer for the job.</p>
<p>Still, I like Beyond Citadel's gunplay and spaces enough that I'll probably play a little more. I'll let you know if it proves worth the journey, but if you're convinced already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371240/Beyond_Citadel/">you can buy it on Steam right now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
