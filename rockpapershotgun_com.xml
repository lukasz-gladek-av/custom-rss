            <p>New York's Strong National Museum of Play has welcomed four new entries into its Video Game Hall Of Fame: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, Goldeneye, 1981's arcade side-scroller Defender, and the virtual pet Tamagotchi. It's that last one that's by far the most interesting of the four picks, and I must admit, I'd never actually thought about Tamagotchi in these exact terms before.</p>

<p>Here's The Strong on Tamagotchi's inclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond cultivating nostalgia, Tamagotchi offered a distinct form of play apart from the prevailing popularity of video game electronics at the time. In the book Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination (2006), scholar Anne Allison argued that Tamagotchi provided young users with feelings of connection, intimacy, and personalization, a respite from competition and fighting games."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is purely speculative on my part - I'd love for someone to give me a little more context or insight - but the first Tamagotchi was released in 1996, the same year as SNES farming game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> influence Harvest Moon and the original Pokémon. Taken together, that's an incredibly influential year for contemporary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">non violent</a> or "cosy" titles, and I do wonder if these three games (or two games and Tamagotchi, depending on your view) themselves share common influences.</p>
<p>When I say I'd never thought of Tamagotchi as a videogame, I don't mean it in "not a real game sense", either. Just that it hadn't actually occurred to me to think about in what we might broadly call videogame canon or history. But I came around the idea pretty quickly, honestly. Now I think about, Tamagotchi might actually have been my first exposure to permadeath. I once lost one for months, eventually finding it under my bed to behold my beloved pet dying in a mountain of its own shit. Brutal stuff.</p>
<p>As for Quake's inclusion, The Strong focuses on its use of 3D space, as well as the popularity of its competitive multiplayer "central to the creation of esports as an industry". It was also, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/quake/">they point out</a>, "the first shooter to get widespread mod support", spawning the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<p>These four additions bring the hall of fame's total up to 49 games. The earliest entry is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spacewar">Spacewar!</a>, and the most recent is The Last Of Us. We like to complain about irritating uses of punctuation in game names here at RPS but I suppose they've been with us since the beginning. I'm now wishing they'd named The Last Of Us something like Panic! At The Abandoned Supermarket just for the sake of symmetry.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Grand strategy country crusher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-grand-strategy-game-from-paradox-is-europa-universalis-5">announced yesterday</a>, revealing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">complex century-spanning historical sim</a>. But one thing we still don't know is the price or how it'll be sold. If you want to buy the previous game in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis 4</a>, you'll find a slew of subscription models and a big library of DLC alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">the base game</a>. Which might cause some fans to worry that the sequel will launch with some sort of similar subscription model. But this won't be the case, say developers Paradox Tinto. They're going to sell it normally. At least for now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, when we have enough DLCs there will be subscription models, because subscription models are great," said game director Johan Andersson in an interview with RPS. But when asked if the publisher was planning to have a subscription model straight out of the gate, he said no.</p>
<p>"No, unless we have DLC. I mean, of course, I would love to have a subscription model where people paid me five euros a month, or ten euros, whatever. But unless we actually have any content, I'm not sure people want [to be told]: 'Hey! Pay ten euros now for January, February, March... and in April you'll get DLC!' No."</p>
<p>Paradox started experimenting with subscriptions to their biggest and most expandofied games like EU4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-experimenting-with-a-subscription-service-to-play-europa-universalis-iv-and-its-dlc">back in 2020</a>, and later offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellaris-launches-expansion-subscription-offering-access-to-all-dlc-for-850-per-month">a subscription to all Stellaris's space stuff</a> in 2024. It costs £8.50 a month and you don't get to keep anything when you unsubscribe. You can still buy each of these games normally, of course. The sub is just an option - one I don't really recommend. It certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense for the publisher's latest grand strategy sequel at launch, and the devs agree. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But there is another familiar problem for Paradox. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> 5 will be sized up next to its predecessor. How can the new strategy game compete with a decade of DLCs and extras? Will there be enough in the base game of Europa Universalis 5 to entice veterans to hop over to the new game? Andersson thinks so. </p>
<p>"Almost all of the EU4 features that are in its DLCs right now are part of the base game in EU5," he told us. This means EU5 will inherit all of the systems that EU4 has built up over years of expansions and updates. Which theoretically gives it as much value as the entire catalogue of EU4 expansions. Of course, players will be able to verify that promise once EU5 is fully released.</p>
<p>As for DLC plans, Paradox Tinto are not worrying about that just yet, says Andersson. </p>
<p>"We have visions," says Andersson, "but I think it's a bad idea to write ideas and work on things... before you have wrapped up and shipped the game. That's my experience. Of course, salespeople want [to say]: 'we need to have 12 DLCs ready ASAP!' But, yeah... I don't want to do it because it takes away from the base game."</p>
<p>That's quite refreshing and reassuring to hear. Paradox are sometimes accused of milking it when it comes to their many cosmetic packs and expandobits. They have even been accused of "fixing" games with paid DLC - something the company's CEO refuted by comparing their process of making games to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">painting a piece of art</a>. "When is a painting done?" he mused. "When you stop painting it, I guess."</p>
<p>My own view is that Paradox DLC is always, by its nature, going to be hit or miss. And you can easily dodge the duff stuff by reading up on reviews. It's the best way to tell what's a thin soup of hats and what is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">rich stew of adventure</a>. You don't need a subscription model when you've got Rock Paper Shotgun, is what I'm saying, friend. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the 21st best-selling game of all time? It's sold more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>! At least by the numbers we currently have, anyway. I don't care all that much about sales figures, but if creator Eric Barone cared more about money, I can only imagine that a sequel would be all but guaranteed. As it turns out though, the developer could actually see himself making a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Barone recently appeared on the podcast Tiger Belly (thanks, GamesRadar), where host Bobby Lee asked why he doesn't just make a Stardew Valley 2 when he's constantly releasing new updates. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone explains. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas."
</p>

<p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83DYlsJoaFk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
He noted that a lot of these ideas come about from playing the game himself and thinking, "'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way than to make a whole new game."
</p>
<p>
And then came the comment that struck fear into my heart: "I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest." I say fear, because Barone struggles to not update the original game, so much so he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-stardew-valley-is-finally-done-but-the-dev-behind-it-is-committed-to-not-working-on-it-until-haunted-chocolatier-is-done">somewhat forcing himself to stop working on it so he can actually finish Haunted Chocolatier</a>. However, Barone did also say that while he won't deny the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2, he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy, that's why I'm making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>."
</p>
<p>
So, really we've got a Schrodinger's Stardew Valley sequel here. Fingers crossed Barone doesn't get carried away and do it, I'd like to play Haunted Chocolatier before I retire.

            <p>
I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doloc-town">Doloc Town</a> is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of Steam games, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/">launch discount on Steam</a> too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.
