            <p>Roblox will roll out selfie-based "facial age estimation technology" as a mandatory requirement for all of its players, as part of efforts to "limit communications" between minors and adults they don't know.</p>
<p>The corporation behind the massive game filled with smaller games, many of which are made by young people, say they aim to bring in this measure by the end of 2025. The news is part of a "long-term" vision for child safety in the wake of the US state of Louisiana's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144">lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a>, with Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman wrote in <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">an announcement</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-to-begin-using-facial-age-estimation-technology-on-its-users-promises-to-limit-communication-between-adults-and-minors-unless-they-know-each-other-in-the-real-world/">PC Gamer</a> that this age estimation tech will be deployed to everyone who uses the game's built-in communications systems, and will work alongside the likes of ID age verification and parental consent to "provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account." On top of that, they promise "new systems" to limit minors' interactions with adult strangers.
</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not."</p><p>Roblox's facial age estimation works by "analysing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features", at which point the user's assigned to one of three groups, under 13, over 13, and over 18. The experience the game offers changes based on which bucket folks land in, and "certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox" for those flagged as under 13 years old.</p>
<p>So, it's a slightly more in-depth iteration of the photo-based age checks you may well have had to do as part of the measures many sites and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">services</a> have launched in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, with the likes of credit card and ID checks often being the alternatives. These checks haven't proven to be totally bulletproof (hello, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">Norman Reedus' Death Stranding mug</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the legal action from Louisiana, Roblox has also faced child safety criticism from politicians like <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition">Democrat Ro Khanna</a>. This isn't the first time the game has made headlines for mistreatment of children, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting game creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers also having been lobbied at it. </p>
<p>Those behind Roblox have annoucned other steps recently to protect kids who are hopping in for a bit of Grow a Garden. That's included <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">cracking down on "vigilantes"</a> who were impersonating minors in an alleged effort to catch adults behaving inappropriately, something the game's overseers argued was only confusing matters.</p>

        <p>Loose-lipped patent filings sink ships again</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Thanks to a combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-might-be-moving-closer-to-a-steam-controller-2-and-new-vr-controllers-rumours-say">datamining</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">public paperwork</a>, we know that Valve are working on, have recently been working on, or are vaguely interested in working on a thick catalogue of different PC hardware. Besides a long-rumoured Steam Machine successor, we’ve also seen evidence of an all-in-one VR headset – codenamed Deckard – and a new take on the Steam Controller, while preliminary tinkerings with a Steam Deck 2 are likely underway even with Valve’s warnings that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on">it’s a few years off</a>. Now, it looks like one of these has a name: the Steam Frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The moniker appears in, once again, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857">a Valve filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370861">Two</a>, in fact: one to trademark the Steam Frame as computer hardware and another to cover it under game consoles and peripherals. As well as "Cutlery, Machinery, Tools and Parts Thereof" and "Musical Instruments and Supplies," apparently. Trademark law is weird.</p>
<p>I’m going to ignore my legendarily poor record of predication-making on this website and take a punt on the Steam Frame most probably being Deckard, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a> replacement that can supposedly run games off itself instead of needing to be hooked up to a separate PC. I’m guessing that the included controllers would require that second trademark application to cover it under peripherals specifically, and although that could also mean the filings are pointing to the new Steam Controller (or maybe even the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>)... I dunno, "Frame" just sounds like a more fitting name for a VR kit, mainly because all the straps and clips involved can make it feel like you’re wearing scaffolding. Doubt it’s going to be a knife and fork set, anyway.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe it’s all just a spot of arse-covering in case Valve simply like the name and want to dibs it for something later. Trademark and patent documents are, infamously, a source of fanciful bullshit (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sony-patent-mcdonalds/">MCDONALD'S!</a>) as often as they are for genuine glimpses of future tech. Then again, it wouldn’t be the first time that Valve’s regulatory dealings hinted at real, almost retail-ready products: the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was indirectly revealed by US and South Korean authorities certifying its upgraded Wi-Fi card.</p>
<p>We’ll see, either way. Also, just to avoid this article ending on an exceptionally nerdy note about Wi-Fi, did you know the USPTO is currently trying to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/02/u-s-appeals-court-uspto-must-reconsider-if-fucks-are-for-everyone/">decide if someone can trademark the word 'Fuck'?</a></p>
