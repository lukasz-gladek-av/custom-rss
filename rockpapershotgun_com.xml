            <p>In a year that has so far seen some demanding giants like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, I have found myself routinely playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190000/Car_Mechanic_Simulator_2021/">Car Mechanic Simulator 2021</a>, a four-year-old sim that has you repeatedly changing the brake pads on busted vehicles and scavenging old engine parts from a nearby junkyard. So I feel a quiet delight to learn of the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/car-dealer-simulator">Car Dealer Simulator</a>, due to release next month, which will let me not only fix up old bangers, but also sell the absolutely banjaxed pieces of trash to unsuspecting bozos. Heh heh heh. Yes. YES.</p>

<p>The sim is due out May 29th. Your job is simple. "Buy low, fix up, and sell high," says the game's Steam blurb. You will be working at a run-down dealership (mis)managed by a country singer lookin' fella named Little Sam. But work hard enough and you'll take over the business. You'll have to diagnose and fix issues with each vehicle, but you'll also turn a blind eye to a few problems too. Put some paint over that badly corroded crossbar. They'll never notice.</p>
<p>"Presenting a car to the customer requires a few tricks," say the developers in the game's description. "Washing, good photos, and an engaging advertisement will be your allies. Highlight the car’s strengths in your listing, but remember—every car has its hidden flaws. Customers buy with their eyes, so use the shine of the paint, a full tank, and quality photos to your advantage."</p>

<p>As someone who recently bought a used car only to find that half the steering apparatus was rotten and two tires were the wrong bloody size, I am excited to relive my experience from the other dastardly perspective. This is how we build understanding. Embrace the jerk. Become the jerk. (A trick I like to do when I'm short of money in Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is to take on a job and strip the customer's car for parts to sell. It's okay, I always rebuild their vehicle... Eventually.) </p>
<p>Car Dealer Simulator has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3413480/Car_Dealer_Simulator_Demo/">a demo on Steam</a> for anyone looking to give it a go. Developers Garage Monkeys previously made two related sims: Car Washer Simulator and Car Rental Simulator. Both allowing players to run reputable and respected business ventures, I'm sure. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA have announced they're "pausing" development of any future rally racers, including the filth-speckled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wrc">WRC</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dirt-5">Dirt</a> series. Many rally games have historically been made by the now EA-owned studio Codemasters, a crowd of long-time motorsports specialists who've been soiling wheel arches as far back as Colin McCrae Rally for the first PlayStation. Well, no more, say the big wigs. The games have "reached the end of the road", they say. Bad news for fans of muck and sand on wheels, but there is a splash of muddy hope just past the next hard right.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players," said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">a statement</a> from Codemasters. "Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and Dirt. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge."</p>
<p>All those games have now tumbled off that ragged edge, just like 10-year-old me playing Colin McCrae Rally on a PS1 demo disc in 1998. Codemasters have been responsible for much of the genre over the past few decades with the Dirt series, as EA mention above. But the parallel WRC series has also flown the flag, going through the hands of many different developers and publishers. French studio Kylotonn made the games for a while, publishing under Bigben Interactive. Codies got the license to make WRC games in 2020, and then everything became one big corporately consolidated parking lot when Codemasters themselves were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/electronic-arts-have-bought-codemasters">snorted up by EA</a> the following year. </p>

<p>So, we can add the deletion of blockbuster rally games from the near future to the many negative effects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">corporations binge eating other smaller businesses</a>. It's not yet clear how this decision has impacted workers at Codemasters, but it is obviously concerning given EA's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">wave of layoffs</a>. EA has cut between 300 and 400 jobs across their company this week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">reports by Bloomberg</a>.

</p><p>There is one faint god ray shining into these roadside puddles. Rally is (and always has been) open to smaller developers. In particular, the low-poly indie racer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a> has been favourably received by dirtsters. And <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> offers similar Sega Saturnesque drifts around high-rise parking facilities. There's also the lesser-known <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/">Old School Rally</a>, and the illegal rally racing in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>. Uh, provided you know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">how to build an entire car</a> from scratch. We have a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a> too, if you fancy that. </p>
<p>Remember: when big corpos buy out all the bacon, go looking for the tasty lardons. Also, this doesn't necessarily mean the end for WRC games. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, the international vroomsports body that runs the real life World Rally Championship) has teased <a href="https://x.com/OfficialWRC/status/1917610425153097758">on Xitter</a> that the game series will continue in the hands of another developer somewhere, as pointed out by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/ea-says-codemasters-wont-be-making-any-more-rally-games-weve-reached-the-end-of-the-road-working-on-wrc/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Now our WRC gaming franchise is going in an ambitious new direction," they say, "with more news coming in the near future."</p>
