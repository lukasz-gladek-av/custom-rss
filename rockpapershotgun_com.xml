            <p>Real gamblers play russian roulette with shotguns. That is the core concept of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-looking game of blinksweat and bulletworry. It's been out for a while now but the developers have just added a fun extra - a 4-person multiplayer mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>They teased this multiplayer mode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unnerving-2-gem-buckshot-roulette-is-working-on-a-multiplayer-mode-so-you-can-play-shotgun-roulette-with-pals">earlier in the year</a> but just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/4477234095318892693">posted the update on Steam</a> yesterday. The game remains one of uncertain trigger pulling. A handful of shells - some duds, some live - are loaded into a shotgun in a random and unseen order. Players then take turns pointing the gun at one another (or themselves) and committing their lives to lady luck. Click! Phew, this one was a dud. </p>
<p>But look, what's Nipplemancer69 doing? He's slugging a beer, ejecting a shell, clicking on a mysterious gadget, and smoking a cigarette... Wait, wait, don't point that at me, Nipplemancer69! Have you even kept count of the shells correctly!? Stop. STOP.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Oh thank heavens. Between each reloading of the shotgun you get a bunch of items to make use of against your friends, you see. A cell phone with a mysterious voice on the other end, for example, who tells you what the fifth or sixth shell will be. Or a gizmo that lets you steal a device straight out of your opponent's pile. All this on top of the main game's health-regenerating cigarettes and beer cans that let you eject a shell. </p><p>There are other devices I'm far less keen on. These cause players to miss a turn, for instance, or reverse the turn order of the entire table. It's possible as a result to play a whole round without ever even laying hands on the gun. Turn-skipping mechanics in board games annoy me for the same reason. It's frustrating to sit there and helplessly watch an entire game happen around you. And in a chatless internet game setting, it really invites people to quit. I much prefer the more interesting gadgets, like the do-hicky that reverse the "polarity" of the shell in the chamber. </p>
<p>It's best done with pre-existing pals - there's no servers. If you do want to shoot strangers though, you can join the Discord of the game's publisher, Critical Reflex, where lots of people are dumping lobby codes into a "looking for game" channel. It's not perfect as multiplayer goes, but on the plus side it's a supremely cheap game at around £2. So the buy-in is not particularly high. And the core concept - trying to keep track of live rounds and dud rounds while people muddy the waters with gadgetry - remains compelling enough to get a few tense and funny moments, as players miscount and accidentally blow their own heads off. (Yes, I did do this. Leave me alone.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users. Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">post</a> on EA’s tech support hub, Respawn’s immediate culling of ApeLeg’s Linux support – which, to be clear, effectively renders it unplayable on SteamOS – is a well-meaning sacrifice to the anti-cheat pantheon. The post explains that Linux is particularly vulnerable to exploitation by hacker types, due to it not allowing anti-cheat measures access to the deep, dark levels of OS kernel space that they typically need to block non-kosher modifications.</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex," it reads. "While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today."</p>
<p>Yeah. I dunno. While it is technically true that Linux is more protective of its kernel space than Windows (ironically, this is in part to ensure all its drivers remain open source), I’ve been playing Apex Legends since it released nearly six years ago, and I’ve been rolled over by a passing aimbotter... twice? Maybe thrice? I’ve never felt the impression that its legit playerbase is being held at the mercy of a horde of rampaging Linux abusers. As such, it’s hard to agree that effectively banning an entire operating system, taking out the world’s most widely played handheld PC in the process, is a proportionate response.</p><p>For bonus bafflement, Respawn have previously been unusually supportive of the Deck, working with Valve back in 2021 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">improve SteamOS compatibility with Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and earn Apex a coveted Steam Deck Verified badge. Today, that cheerful green tick is replaced by the grumpy grey of Unsupported status. And that’s saying nothing of the small (but, if they’re still playing a shooter from 2019, loyal) contingent of desktop Linux/SteamOS players who’ve now been locked out as well.</p>
<p>Windows-based handhelds, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/asus-rog-ally">Asus ROG Ally</a> series and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a>, are unaffected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You remember Lucas Pope, right? He who casually dropped two of the most influential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> games ever then got distracted by yellow cranks for six years, occasionally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lucas-pope-marks-10-years-of-papers-please-with-a-free-demake-for-your-browser">popping up</a> to drop <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/lcd-please">a demake</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a>? Well, Pope has ceased hogging that crank, for now at least, and just released Haloween-y <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> Moida Mansion. It’s on Itch <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion">here</a>, and it’s completely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> to play in your browser.</p>

<p>It’s a beautifully presented thing, faux-encased in a red, four button handheld. “Oh no!” reads the mock-up instruction manual. “The Adventure Club’s official mascot turtle has carelessly wandered into Moida Mansion. Your friends went after her and got trapped! They broke the golden T.A.C rule: “Stay out of Moida Mansion!” Now it’s up to you. Sneak in and rescue them before it’s too late!”</p>
<p>The idea here is that you’ll explore the Moida Mansion in first person, listening for noises to locate your missing mates. It’s basically a very elaborate game of hide and seek. There’s also puzzles, helpful and harmful inhabitants to meet, and a ‘monsta’ chasing you around. No word on whether the New Yoik-ification of these terms has any bearing on the actual game, but maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UPXUG8q4jKU?feature=share">pizza rat</a> will show up at some point.</p><p>It’s fair to say Pope has a penchant for retro presentation. The excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return Of The Obra Dinn </a>utilised early Macintosh monochrome, and the Playdate itself has its own, stripped back style. If you’re yet to play Obra Dinn itself, it’s safe to say it’s somewhat of an RPS favourite: one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-games-of-the-decade-on-pc">favourite PC games</a> of the 2010’s, actually. “Obra Dinn asks you to tease out social lives from a freeze frame of murder,” was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review">wot Matthew</a> (RPS in peace) reckoned. “It doesn’t take the little grey cells to realise this is remarkable stuff.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
