            <p>Fire up the geiger counter, the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> just showed off a trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It premieres on 17th December.</p>
<p>If it wasn't clear already, this chain of episodes is set to take us to NEW VEGAS. I said NEW VEGAS. That's NEW VEGAS, the setting of obscure 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: NEW VEGAS</a>. Understand? I don't think you do, so let's all look over here while I point to this sign. It says Lucky 38, which is a casino in NEW VEGAS.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I doth protest this much because I'm a NEW VEGAS fan who's looking forward to taking in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-tv-creators-saved-iconic-elements-for-season-2-so-it-doesnt-feel-like-they-just-skimmed-wikipedia">second series of Fallout</a> when it premieres in December. Ahead of that, this outing of it showed us The Ghoul and Lucy heading to New Vegas in pursuit of a certain someone (I won't say who, to avoid series one spoilers). Between the trailer and little chat actors Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and the showrunners had with the Geoffman, we look to be getting a lot more of that Purnell/Goggins duo rubbing off on each other in series two, which sounds great to me.</p><p>They'll have to do a lot to pry my attention away from everyone's favourite preservation tube-dwelling Fallout billionaire, though. After popping in briefly in series one, NEW VEGAS' own Robert Edwin House looks to be playing a big role in series two. He and Walton Goggins' Cooper Howard are having plenty of pre-war chats, which see the suave, moustachioed House stare deeply into the Goggler's eyes while talking down to him just like he does to a certain videogame mailperson. Phwoar, Bob Residence. If you weren't a shrivelled prune by the time my character reached you, they'd have stabbed you through some bedsheets after a round or two, rather than that Benny.</p>
<p>Despite all the NEW VEGAS, I'm keen to see whether, with all of of its major characters all now set up and past the early stages of a playthrough when you're still convinced you're not gonna resort to speccing into speech, the series does anything major to take Fallout places it's not been. The likes of new factions or visits to locations the games haven't touched, just to spice up the big screening of things we know and love. Though, I'm aware that's something that I may well be in the minority on, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">massive popularity</a> of the first series.</p> <div>

<p>Either way, odds are Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, and co will once again be the faces of a good post-apocalyptic adventure, and one that looks like it's leaning heavily into pre-war flashbacks of NEW VEGAS in all its glory.</p>
<p>That's NEW VEGAS, lest you forget amid your Silver Rush to get on Tops of all the other Gamescom Opening Night live news.</p>

            <p>Remember the spy-themed game ZA/UM have settled into making after all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> drama? Well, unless they've got another espionagey cRPG in the works, Project C4 has gotten a new name in a cameo at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It now seemingly goes by Zero Parades.</p>
<p>Yep, amid the waves of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-playable-disco-elysium-2-prototype-in-the-wilds-according-to-a-report-on-clashes-between-the-spiritual-successors">spiritual successors</a>, after all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy around the exits of key team members</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellations of Discoey things</a>, this is the thing those who remain at the studio have been working on. It looks and sounds very Disco Elysiumy.</p>

<p>The Keighleybot intrduced Zero Parades trailer as a "first look" at a spy RPG ZA/UM have been working on. Oh, you mean the spy game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-it-all-disco-elysiums-original-studio-have-revealed-espionage-filled-new-game-c4">revealed earlier this year</a>, Project C4, I mouthed at the screen. Geoff didn't answer, or even mention the name Project C4. So, unless this is an example of spyish doubling up to confuse a foe, I assume the two must be one in the same.</p><p>Anyway, in Zero Parades, the name for which comes with a host of optional taglines including "Zero Parades for fake radicals", which given all that's happened with folks seen as radical ideasmiths leaving ZA/UM in the Disco aftermath feels maybe a bit cheeky. Anyway, in this game you play as an operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, who's described as being "brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed", as well as "an Anti-Icon". Hershel's also a woman, so modify the mental image of Harry Du Bois that description's inevitably given you a little bit. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">Steam page</a> continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you've been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again. Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In Zero Parades, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</blockquote>
<p>Much like in Project C4's reveal, a big thing's made of the fact you'll be failing a lot, and tha your failure will take you places via improvisation. Places that might not be as ideal, but that be how the dice are sometimes.</p>
<p>Zero Parades, or the artist that looks to be formerly known as Project C4, is currently without a release date. You can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">here</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
