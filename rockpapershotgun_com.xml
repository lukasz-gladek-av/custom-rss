            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have finally revealed which patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are suing them about. It looks like they're focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.</p>
<p>If you've somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it's a bestselling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.</p> <!--more-->
<p>When Palworld hit Steam in January, there was an outcry from some Pokémon players that it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">broken Pokémon's copyright</a>. After an ominous interlude, Nintendo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">announced legal proceedings against Pocketpair in September</a>, declaring that the corporation would "continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years."</p>
<p>Rather than going after Palworld's monster designs, which definitely look a hell of a lot like certain Pokémon, Nintendo claim Pocketpair have broken their patents on specific game mechanics. They didn't specify which patents at the time, but Pocketpair have now listed three in a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">post</a> published today. They also report that Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are seeking an injunction against Palworld, together with late payment damages for the use of their patents.</p><p>The formatting of Pocketpair's post makes the exact amount sought in damages unclear - it could be that Nintendo and the Pokémon Company want five million yen each, or that they want five million yen in total. For clarity, the Pokémon Company isn't a Nintendo subsidiary but the result of a joint investment by the companies holding the copyright and trademark on Pokémon - Game Freak, Creatures and Nintendo.</p>
<p>"The Plaintiffs claim that "Palworld," released by us on January 19, 2024, infringes upon the following three patents held by the Plaintiffs, and are seeking an injunction against the game and compensation for a portion of the damages incurred between the date of registration of the patents and the date of filing of this lawsuit," reads the post.</p>
<p>The patents in question were all applied for and registered this year, after the early access launch of Palworld. They are: Patent No. 7545191, applied for on 30th July and registered on 27th August; Patent No. 7493117, applied for on 26th February and registered on 22nd May, and Patent No. 7528390, applied for on 5th March and registered on 26th July.</p>
<p>I've looked the patent numbers up on the <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/">Japan Platform for Patent Information</a>, aka J-PlatPat, which has Japanese-to-English machine translation. Here are their machine-translated overviews. There's a lot more detail on each patent page, of course, including diagrams, but it should give you a rough indication.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7545191/15/en">Patent No. 7545191</a><br>
"Determining, in a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space based on a second operation input, and causing, in a second mode, a player character to shoot, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character placed on a field in the virtual space based on a third operation input Based on the second operation input, the aiming direction is determined, and based on the third operation input, the player character is caused to shoot the battle character in the aiming direction."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7493117/15/en">Patent No. 7493117</a><br> 
"A sighting direction within a virtual space is determined based on second operation input in a first mode, a player character is allowed to release an item affecting a field character disposed on a field within a virtual space toward the sighting direction on the basis of third operation input, a sighting direction is determined based on second operation input in a second mode, and the play character is allowed to release a fighting character who fights toward the sighting direction on the basis of the third operation input."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/en">Patent No. 7528390</a><br>
"In one example of a game program, a riding object for ground or an aerial riding object is selected by a selection operation, and a player character is made to ride on the selected riding object. In the case that the player character riding on the aerial riding object moves toward the ground, a change is automatically made to a state in which the player character rides on the riding object for ground so that the player character can move on the ground."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pocketpair aren't backing down. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," they write in the new post. They also aren't responding to individual media inquiries, for the moment - we'll all hear more via their website.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>I was going to do a ‘Kermit/Commit’ bit, but then you’d all just be insufferable about frogs and toads</p>

            <p>In all honesty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toads-of-the-bayou">Toads Of The Bayou</a> could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190400/Toads_of_the_Bayou/">Steam demo</a> ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into The Breach</a>: turn based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.</p>

<p>Toads Of The Bayou loves shops, is the first thing I found out about it. There’s four different ones in your home base, where you’ll lead a rebellion against Haitian Vodou figure Baron Samedi. You’ll select missions from a map, gather resources, then spent them on either more combat cards, companions, or single use traps and various other bufo-buffs. You’ve also got your own inventory of consumable items, and your starting toad generates barricades by killing enemies, which you can plonk down on a map - helpful, since most maps have an objective to project.</p>
<p>If you fail an objective, you’ll get ‘curse cards’ put into your deck, which can then show up randomly and ruin your day. Allegedly anyway, I was simply too good to have this happen. Cards cost action points, and there’s a few neat twists even in the small slice I played. Your movement card, for example, is free to play, but loses one movement per card you’ve played before it. So you can attack before moving, but you’ll be less effective. Some cards push enemies into obstacles for extra damage, and some let you switch places with them, which you can use to your advantage since they’ll be locked into their attacks by then. </p><p>There’s also permadeath, but it’s the fun kind that gives you upgrades for the next run. It all seems a fair bit more thoughtful and expansive than what I’d originally suspected, which was rote turn-based combat coasting on the back of its very good toads. But it does not coast, and the toads are better for it. It’s also out this month if you like the demo - 19th November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a>, Nvidia’s PC-focused game streaming service, will begin calling time on its most muscular of power users. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">post on the GFN subreddit</a> announced the introduction of a 100-hour monthly cap (or "allowance"), effective from January 1st 2025 for anyone who signs up after that date. Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nvidia claim the vital importance of this hitherto completely unnecessary limit involves "providing exceptional quality and speed — as well as shorter queue times", and that 100 hours per month will "comfortably" accommodate 94% of current users. Obviously, if you are part of that remaining 6%, your newfound constraints won’t be reflected in any kind of subscription price cut or discount. But hey, you can always pay Nvidia <em>more</em> cash to unlock extra time. $6 for 15 hours on the Ultimate tier, to be exact, or $3 for 15 hours on the Priority tier, which is being renamed Performance.</p>
<p>15 hours of any unused time will also carry over each month, though even with these small concessions, I’m not sure that they’ll be enough to convince both heavy users and potential new customers to get on board. Would you sign up for <em>any</em> subscription service knowing it’s going to become materially worse in a year’s time? And for what purpose? Nvidia cite the relatively small proportion of users who’d exceed a 100-hour limit as justification for imposing it, but by that same logic, it’s only a handful of people jostling for that extra bandwidth. Anecdotally, I sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">use GeForce Now for playing Steam Deck games</a> that the handheld itself can’t handle, and I’ve never had trouble with queue times or streaming quality. If these 6% are a drain on the system, they’re being awfully polite about it.</p>
<p>What’s also a shame is that this "allowance" is being foisted alongside a range of other changes that, largely, sound quite good. The Performance-née-Priority membership will start offering 2560x1440 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide</a> resolution options, with ultrawide previously being exclusive to the Ultimate tier, and both types are gaining the ability to save custom graphics setting configurations across different streaming sessions. Alas, the march of service decay continues, with the only way to continue enjoying unlimited streaming time being a GeForce Now Founders subscription – and those haven’t been available for new signups since 2021.</p>
<p>In other news, Nvidia this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-surpasses-36-trillion-market-value-after-trump-win-2024-11-07/">surpassed a market value of $3.6 trillion</a>, a global first that cemented their position above Apple as the world’s most valuable company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
