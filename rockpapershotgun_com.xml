            <p>Warner Bros. Games aren't pushing the brakes on games with live service elements any time soon, despite the whole Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League debacle. A new job listing at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> studio WB Games Montréal suggests their upcoming game will have at least some of those long-term servicey bits to it.</p>
<p>Or, at the very least, its executive producer will need to be someone who knows what live services are and can do some live service strategising.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/">executive producer listing</a> is looking for a senior dev to "lead the development of a high-quality AAA game based on one of the iconic IPs from the vast Warner Bros. and DC Comics catalog". The duties which'll come as part of that involve a need to "oversee all phases of development, from concept to post-launch live operations."</p>
<p>Things get a tiny bit more specific about that last bit further on, mentioning the successful applicant needs to have a hand in "post-launch content and live service strategy" designed to keep players engaged long-term. "Deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," is also listed in the qualifications and experience section, in case those previous examples aren't enough mentions of the L and S words for you.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. write that they're keen to see that the game "not only meets its goals but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible within the WB and DC universe", which could well just be job advert speak, but the explicit emphasis on a need for "critical and commercial success" that accompanies it is a noteworthy given the context.</p>
<p>If this project does turn out to be a live service-focused DC game, it'd be following in the footsteps of notorious flop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. In case you need a refresher, that game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-its-publisher-says">failure</a> saw it miss its financial targets and become the poster child for a tough period at Warner Bros. Games that eventually led to this year's reshuffling at the publisher, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego all being shuttered</a>.</p>
<p>There've also reportedly been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">rounds</a> of layoffs at developers Rocksteady over the past year, because this is the games industry.</p>
<p>ARPG Gotham Knights, while not a hugely high-profile failure like Suicide Squad, ended up attracting mixed reviews at debut in 2022. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-review">Our Ed</a> said it contained "the tiniest shreds of goodness", but confessed to not wanting to play more of it once he was done reviewing. Our Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gotham-knights-is-on-game-pass-and-who-knows-it-might-surprise-you">a bit more of a fan</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that if the Montréal studio are being saddled with the need to do a live service - possibly to counteract what's left of Rocksteady being permitted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report">go back to singleplayer</a> by Warner's corporate overlords - they're at least spared the sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">bad time it sounds like the latter group of devs had</a> creating their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">big, confused online thing</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-suicide-squads-fate-warner-bros-look-set-to-have-gotham-knights-devs-make-a-live-service-game]]></content:encoded>

            The human world is a tedious place consisting of grocery trips, laundry and tax returns, so let's all go be janky-ass wolves. We shall coordinate to bring down elk amidst the engulfing winter snows of the Yellowstone Caldera, duel with cougars under starbound skies, and do adorable bellywiggles in what is possibly our own poop, though I'm not sure if the simulation covers the entire lupine digestive cycle. If that's not enticement enough, we can do some wolf sex and raise a litter of cubs together. We shall manage our cubs by means of leather spreadsheets that look like they were recently mauled by hungry, horny wolves. </p><!--more-->
<p>WolfQuest! The very name huffs and splutters the same spirit of tacky adventure I once inhaled from shareware CD game compilations back in the 1990s. You know, that glorious epoch when you could just slam together two random words around a capital letter and really bottle the lightning. CheeseWang! HatShoe!</p>
<p>This isn't quite that old: I gather that the original version of WolfQuest is from 2005. Then as now, it's an open world simulation with a pronounced educational component (yes, there <em>is</em> a wolfopedia) set in the Yellowstone National Park. Developers eduweb have just released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/926990/WolfQuest_Anniversary_Edition/">anniversary edition</a> out of early access, and I am writing about it because this is precisely the morale boost I need in a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">staff departures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">calibrating the acceptability of pseudo-incest</a>. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It speaks terribly for my state of mind that I am still laughing at the bit in the trailer when one of your pups gets stolen by an eagle. Ah dang, that's the third one this week! It also speaks terribly of my state of mind that I can't stop laughing at this line on the Steam page: "Build a pack and raise pups year to year in a special 2-Player Mode, until one of you dies of old age." In the game, yes? In the game, right, eduweb?</p>
<p>I also can't stop laughing at the mention of an "IronWolf" mode. I know they're referring to permadeath in XCOM, but come on, tell me that there isn't something innately hilarious about an iron wolf. Let's see those fucking eagles fly off with that one! Who's top of the foodchain now, you godless skyweasels? I'll bellywiggle on your grave.</p>
<p>I am going to have an extended cackle in the cupboard and see if I can get it all out of my system. While I'm away, here are some bullet points to answer any WolfQuestions you might care to ask.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Live the life of a wild wolf! Form your own pack and watch your adorable pups grow into adults and disperse, year after year, until your wolf dies. End your story on your deathbed, or select an heir to continue your legacy.</li>
<li>Dynamic day/night, weather and seasons immerse you into the wilderness.</li>
<li>Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Packmates and pups interact and play with each other. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions help find and choose a suitable mate.</li>
<li>A genetics system models inheritance of each wolf's genes, including eye color, physical and personality attributes, and genetic coat color.</li>
<li>Elk roam the lands in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers and other prey.</li>
<li>Animals behave and change to the seasons. Herds migrate through the year. Bucks and bulls spar in the autumn rut and shed their antlers. Cows and does give birth and raise their own young.</li>
<li>Rival wolf packs maintain and protect their own territories from intruders - like you!</li>
<li>Bears, cougars and coyotes will challenge you for their kills and defend their own.  </li>
<li>Optional Ironwolf Mode: Live life on the edge, where each decision counts and your death can't be taken back.</li>
<li>Over 100 Achievements and a variety of collectible objects hidden across the map, from shed antlers, skulls, to lost human items.</li>
<li>And a lot more!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The only WolfQuestion I have is: why did I not play this back in 2008, when Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfquest-is-go">first wrote about it</a>? "RPS Wolfpack, anyone?" he queried at the time. "I got stuck in a Moose," objected Kieron Gillen (also RPS in peace) in the comments, declining to share vital context in a way that has just now come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Alas and alack - as far as I can tell, Jim and Kieron did not subsequently have bizarro wolf/moose sex and start a distinct subspecies that survives and thrives on a long-forgotten server somewhere. Still, there's no reason we can't pick up where they left off. Perhaps I can persuade Graham to secure his legacy by participating in some wilderness doggo-bonking before he quits.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-dorks-it-is-not-too-late-to-be-a-janky-ass-wolf]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Set to become a concrete requirement early next year</p>

            <p>Microsoft have become the latest company to start introducing age verification measures in response to the the Online Safety Act that's just come into force in the UK. Folks logging into Xbox services with a Microsoft account from today will start getting optional notifications directing them to verify they're over 18, with the checks becoming a hard requirement in early 2026.</p>
<p>To be clear, these checks are UK-only for now, in line with this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">new legislation</a> that aims to stop users who aren't verified as over 18 seeing content that's illegal or deemed unsuitable for children.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by the console maker's vice president of gaming trust and safety, Kim Kunes. If you're on Sadness Island and have a Microsoft account that flags your age as 18 and over, then you should start getting notifications asking you to confirm how old you are via third-party verification software Yoti soon.</p>
<p>The check'll require you to take a live photo, upload one of your government-issued ID (in the form of a passport, driving licence, or national ID card), provide your mobile phone number, or enter your credit card details. So, the usual suite of stuff you'd probably rather not be giving out on a whim.</p>
<p>For now, these checks will stay optional, meaning you can truck on in the short term and retain access to all the usual features. Though, if you opt not to do it, once early 2026 rolls around a number of features on your account will be limited to working with friends only. These include voice and text comms, party functionality, game invites, and "user generated content", including the activity feed.</p>
<p>You'll also totally lose access to the looking for group and custom clubs features, Discord integration, and the ability to broadcast gameplay to Twitch.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we’ll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," Kunes wrote, "We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences."</p>
<p>In addition to forcing folks to upload snaps of their mugs to prove they're old enough to see a boob or a swear, the introduction of this Online Safety Act in the UK has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">led to modding sites changing how they handle adult content</a>, with some interesting consequences for certain modders and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-modder-makes-npc-cleanliness-optional-in-order-to-avoid-popular-non-sexy-mods-being-hidden-unnecessarily">their works</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>
