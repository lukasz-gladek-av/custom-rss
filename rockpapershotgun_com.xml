            <p>Dark Ties, the Like A Dragon spin-off game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-drops-in-early-2026-as-rgg-pair-remake-with-a-new-spin-off-starring-baddie-mine">set to arrive alongside Yakuza Kiwami 3 next year</a>, was originally just going to be a video. That was, obviously, until devs RGG studio opted to let folks wander around in the shoes of Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine, whose karaoke singing to a picture of a follically-challenged gangster they've now also explained.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These bits of info come from an interview Kiwami 3 director Ryosuke Horii and Yakuza series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto gave to Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863">Famitsu</a>, which has been partly translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>According to Horii, the original plan was for Dark Ties to ship with the remake, but be “something that could be viewed like a video”. However, the devs decided to make Mine playable as a tip of the hat to players who've rendered him one of the most popular Yakuza characters, despite only appearing in Yakuza 3 - unless you count the character's likeness being used in series spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p>
<p>Horii also acknowledged that the team were aware they likely wouldn't get another chance to let folks step into Mine's shoes, given his lack of appearances.</p>
<p>Naturally, because Yakuza, one of the results of that call to make calculating businessguy Mine playable is that players can do the series' usual array of wacky side activities as him, including belting out Baka Mitai at a karaoke booth. We've already gotten a taste of just that via videos of Kiwami 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show (head to the ten minute mark below). While flexing his pipes to deliver the sad ballad  made famous by Kazuma Kiryu, Mine stares at a photo of himself and bellicose underworld sidekick Tsuyoshi Kanda.</p>

<p>Dark Ties delves into the relationship between Mine and the bald Yakuza brawler, so it's not a huge surprise, but it did catch some long-time fans a bit off guard given that the former's presented as arguably having an even closer relationship with Tojo Clan chairman Daigo Dojima in Yakuza 3.</p><p>Famitsu asked Horii and Sakamoto why they opted to go with a snap of Kanda over Daigo. As a warning, I have relied on machine translation for the following answer from Horii, but it's too important a remark not to convey: "Well, that's where the punchline really hits home, isn't it? (laughs) If it were too ordinary, it would actually be rather disappointing."</p>
<p>Well, from now on that's how I'll be summing up the Yakuza series whenever anyone asks me if the games about duffing up tatted goons before getting up to zany hijinks are worth a go.</p>

*cavernous, torturous, 20-second-long sucking-in of breath*
</p><!--more-->
<p>
RICHAAAARRRRD. RICHAARD WAAAAALKER. RICHARD WALKER, DEPUTY EDITOR OF XBOX ACHIEVEMENTS. RETURN IT TO ME, RICHARD. RETURN WHAT IS OWED. YOU KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK. J'ACCUSE, RICHARD. J'ACCUSE YOU OF DÉROBING MA JEUX PORE LE ORDINATEUR. VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MON TACTICS RPG, RICHARD?? LE VAUTOUR ENCERCLE LA CARCASSE, LE BOL EST SUR LA TABLE - COMMENT PUIS-JE ME RENDER CHEZ LE BOULANGER????
</p>
<p>
The year was 2010 when you took it from me, Richard - the mother of all grid-based battlers, one of the greatest digital fables of all time, a thrilling study in dynastic intrigue and medieval warfare. I had yet to even finish the game myself, having long coveted it as a youth consigned to PS1 PAL purgatory. But I could not resist your overtures, Richard! I assumed that you would return it to me in a month, perhaps two. Little did I know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>' acclaimed branching Job system would school you in the dark arts of back-stabbing and betrayal, that it would poison your dove-white temperament and set you upon the road to villainy.
</p>
<p>
I thought we were bros, Richard! Kindred spirits forged in the flame of mutual incompetence! We came up in this business together! Remember when I held your dictaphone for you while you interviewed BioWare's Ray Muzyka, Richard? I was terrified it wouldn't pick up his audio, so resorted to kneeling between you like a penitent sinner, waggling the mic back and forth! We looked like idiots, but it's fine! It's fine! We got over it! I barely ever think of the scalding embarrassment and humiliation!! Muzyka is some kind of magic medicine brewer now, anyway - who gives a fuck what he thinks? The key thing is that it was a bonding experience, a foundation for everlasting trust! What did I ever do to you, Richard!? What crime have I committed for you to treat me this way?!?!
</p><p>
I name you, Richard, I name you in the public forum, in the court of our peers. With bleeding hands I carve these words in ten-feet high letters upon the mausoleum of posterity: "Here stands indicted Richard Walker, bastard. Faithless one! Breaker of oaths! Smudger of covenants! Pact-shirker! Dog-leech! Cut-purse! Larkspell! Trencher-mouth! Let none welcome him. Let all faces turn from him. Let all doors be closed to him! Let his food taste like ashes and his favourite videogames play like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>!"
</p>
<p>
You thought I had forgotten, Richard. And to be honest, I did forget, because <em>it has been such a very long time, Richard</em>, but Square Enix did not forget - today, they release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004640/FINAL_FANTASY_TACTICS__The_Ivalice_Chronicles/">a new version of the game on Steam</a> with enhanced visuals, and lo do I rouse in horrified recognition from my dreamless sleep in the murmuring silt of the abysmal sea, lo do I rise in the coruscating incandescence of my absolute fury and indignation to burst upon the surface world and accost the traitor! 
</p>
<p>
RICHAAAARD. RICHAAAARD WAAAALKER. My PSP's battery may have swollen up like a diseased appendix, but I still have my 32MB Memory Stick Duo with a campaign save. It cries out to me for vengeance! Vengeance upon that great unclean soul and fugitive from justice, Richard Walker, Deputy Editor of Xbox Achievements!

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Yesterday, a group of moneyfolk including private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">unveiled plans</a> to acquire Electronic Arts for an estimated $55 billion. 
</p>
<p>The buyers are committing $36 billion of their own equity (briefly and inexpertly, "equity" is the value of your assets after you deduct anything you owe), including the value of the PIF's existing investments in EA. They're making up the rest of the total thanks to a $20 billion loan from JPMorgan Chase Bank. How will they manage that massive debt? According to the Financial Times, who cite unnamed insiders, they're gambling on the deployment of generative AI tools as a gigantic cost-saving measure.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA's profits in the coming years, people involved in the transaction told the Financial Times," the paper <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">wrote</a> (paywall) in their own coverage of the story. The FT elsewhere commented that the acquisition "is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA's operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt."
</p>
<p>It isn't hugely surprising to hear that generative AI is part of the vision for EA's second coming as a private company, though the multiple billion dollar loan situation certainly raises the stakes. Like Microsoft and Ubisoft, EA have already poured a lot of resources into generative AI tools, via such initiatives as the Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division - not a reference to the mercs in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, apparently - whose efforts include <a href="https://www.ea.com/seed/news/siggraphasia2024-skull-carving">this intriguingly nightmarish blog about "skull carving"</a>. 
</p>
<p>They have also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">touted the tech at length to investors</a>, in language that ranges from daydreams about "deeper", "richer" experiences to the quieter prospect of "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality."  
</p>
<p>Back in May 2024, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/">assured moguls</a> that generative AI would make EA's game development processes "more efficient", commenting of the publisher's licensed football sims that "we've moved from being able to create stadiums in six months to six weeks", and that the technology would in general allow devs "to get to the fun more quickly."</p><p>Efficiency doesn't automatically mean "cutting staff", of course, but as Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">amply demonstrated</a>, workforce reduction is a conspicuous element of the great generative AI tomorrow. Wilson's gushing about stadiums came a few months after EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">laid off 5% of their workforce</a> - around 670 people - and around a year before EA laid off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">a further 300 people</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">closed one of their headline new studios</a>. I'm not sure these are the Extraordinary Experiences the people are searching for, Andrew.
</p>
<p>Best of luck to EA game developers navigating all this. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2027, pending approval from regulators, which could be a whole saga in itself - Microsoft spent years fighting the US Federal Trade Commission in courts after announcing that they would purchase Activision Blizzard. For a lot of EA teams, I suspect the greatest worry may be how being co-owned by the investment wing of a notoriously repressive country will affect their livelihoods and work. If you're an EA staffer and you'd like to chat about it all in anonymity, my email is in my bio.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> beefy update 1.2.5 arrives today, September 30th. Developers Firaxis have laid out its major tweaks and additions, which include new map types and city states, plus a revamp of the construction interface and a hefty helping of balancing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">polarising</a> 4X strategy nation-builder has gotten the likes of auto-explore and world wonder reworks in its last couple of monthly updates, with Firaxis having settled in for the long haul after an initial flurry of post-release tweaking. 1.2.5 is the first update the game's gotten since an undisclosed number of workers - "dozens of people", according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">Game Developer</a> sources - were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">laid off at Firaxis earlier this month,</a> in what publishers 2K told RPS was a "staff reduction" as the studio "restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity".</p>

<p>As outlined in the developer update video above, which is set to be followed by the full notes when the update goes live later today, the headline changes of 1.2.5 include the introduction of two new map types. These are dubbed Continents and Islands and Pangea and Islands, with both making use of improved map generation techniques in the form of Voronoi diagrams to grow their landmasses. For more on that, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">Edwin's piece on Firaxis senior graphics engineer Ken Pruiksma's recent deep-dive</a> into coloured geographical blobs.</p><p>Also new are two types of city state, which can crop up in any era. Expansionist states, as their name suggests, are most focused on population growth via acquiring land and food, while diplomatic ones are focused more on keeping their citizens happy and doing, well, diplomacy. Both come with different bonuses if you become suzerain of them, with existing city state bonuses also having been revamped.</p>
<p>That balancing has also been applied to various other aspects of Civ 7's economy, such as the maintenance costs of larger armies being uppe, so you've got to think a bit more about whether you need fifty different mobile cannons. That and other things you might spend gold on in later ages have been rendered a bit more expensive, in an effort to ensure the precious metal isn't too valuable as you get into modern times. It'll be interesting to see if those tweaks have nailed the right balance and don't potentially end up frustrating folks who prefer to spend a bit more freely.</p>
<p>In terms of Leaders, Napoleon's Emperor and Revolutionary forms have been buffed, with the former getting greater rewards from the use of sanctions, while the latter earns more culture from battles. Finally, as part of continued efforts to revamp Civ 7's initialy panned interface, building menus have been retooled to offer more info in terms of the numerical effects changes to tiles will have before you make them. "We won't tell you the best tile to pick, that's still up to you," Firaxis senior game designer Taymoor Rehman said of these tweaks in that dev video. "But the UI should take a lot of the guesswork out." The studio have also put out a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/developing-settlements/">larger blog</a> diving into the fine details of these number-heavy interface revampings.</p>
<p>That's it in terms of big changes in this update, but Rehman did indicate that the balancing bits of it are "only step one of a larger balance pass", so there's more number tweakage to come down the line as Firaxis keep cranking away at cash and goods-related knobs and levers.</p>
