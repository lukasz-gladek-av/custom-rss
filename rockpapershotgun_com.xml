            <p>
Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is the tale of an alternate timeline in which the Nazis got hold of mechs and promptly overran the British Isles. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grit-and-valor-1949-is-a-real-time-into-the-breach-or-at-least-vaguely-similar-enough-that-i-can-squeeze-a-more-popular-game-in-this-headline">semi-alluded</a> last year, you could summarise the game itself as the product of a timeline in which the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> decided to make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a> instead. Except that it isn’t quite as deviously made, based on the demo, and it isn’t turn-based. Ah, I do kind of wish it was turn-based.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Everything else here works for me, just about: the rustpunk stompiness of the mechs themselves; the rock-Patlabor-scissors relationships between those mechs and other units, spliced with questions of elevation and cover; the grid-based, rotating maps floating against sepia voids, with waves of fascist scum arriving by chopper; the chunky graphic novel storytelling and kaiju-grade bosses. I just wish it wasn’t a real-time game. Still, that’s an opening impression and in fairness, you <em>can</em> issue unit orders while paused. Indeed, it’s generally better to when you’re aiming special abilities that have a cooldown. Perhaps it's secretly a turn-based game, then? Here’s a trailer.

The plot here is that you’re fighting your way from Scotland to Berlin to detonate an EMP and silence those goose-stepping Gundamns for good. The campaign unfolds across a node-based map, with certain branches taking you to riskier, more rewarding or easier, less lucrative encounters. During each mission, you’ll need to keep your HQ truck alive while weighing the risks of going after optional objectives, like signal towers that take ages to capture, leaving your mechs exposed in the process. There are also paradropped supply crates that bestow a choice of power-ups, such as repairing this or that mech.
</p>
<p>
The maps are pleasingly cramped. Pleasingly for me, anyway. It feels like you’re presiding over a clash between rival antfarms. RTS fans may yearn for more elbow room. I do wonder if Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is angling for commute-friendly snackability, which makes its lack of Steam Deck verification a bit concerning. Still, I enjoy the aesthetics here, and I could imagine the fundamentals supporting some denser tactical puzzles as the campaign wears on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911860/Grit_and_Valor__1949/">Read more on Steam</a>. It’s out… today!

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> may have entered its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"most intensive" production phase</a> but it won't be gracing your whirring machinery any time in the next year or two. During a financial call for people in suits with lots of money, the developer said they were hoping to give shareholders value for money, "even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026." Basically confirming what you probably could've guessed anyway: there's no plan to bring the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel out before 2027.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4">earnings call</a> was mostly a slew of graphs and tables with lots of numbers. Horrifying stuff. But there were some comments from executives which eliminated the possibility of an early release for the anticipated open world RPG, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/">PC Gamer</a>. </p>
<p>"We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet," said CD Projekt Red's chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz when asked about plans for the release during a Q&amp;A session. "All we could share now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the call, the studio also asserted that they won't be using generative AI to help with development, mostly because of the legal problems it could cause in regards to copyright and such. </p>

<p>"Gen AI, to be honest, is quite tricky when it comes to legal IP ownership and so on, and many other aspects," said joint CEO Michał Nowakowski when asked about it. "So when it comes to implementation of any gen AI in the actual games, we really have nothing happening when it comes to Witcher 4 or any projects in the near future."</p>
<p>Although that doesn't rule out the company using the technology in the future, as even Nowakowski admits the studio has been "investigating the potential use of AI solutions in our future products, including development of our own customized AI models."</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4 trailer</a> confirmed that Ciri, not Geralt, would be the star of the next adventure. It saw her doing battle with an ancient spidery evil and suffering an unheroic outcome typical to The Witcher games. Placing Ciri at the centre of the story will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">let the game explore sexism within the fantasy world</a>, say CD Projekt. Which could be an interesting angle if done intelligently. You may also be glad to know that the in-universe card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gwent-returns-in-the-witcher-4-according-to-cd-projekts-heavy-hints">Gwent will be making a return</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
