            <p>Good news, people who've been struggling to form the perfect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> trifecta and don't fancy taking on the task of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-update-fixes-a-graphics-problem-and-makes-the-rpg-easier-in-single-player">battering Nightlords solo</a>. FromSoft have now confirmed that duo expeditions will be coming to the game later this year, as part of post-launch plans which also include "enhanced" fights against existing bosses.</p>
<p>"The Night is far from over," the studio <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">tweeted today</a> as it celebrated 3.5 million players having hopped in so far, "In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support."</p>
<p>So, no concrete dates yet, but at least you know that duos-centric post-launch support the game's director had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">previously hinted at</a> has now been locked in, alongside some other goodies. I mean, you can't really go wrong giving Fromsoft lovers another excuse to batter some big baddies, even if they've battered said baddies before.</p>
<p>Until these additions start to drop, those on PC do have the option of using mods to play as a terrifying twosome, with Seamless Co-Op maestro Yui having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">whipped out a duos mod</a> quicker than the average <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> attack.</p>
<p>Fromsoft may have chosen to focus on trios and lone fighters, but the people demand the chance to propose Nightreign as a date night option without having to link up with a third wheel. We'll see how those relationships fare if the studio opts to ratchet the difficulty up for duos, creating a test even tougher than having the in-laws over for tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a>. Go on, you know you want to.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
