            <p>I've heard things, Microsoft, and I think I'd rather die. About Windows 11, I mean, although there's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">that other stuff</a>. Instead, I'm choosing to escape to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by enshittification: <em>the past</em> (moon's done for already). Actual human immortality is due to launch by Q2 of 1999, and then all I'll have to do is upload my soul to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavenx">HeavenX</a>. This means I'll miss both the UK TV debut of The Sopranos <em>and</em> Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase but, eh, swings and roundabouts.</p>
<p>But, wait, there's anomalies in the system. Typical millennium shit. You know how it is. To fix them, you'll need to enter cyberspace and play with guns and cards. HeavenX bills itself as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> deckbuilder but stands out through 1. Exactly the kind of break beats I like writing to 2. Looking like the inside of your eyelids might if you pressed your fingers into your eyes for a bit after staring at a screensaver for three hours. You bet your sweet Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase I'm down. I couldn't find a trailer so just look at these cards with me for a bit.</p>
