            <p>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-youre-not-imagining-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-combat-feeling-off-theres-a-good-reason-for-it">lack of hitstop</a> in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://x.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522">handy breakdown of the issue</a> by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.</p>

<p>"Some of the changes in the hitstop were obviously intentional, and some were not implemented due to the settings of the game," director Yuya Tokuda said at a recent press event, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-hitstop-feels-way-better-in-the-non-beta-build-and-the-games-director-was-happy-to-juice-it-back-up-after-overseas-players-apparently-hated-it-in-world/">via GamesRadar</a>. "When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> was released, many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too hard and it made it difficult for them to play. So it's very positive feedback seeing the users who experienced the [Wilds open beta test] this time saying that they missed the hitstop that they were experiencing in past titles."</p><p>"It's a very unique <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> experience being able to experience that hitstop," Tokuda continued. "So it's very positive feedback from my perspective. In the current version that I think you guys had hands-on gameplay with, there was obviously a little bit of adjustment compared to the [open beta]. And for the full product version, there will be adjustments. For example, the finishing moves will have adjustments to hitstop as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/were-at-the-next-level-monster-hunter-wilds-creators-on-the-secret-behind-capcoms-new-golden-era/">Very Gary Computing</a> also had a big chat with the Wilds team, in which series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto also mentioned some bugs from the beta they’d since ironed out. "The monsters were moving more often than intended," he said. "It wasn’t actually a design intention to have them be so rapidly moving, it was just that every X amount of seconds they just were moving on, and it wasn’t something we were planning for - the general processing of how monsters decide where to go next and what to do, that’s being refined towards the full game."</p>
<p>The VGC piece is well worth a read, not least for Yuya Tokuda going into detail about the new endgame it sounds they’ve got planned for Wilds:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects will be related to the environmental change system that happens in Monster Hunter Wilds. You’ll be doing things like having a synergistic relationship between the monsters that you’re hunting and the environment itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you hunt this monster now, that might make something happen like this one becomes easier to hunt later or harder to hunt later. The details are going to be discussed later, but I’m confident that players who love [past games’] end-game cycles will be really pleased with what’s in store.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion: bonk. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Friday The 13th: The Game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> developers Illfonic have announced that they've laid off an unspecified number of staff as they "re-align" to "a refined strategy". No reasons for the layoffs are given in the statement, beyond a cursory gesture towards "the state of the industry".</p><!--more-->
<p>"Today we had to accept the harsh reality that the state of the industry has impacted us here at IllFonic," writes CEO and co-founder Charles Brunghardt <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/illfonic_an-update-from-illfonic-activity-7270138603437989888-6BkN/">on LinkedIn</a>. "It is with the heaviest of hearts that cuts to our teams had to be made today as we re-aligned to a refined strategy. There is a lot of talent in this group and if you or your team is hiring, please reach out so people can be connected to open roles."</p>
<p>The announcement doesn't confirm which teams have been affected, but Illfonic have offices in Colorado, Washington and Texas, USA. The company employed 78 people as of 2019, though this was before the founding of the Texas office.</p>
<p>As Matt Wales <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">comments</a> over at Eurogamer, it's possible the layoffs have something to do with the expiration of the license rights for Friday the 13th, which obliged IllFonic and publisher Gun Media to pull the video game adaptation from sale last December. The studio's most recent asymmetrical horror games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a> and Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, don't seem to have found a following, going by the latest Steam activity charts.</p><p>IllFonic had high hopes for Killer Klowns, despite the relative obscurity of the license, viewing it as more of an everyperson game than Friday The 13th. "We've found that asymmetrical horror games aren't always for the hardcore gamer, so we've really tried to balance this out to make it fun and interactive for any type of playstyle," CCO Jared Gerritzen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-multiplayer-horror-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-does-away-with-downtime">told Nic in May</a>. "We've found with [our previous games], fans that don't play videogames but love the IP will come in. With Klowns, this is that opportunity to bring that 'evade and escape' vs having that hardcore shooter mentality. I think we've got a really good balance."</p>
<p>I don't know the ratio of new hires to layoffs in 2024, but it's certainly been a "harsh" year for job losses. According to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">unofficial tracker</a>, around 14,000 people have lost their jobs this year, up from 10,500 in 2023. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">said goodbye to roughly 277 people in the course of "sunsetting" XDefiant</a>, their live service shooter. Brendy has been keeping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">an unofficial list</a> of the dire euphemisms companies use to sweeten the layoff pill in their official statements. For my money, the most baleful is surely Take-Two's "rationalizing" away the livelihoods of hundreds of staff. But "refining" your workforce is pretty obnoxious too, with its suggestion of purging the impurities during the smelting process.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all IllFonic devs who are now looking for work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
