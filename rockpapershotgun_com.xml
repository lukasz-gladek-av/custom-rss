            <p>When I first played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> I had trouble working out what it wanted to be – Spider-Man? The Witcher? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>? Dragon’s Dogma? Jedi Academy? The first of three new talkthrough videos from developers Pearl Abyss has helped concentrate the game in my mind. This is a grittier medieval fantasy take on The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom, isn’t it! Those airborne ruins are a dead giveaway. All it’s missing is the elegance and feeling of completeness. OK, it doesn’t have a magic vehicle editor, either. That I know about. Without further ado, here’s the video.

<p>
Crimson Desert looks madder than a catful of hatters. If you’re wondering why main guy Kliff Macduff walks in such a weirdly jerky way, like a toddler on springs, it’s probably because he’s trying to restrain the compressed energies of every open world mechanic ever devised. He can grapple. He can mech pilot. He can throw barrels and do wrestling moves. He can fish.</p>
<p>I don’t mean this as criticism, though I don’t entirely mean it as praise, either. I strongly suspect that this game is going to be a triumphant combination of mechanically silly and tonally self-serious and savagely broken in a way that somehow demands to be experienced for tens of hours. 
</p><p>

In watching the video, you are sparing yourself the derangement of mastering Crimson Desert’s control scheme, assuming they haven’t revised it since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crimson-desert-is-a-dork-ass-enormity-of-an-open-world-action-rpg">I played the game last year</a>. I got thrown in the deep end with that preview, asked to make sense of a midgame Kliff with a multitude of clashing abilities to choose from, while fending off the hydra of jetlag.
</p><p>I spent a lot of my demo either caterpaulting Kliff Macduff into holes, or confusing Kliff Macduff with all the people killing Kliff Macduff, or plaintively asking the PR to explain why Kliff Macduff is on fire now. The boss QTEs are like something out of the original Steel Battallion. You will beg for the sweet relief of a Bennett Foddy game. Anyway, Crimson Desert is out on March 19th this year.</p>

            <p>Break out your blocky cybernetic killing apparatus and the sort of shotgun Arnold Schwarzenegger might have wielded on the big screen back in the days of big hair and cocaine. Huntdown: Overtime, a prequel to side-scrolling shoot-em-up Huntdown has been announced and is set to arrive in early access this year.</p>

<p>Building on the arcadey cyberpunk gangland arse-kicking of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/598550/HUNTDOWN/">predecessor</a>, Huntdown: Overtime puts a roguelite twist on the carnage, with cybernetically-enhanced bounty hunter John Sawyer taking out as many targets as he can per run, before being dragged back to a cyber-doc's operating table on death. As you go, you'll murderdeath a lot of foes and gradually unfurl Sawyer's origin story by morphing from mostly man, part killer toaster to mostly killer toaster, part man.</p>
<p>"We've tried to capture that relentless, forward-momentum gunplay from classic action movies and modern ones like John Wick," said Tommy Gustafsson, art director at devs Easy Trigger Games. "Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run."</p><p>The devs promise "multiple paths through gang territories, wastelands, and more" to help keep things fresh, in addition to weapons ranging from fists of fury, to fully automatic rifles, massive snipers, and explosives. The likes of flamethrowers, miniguns, and futuristic  beam or plasma shooters look to await those who rise up the killer toaster ranks.</p>
<p>"This hits a sweet spot for me," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huntdown-preview-retro-game">2017 preview</a> of the first Huntdown. "On one level, it's not a particularly exciting game, doing things that I've been familiar with for a long time and lacking any specific hook. But at another level, it's one of those retro games that's actually far more detailed than any of the things that it remembers. As I was talking to the developer, I suddenly remembered a 'similar looking' game called After The War that I hadn't thought about since I was a kid. 'It's the same kind of future world, though in After The War a nuclear bomb has been dropped', I explained as I searched the internet for an image."</p>
<p>Huntdown: Overtime's scheduled to drop in early access in Q2 2026, which'd put in somewhere between April 1st and June 30th by my googling. If you fancy, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473350/HUNTDOWN_OVERTIME/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>
One of the nicer Industry Trends of the past few years has been the rise and rise and rise of climbing sims. It turns out climbing is a source of many emotions, from the melancholy wonder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> through the savage loneliness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> to the slapstick camaraderie of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> and the agony of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-a-game-about-eternal-punishment-and-frustration-is-tired-of-playtesting-it">various Sisyphus sims</a>. Also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. And I guess we should mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> here? See, it's an absolute avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is on the somber side. Created by The Game Bakers, it's about a woman with bandaged legs and a scuttling robo buddy. She's trying to reach the top of a mysterious mountain, with a selection of routes to choose from and a backpack inventory to manage. I get the sense that there's more up there than goats, snow and the tents of fellow climbers. We will find out shortly, for Cairn is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">on sale now on Steam</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Nic (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-the-demo-for-heavy-breathing-open-world-mountain-climber-cairn-now">impressed by the Cairn demo</a> back in December 2024, even though the leg animations gave him funny emotions. Fortunately, Nic's funny emotions make for entertaining reading.
</p>
<p>
"No graceful, contextual, restrictive animations for Cairn," he wrote. "No sirree! You'll also be carefully balancing your supplies, and using pitons as quick checkpoints as you make your ascent. You'll be thinking about things like posture, effort and balance while climbing. 'Each wall feels like a boss fight,' says Steam. Do...the mountains do the spinny FromSoft thing? I'd love that."
</p><p>
I do wonder how much of today's flourishing climbing genre is a delayed reaction against the success of Assassin's Creed - the game that 'fixed' videogame climbing back in the noughties by transforming it into a fluid spectacle of semi-automated ledge grabs and cornering. Remember videogame climbing before Assassin's Creed? It was all vikings doing pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake at murky vine textures. Still, there's only so many synchronisation towers you can auto-parkour before you want to get your fingertips dusty again.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is another change of tune for The Game Bakers, hitherto known for the nimble RPG snogging of Haven and the gimlet-eyed boss-rushing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a>. Also the *squints* cephalopoddy eco activism of Squids Odyssey. What will they bake for us next? A martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant? It's a martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant, isn't it. I am giving The Game Bakers 24 hours to deny this, before I write it up as a news story.
