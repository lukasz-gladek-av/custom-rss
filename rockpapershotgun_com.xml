            <p>To suddenly make a leviathan 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> free to play the day before the weekend is either an act of historic generosity or a masterstroke of cruelty. My dear friends at Paradox Interactive, I have literally just sent Nic my contributions to this weekend's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">What Are We All Playing</a> round-up. And now, sirs and madams, you would have me reckon with approximately a century's worth of densely tabulated imperialism, optional child labour and people called Leopold. </p>
<p>Not only have I popped my monocle, sirs and madams, but my top hat has gone off like a volcano and my handlebar mustache has twisted itself into a pair of propellers, which are now flying me away into the sunset. I bid you good evening, sirs and madams! I say again: good evening and good night!</p> <!--more-->
<p>The giveaway <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/550115608635644077?l=english">runs till 23rd June on Steam</a>, and only applies to Victoria 3's base game. You will need to buy the whole thing if you want to play beyond that window. It coincides with the launch of the Chambers Of Commerce DLC. Yes, this is the familiar Paradox gambit of enticing punters with a timed freebie, then burying them in paid expansions, like, I don't know, Queen Victoria shoving Gladstone's head down the toilet for proposing universal male suffrage.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">had words with the publishers last year</a> about the often-heard claim that Paradox are in the habit of releasing games 'unfinished', then charging for expansions that add key mechanics. They said they were "trying to find a middle ground", while acknowledging that it was a "fail" to release Victoria 3, specifically, without a proper warfare system.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of a chunky military component, Victoria 3 appears to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/victoria-3-review">solid work</a>. Back in 2022, our reviewer Caelyn Ellis called it "a warts and all take on a tumultuous period in history" and "a surprisingly thought-provoking experience", not least for how it handles the whole British Empire thing. OK, Paradox, I have talked myself into trying it now. Witness me returning from the sky, whiskers whirring, exploded top hat held penitentially in one hand.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Here's what I'd write on mine</p>

            <p>While prowling the ramparts of this year's Summer Game Fest, I rode a zipline to a broken attic window and snuck into a sealed chamber containing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick As Thieves</a>, the unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> Thief game from Otherside Entertainment. Also in the sealed chamber: celebrated Looking Glass dude and Deus Exman Warren Spector, who walked us through a hands-off demo of the PvPvE heisting sim.</p>
<p>I didn't, if I'm honest, see much that wasn't broadly covered by Jeremy Peel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">write-up of Thick As Thieves from last December</a>. As such, I'm in two minds about whether to do a full impressions piece - this news article is testing the waters. But I did turn up a few objects of novelty. For one, the new multiplayer burgling sim features an ability that lets you pose temporarily as an NPC, as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/semblance">Semblance</a> power in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>: Death Of The Outsider. For another, it turns out that when you rob a joint, you can leave a knavish calling card for other players hunting the same treasure. </p>
<p>It's possible, Spector told me, that you'll be able to customise your calling cards, beyond just displaying your player alias. Being a fundamentally vindictive person, I already have a few ideas for what I'd write on mine.</p>
<blockquote><p>[placeholder]</p>
<p>The earlier bird caught the worm.</p>
<p>The second mouse did not get the cheese.</p>
<p>The third anteater did not bag the swag.</p>
<p>The fourth raccoon did not scoop the loot.</p>
<p>You snoozed and you losed.</p>
<p>Opportunity knocked.</p>
<p>The real treasure was hopefully the friends you made along the way.</p>
<p>IOU one quest reward</p>
<p>Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll.</p>
<p>Behind you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, a topic like this demands the attention of the full Treehouse. I asked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-hello-to-mark-warren-rpss-new-senior-staff-writer">recently recruited</a> newsfiend Mark what he'd put on his card, and he suggested transcribing the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria37d9mInY">this Seinfield video</a> into the textbox. James, our hardware Gandalf, came back with "didn't expect weak foe". Reviews reassembler Brendy had the pithiest and, I think, most obnoxious proposal: "first".</p>
<p>But you, reader dear - what would you leave on your catburgling calling card?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
