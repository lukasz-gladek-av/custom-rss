Space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> has received another update jam-packed with the kind of systemic adjustments that, were you to shout them through your bedroom door at your mum, would cause her to smile shakily, then go downstairs and sob into a tea towel at the knowledge that her treasured child, her brightest and best, will never amount to anything useful, for they are too busy obsessing over ringworlds and genesis arks and xeno-compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
Mum! MUM. I've just heard that "Storm Aftermath events will no longer happen in systems where you are constructing megastructures"! Even better, "Evolutionary Predator Empires can now once more gain and keep the Psionic Ephase trait"! Christmas has come early, mum! The eagle has landed! MOTHER, LOOK AT ME. I will not be denied.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Storm Aftermath-fixing update in question, Stellaris patch 4.0.21, accompanies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502828352450592822?l=english">a cautionary note from game director Stephen "Eladrin" Muray</a>, who says that developers Paradox Interactive are planning to slow down the rate of Stellaris patching in the wake of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">4.0 update</a>, because they keep accidentally lighting whole planets on fire. It turns out the old Zuck mantra "move fast and break things" only gets you so far when you're troubleshooting galaxies.
</p>
<p>
"We've released a tremendous number of patches since then at a rapid rate - but our patch cadence has become problematic (and even counterproductive) in some ways," Muray writes. "Too often in game development, fixing one bug introduces another - and I haven't been giving our internal QA testers enough time to fully vet and test the changes we've been making. 
</p>
<p>
"Examples from recent patches include a few weeks ago when an unrelated fix to a pop issue caused Wilderness empires to seemingly randomly destroy themselves by killing all of their biomass, or when another fix just after that caused save games to corrupt and become unloadable," he goes on.
</p>
<p>
Paradox remain "committed" to patching Stellaris, which has sunk to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">a Mixed Steam user review consensus</a> following the release of the apparently cataclysmic 4.0 update, but they'll be "taking a more measured and deliberate approach to allow internal testing to catch up while giving you a more stable environment to play the game in". 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, they're shifting the emphasis to open betas that bring together QA work and player feedback more organically - the first of these will be updated "on a weekly to fortnightly basis depending on internal progress throughout the summer", with "the next 4.0.x live release" due sometime in August. Muray suggests that modders who "have been waiting for a moment of stability" take advantage of the shortage of major changes during that period.
</p>
<p>
As for what exactly they'll be patching next, please summon your mother back upstairs, for it is once again time to defeat and confuse her with the kind of preposterous sci-fantasy jargon she never ever imagined her darling baby would ever learn, back when you were just a wee tyke nuzzling at the nipple.
</p>
<p>
"I'm personally currently looking at ways to improve the AI's behavior," Muray continues. "Other things currently in active development are OOS investigations, a number of strata issues that affect slavery, purging, and other oddities among pop employment, and more of a design change rather than a bugfix - based on your feedback we're looking at having newly grown pops go straight into the Civilian stratum or its appropriate equivalent instead of being unemployed members of their parent pop group. 
</p>
<p>
"While we liked the verisimilitude of top-heavy planets having more stability issues than ones that were more evenly developed, we acknowledge that having a persistent trickle of unemployed pops feels wrong," Muray continues.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, mum? He took the words right out of my mouth. Mother, will you stop weeping and fetch me my abacus so I can calculate the performance losses from the bug "where every empire was calculating their Biomass total far too often". No, I do not want to speak to the careers advisor again. Yes, I will be eating dinner in my room this evening.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developers Funcom have revealed in a post-launch Reddit AMA that they're currently aiming to release a fresh update full of quality of life-related tweaks in early July, as well as adding "new contracts across the board" down the line.</p>
<p>However, if you're after big new stuff to do, you'll have to wait for the major updates that'll be releasing alongside the game's DLCs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have an update in testing that contains a lot of quality of life updates, which we are aiming to release in early July," DA executive producer Scott Junior wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">in response</a> to a question about Funcom's immediate future plans, "When we get closer to it being publicly testable we will release the full patch notes. It contains too many changes for me to list here, but you'll be seeing it soon!"</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say there's a chance that update includes simple base building tweaks folks have been begging for, such as storage containers and vehicles you can name, as well as the option to deposit all of their water with one button press. All of those were confirmed as being in the works at different points in the thread.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in terms of bigger additions to the game, Junior explained: "each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out. Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months."</p>
<p>In terms of what the developer's plans are to tweak PvP, which has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/dune-awakening-devs-promise-a-bunch-of-changes-as-the-survival-mmos-pvp-and-endgame-content-come-under-fire-over-loot-balance-concerns-and-more-total-mess/">come under fire</a> from players early doors, DA senior game director Viljar Sommerbakk wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">scout ornithopter</a> won't be losing its rockets, with the devs instead instead aiming to make its performance vary depending on what gear you equip it with.</p>
<p>In line with that, specifically in terms of deep desert PvP, Sommerbakk said the devs are currently "formulating a plan" for changes based around three considerations. They want players to have to make "meaningful decisions" about their loadouts, the mode to feel "reliable, responsive, and clearly understood" moment to moment, and are fixing "issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability".</p>
<p>One of the major things players asked about in the thread was the possibility of the game getting more contracts for PvE folks to work through on a weekly basis, rather than running out of stuff to do. "There are plans to add new contracts across the board," wrote DA creative director Joel Bylos, "In addition, the Landsraad itself is supposed to involve more contracts in order to reveal tasks for the Houses. As well as contracts that lead into the Deep Desert."</p>
<p>In terms of the Landsraad, the devs were also clear they've read feedback about issues like tasks locking early or being too tough for solo players, and plan to rectify those as well as making sure folks feel like its rewards are worth the work.</p>
<p>As for folks missing out on Landsraad tasks that are claimed not long after they're released, Bylos replied that Funcom's "current plan is to allow your contributions to stack week after week, so that small groups and solos can work towards larger rewards over time. And then adding more tiers of rewards as well as new activity drivers".</p>
<p>It's a lot of spicy stuff to be sure. Funcom definitely aren't shying away from the raging sandworms of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">player opinion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mike Klubnika's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> was a simple, harrowing game about aiming a shotgun at your very own face and praying for a click, not a bang, then challenging a manky git across the table to do likewise. The developer's forthcoming s.p.l.i.t, by contrast, looks like a squirming snakepit of moving parts that calls to mind both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

In this "short psychological horror game", you are part of a team of hackers attempting to break into "an unethical superstructure". The whole thing appears to unfold in a small, grubby room full of crackling monitors, with despairing trees visible through a curtained window. Your job is to poke at a command prompt interface while bandying words with shadowy strangers over IRC. The below trailer is already giving me a migraine. I can feel my guts uncoiling in protest. How very glorious.

"The facility you and your crew infiltrate is a superstructure of unethical electronics," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3684610/split/">Steam page</a> adds. "The daunting task is only made possible by careful planning, and vulnerabilities hidden deep below legacy code and engineering." Be warned that the game will contain depictions of self-harm and suicide. That noose in the picture seemingly isn't just for show.
</p>
<p>
Alice O, greatest of news editors, is a fan of Klubnika's work. "I really like how his games are small visits to unexplained terrible places," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">wrote back in 2024</a>, shortly before she quit this stinking james gournalism business and, as legend tells, escaped to the mountains in a hamster-powered balloon.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure s.p.l.i.t. will be similarly dense and anomalous, and as such, I'm prepared to forgive the Tom Clancy-ass title punctuation here. Perhaps the abbreviation stands for "Send Pizza Lest I Tunnel (Past Your Network Security)"? We'll find out when the game hits e-shelves on 24th July. If you'd rather play more Buckshot Roulette, know that it now has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buckshot-roulette-now-has-a-4-person-multiplayer-mode-which-im-sure-you-will-survive">four-person multiplayer mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
