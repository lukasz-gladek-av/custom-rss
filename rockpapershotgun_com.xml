It is an incredibly difficult thing to sell someone on a game in just one sentence. What are you meant to focus on, genre, specific mechanics, an interesting element of the story? There's not a right answer! I'm not going to figure out a recipe for success right here and now, but what I can do is at least show you a single sentence that sold me on a game called Burden Street Station quite quickly: "A surreal, narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game where you shapeshift during conversations to uncover how God went missing."
</p>
<p>
A stunner of a line! The concept of God going missing and the implication that it is your responsibility to figure it out says a tremendous amount in a few words. I know the genre, a narrative adventure game, and there is even a hint towards mechanics, the shapeshifting element. Personally, that's all I need to be convinced, but we'll dig deeper all the same.

A surreal game where you mostly help all sorts of freaks come to terms with the fact that god no longer exists.
and you'll get to know more about it it very, very soon.

DEMO COMING TO STEAM TOMORROW. WE WILL BE WAITING.

In the world of Burden Street Station, moments from the lives of mortals, be they good or bad, are taken and turned into sentient books, which in turn get sold to Gods for the same reason you and I read books, entertainment. Except in your particular world, the production of these books stops in its tracks, and its God vanishes. So you, alongside one of those sentient books, must talk to the people of this world to figure out what the hell went down.
</p><p>
There's an apparent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> influence here, and an overall '90s PC adventures game vibe, alongside more modern series like ENA. Mechanically, you can change different parts of your body throughout your conversations with mortals to produce different dialogue options, some of which look suitably irreverent and sarcastic, the epitome of '90s conversations.
</p>
<p>
Apparently a demo for it will be available tomorrow, December 2nd, so let's all agree to log on to Steam and give it a go, yeah? Or at least wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126340/Burden_Street_Station/">here</a> in the meantime.

            <p>
Around May last year, the one and only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/ron-gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">Monkey Island</a> fame announced an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that was meant to be some kind of mix between classic Zelda, and Diablo, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, that last one being another of the game designer's notable works. It never got a full reveal, or even a name, and unfortunately it seems it never will, as it's essentially been canned.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert recently spoke with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Ars Technica</a> about his career, including his most recently released game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ron-gilberts-new-death-by-scrolling-rpg-about-never-ending-grind-and-the-absurdity-of-social-media-is-out-now">Death by Scrolling</a>, which just launched this October, but the interview kicks off by discussing his unnamed RPG. The designer explained that after working on adventure games like Thimbleweed Park and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> for a good many years, he was "thinking about something new."
</p>
<p>
That something new resulted in Gilbert hiring an artist and another designer, putting a year's worth of time into the aforementioned RPG. The problem? Not enough people, and as is the case with most of life, not enough money. "I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained. "You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."
</p>
<p>
For Gilbert, bringing in funds was tougher than he thought it would be. He tried pitching the game to various places, but "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible." He continued, "Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in.' The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."
</p><p>
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter don't work so well these days either, as Gilbert's Thimbleweed Park also went that route, and while it wracked up more than $600,000, the game dev noted that it still had private investors providing half of the game's final budget.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly just another reminder that making games isn't just hard because they're technically complex, but they have material necessities that can't always be met due to external forces. Would be nice if someone did something about that. Revolution anyone?
