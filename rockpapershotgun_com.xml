            <p>Around the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release, the Metroidvania's Simplified Chinese translation was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit stilted</a>, with Team Cherry quickly promising to rectify the "quality issues". They've aimed to take the first step in doing just that with the game's fourth patch, which is now live in Steam beta with a fresh translation, but early impressions from players are largely negative.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to Team Cherry, they have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/">made clear</a> that the fresh translation which has arrived with the beta release of patch 1.0.28954 is a "basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback". They added that "implementation of this new translation is not yet finalised, so please expect some display issues throughout." There's a <a href="https://teamcherry.notion.site/12c63da3a1a780f4a8cfd8441a243a6e">bug report form</a> via which folks can leave feedback on the revamped wordage.</p>
<p>A fair few Chinese players have also opted to leave early feedback on the translation in comments on the patch post, and these verdicts are far from glowing. While it seems the original translation's classical grammar might be gone (though the comments offer mixed views on that), fresh problems are being reported, with place and NPC names seeming like the main sticking point this time around. The Deep Docks in particular <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/#c506216918921801406">are cited</a> as now being referred to by a spoliery name.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your efforts in translating Chinese," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=4#c506216918921814502">one of these comments</a>. "I have always been a fan of yours, but the new beta version of the translation has obvious shortcomings. The main problem is that the new translation version has changed the translations of place names and NPC characters that were originally well translated and recognised by most players. I hope the new version of the translation can keep the original NPC and place name translations, and make the dialogue and background introduction text more readable and understandable."</p><p>Team Cherry have been quick to acknowledge this initial feedback. "Thanks so much to everyone who's been sending in comments and concerns on the Simplified Chinese translation in public-beta," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=5#c506216918921817500">comment of their own</a>. "They've been a huge help. Two quick notes from us: We fully agree with comments that the names of characters, places etc, should generally remain the same as in the original version. Only a few specific names should be considered appropriate to change - those where the current translation is confusing or incorrect. We won't be releasing any translation that isn't up to the community's standards, and we'll continue to closely monitor feedback from fans."</p>
<p>Outside of this revamped translation, this beta version of patch four features a "short set of game fixes", set to be added to before full release. Among them are a switch to Unity's input system aimed at improving controller support and an update to the multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots.</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry are able to get a handle on these persistent translation problems soon.</p>
