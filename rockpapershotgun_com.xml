A frustrating thing I frequently find myself thinking about games is that they very rarely try to be more than what they are, at least when it comes to AAA ones (or any kind of game that has enough money for a full blown ad campaign). They're just so often… games. No interest or desire to expand the medium. Luckily, there are people doing the work to rethink what games are, and today we now have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, a "semi-autobiographical", almost documentary-like game about playing football in Ecuador in 2001.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game follows an eight year old Julián Cordero, one of the lead developers on the game, as he kicks about a football throughout Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Now, I'll be honest, I care about football about as far as I can throw one (it's not very far). That doesn't matter very much to me though because, from the looks of it, Despelote shows a connection to the beautiful game that anyone could get invested in.
</p>
<p>
Kicking around the football is all physics based too, it looks so satisfying just punting it off into the distance. The look of the game is impressive too. It has this filter to it that makes everything look like it's a photo that's been put through one of those free filters that comes with some camera app. I don't mean this derogatorily in any way, there's such a strong sense of texture to it that somehow makes it feel real and surreal at the same time. Exactly my kind of vibe.
</p>
<p>
All of the photos and audio in the game were apparently recorded on location, which is probably why Despelote looks to have such a strong look to it. This is what I'm talking about with expanding the medium. Autobiographical games aren't all too common, it joins works like Cibele and That Dragon Cancer in a very small niche, but I hope that more people consider doing the same.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote on Steam now</a>, and there's even a 10% launch discount until May 15th.

You know, at this point I'm not sure if games, or even just aspects of games, that rely on licensing other works, is really all that good of an idea. It's probably part of why there are some Fortnite skins you never see in the shop anymore, it's absolutely why the Friday the 13th game shut down, and I have a hunch that that's what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>. Recently, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game disappeared from both the PlayStation Store and Epic Games Store, leading to a bit of confusion as to its status. Now, the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> have put out a comment addressing the situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," wrote Saber in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam post</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
My guess is that despite only being a three year old game, it hasn't done well enough to keep it going, and something related to licensing out the Evil Dead universe has fallen through. I honestly can't tell you, and I doubt Saber will confirm anything, so your guess is as good as mine. None of this is surprising though, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-dead-the-game-studio-halts-development-of-new-content-just-16-months-after-launch-but-servers-will-stay-up-for-now">new content for the game was stopped back in 2023</a>, only 16 months after the game launched.
</p>
<p>
The fact that servers are still being kept online is a welcome surprise, but ultimately the game's death warrant has been signed. Obviously the irony of a game with the word dead in its title dying like this isn't lost on me. You don't need to post your witty "Evil Dead game" comments, I'm one step ahead of you.

I really quite like how simple a title <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratopia">Ratopia</a> has. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategic</a> survival city builder, where you have to build a nice place for rats to live. Ratopia! It gets straight to the heart of it, and it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2244130/view/538852710067208196?l=english">just received its 1.0 release today</a> after an early access period of 18 months. The game has had a lengthy development time too, starting way back in 2020, and in a Steam post discussing the 1.0 release, developers Cassel Games left a nice and lengthy list covering everything that's been added across its early access release.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That includes things like a diplomacy system, character customisation, even a disease system, which does make me sad, but rats are generally known for being carriers of all sorts. In terms of gameplay, there's definitely a bit of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> vibe to it given that your rats walk around 2D landscapes, digging at squares to build settlements. All the rats apparently have their "own wealth and unique characteristics", though, I have to say, developing capitalism but for rats doesn't seem very utopic.

<p>
This 1.0 update also adds in a new leader perk system, which offers, you guessed it, perks for your leader rat. That can be for things like recovering health at certain times of day, or to help you cultivate plants. Those that like to tweak their challenge to suit them have some new options to tweak things like choosing which kinds of enemies invade, changing the season order, or just outright turning crime off. There's the utopia I'm looking for!
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more than that too, and Cassel Games did say that they plan to release more updates in the future too, as well as Steam Deck improvements. It's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244130/Ratopia/">currently 20% off</a>, which technically is just keeping it at it's early access price more or less, so you've got until May 14th to get it slightly cheaper than you will pass that point. Oh, and there's a demo too! Lots of options for you.
