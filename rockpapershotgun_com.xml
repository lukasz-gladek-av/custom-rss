            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> just got a fresh patch, and it's come with a free cape (not a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">review bomb cape</a>, mind you) that folks who took part in the battle for Super Earth can wear to prove they played a part in the victory. Stick it on your back, and maybe think about showing it off in the glitzy glow of the spotlights the patch adds to Leviathans.</p>
<p>Seriously, I promise doing that last bit won't precede the flying squid things immediately zapping you to death. Ok, maybe it will.</p>

<p>Taking a look through the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/580514905803724132?l=english">Patch 01.003.103</a>, Arrowhead have outlined that the Battle for Super Earth commemorative cape will be dished out to everyone who's logged into the game at some point in the past 60 days and played between May 13th and June 2nd. It's dubbed "Protector of the Heart", and looks pretty swanky provided you're into rocking a big white outline of a planet, accompanied by some gold flourishes.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, the most noteworthy tweak looks to be the addition of spotlights to Leviathans alongside a reduction of their sight range, in order to give players a bit more notice they they're in the firing line. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldiomm/new_leviathan_spotlights/">this Reddit post</a> demonstrates, those who don't heed the signal to dive out of the way get to stand bathed in light for a few seconds before being death rayed into the great Fascist afterlife.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>COMMEMORATIVE CAPE ISSUED</p><p>A cape has been issued commemorating the defense of Super Earth from hostile, evil, and threateningly unknowable alien forces. This cape represents the boundless gratitude of all citizens for the Helldivers' selfless and innumerable sacrifices. <a href="https://t.co/CVMPPKIXdz">pic.twitter.com/CVMPPKIXdz</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1934940086593810566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Why not take advantage and whip out an inspirational emote so the moment of your death is immortalised in the rest of your squad's minds forever? Sure, John got instakilled by a sneaky squid snipe, they'll recall to their grandkids, but he died miming the tipping of an imaginary cowboy hat.</p>
<p>The other enemy tweak is an increase to the health of Mega Shrieker nests in order to make sure you've got to be more resourceful to crush the bugs. The patch also delivers a bunch of bug fixes and tweaks, including a bunch to the Warrant pistol from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">Force of Law warbond</a> and some that ensure the Borderline Justice warbond armours match their stats.</p>
<p>Arrowhead's even made sure planting the Super Earth flag via the One True Flag stratagem "would cause objective items to clip through the ground".</p>
<p>The game's latest major order, a fight against some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">urban Terminid invasions</a>, is set to end today. So, we'll have to see where the caped-up defenders of Super Earth are sent next.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
