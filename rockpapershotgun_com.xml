            <p>Despite the best efforts of all concerned, there are once again new PC games this week. See how they frolic among the days ahead, trampling all over our life commitments and need for tranquility like boisterous, fugitive oxen. Please equip yourself with a broom, weighted net and klaxon and help me herd them back into the pens, for proper disassembly. Here are a few I've rounded up already.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546740/Champions_Tactics_Reforged/">Champions Tactics Reforged</a> may yet prove a routine turn-based PvP battler, but it does have exceptionally handsome tabletop figurines. The kind of thing I wish I'd been able to paint back when I played Mordheim.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 20th May</h2>
<li>Here be some "Enhanced" editions of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427410/STALKER_Shadow_of_Chornobyl__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chornobyl</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427420/STALKER_Clear_Sky__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427430/STALKER_Call_of_Prypiat__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call Of Prypiat</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-siege-and-the-sandfox">The Siege and the Sandfox</a> is a sidescrolling stealth metroidvania affair with some moderately bewitching pixelart visuals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumping-jazz-cats">Jumping Jazz Cats</a> is a feline racing game, if such a thing can be credited.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/">Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer</a> is a private-eyeful of point-and-click, involving a serial killer and a biker detective.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 21st May</h2>
<li> Twoot twoot! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> is pulling up to the station with another confusing payload of tower defence and roguelite deck-building.</li>
<h2>Thursday 22nd May</h2>
<li>Break the traditional construction grid in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265070/City_Tales__Medieval_Era/">City Tales - Medieval Era</a>, out this day in early access.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is about barging through a 1950s toy-town in the style of a GTA game. I played about 40 minutes at an event last year and found it a bit shrugworthy, but the scenery is nice.</li>
<li>Sure, go on then - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown">a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tactics RPG</a> from Clickolding and I Am Your Beast outfit Strange Scaffold.</li>

<h2>Friday 23rd May</h2>
<li>Did you miss the original Onimusha 2? It's back with new controls and gossamer HD visuals in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a> is about using cards to build kingdoms, and hurling rocks at armies.</li>
<li>Let's make it two detective game reccs this week. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714620/Duck_Detective_The_Ghost_of_Glamping/">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> asks you to "throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice". Commendable!</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, James has been making forbidding noises about Computex 2025, the latest appalling rebirth of the Taipei, Taiwan-based tech show. Expect a few headlines with unpronounceable acronyms in them, and probably a lot of unreportable guff about genAI. Speaking of events: I'm attending Summer Games Fest for RPS in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying to clear out a few features before I'm deluged in fresh interview material.</p>
<p>Nic and Brendy are juggling various review commitments, like brilliant hell jesters on unicycles. Graham is forming terrible plans and chewing his way through another stack of freelance edits. Ollie continues his quest to write a complete instruction manual for all of existence, aka our guides section, and Jeremy is still blissfully on holiday. What are you up to this week? Playing anything fun?</p>

            <p>Pro tip: if you send RPS an email of your game with the hook "I know you like goofy stuffâ€¦" then, yes, there's a decent chance I'll take the bait, mirth-parched wanderer in the endless dessert left by a goofphagic modernity as I am. Titanic Re-Christened: Maiden Vengeance is almost unplayable in my browser - it can't seem to decide whether I'm clicking on the game on the itch.io page itself - but I'm writing about it anyway because it made my morning coffee a couple of mild chuckles better than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You play a strapped, bipedal Titanic out to get revenge on the icebergs that sunk it, with a large selection of guns, including a sniper rifle named 'Molly's Greetings' and an Uzi named 'The White Star Special'. When you kill sunglass-wearing iceberg minions, the Titanic will spout one-liners like "I'm back and full of steam" and "your assault on me was glacially motivated". It is awful and I believe the world is a better place for its existence.</p>
<p>Here's the lore:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Titanic has sat motionless on the Atlantic Ocean floor for over 100 years...until now.</p>
<p>A cursed wine bottle dropped in the ocean by a ship passing overhead sinks to the depths and smashes open against the skeletal hull of the ghost ship, re-christening it, and bringing it back to life. Gaining sentience for the first time, the Titanic realizes it has an insatiable thirst for one thing: revenge.</p>
<p>Guide the unsinkable ship through the iceberg stronghold and gather the four smokestacks in order to summon your old nemesis, the iceberg that put you 12,500 feet deep in the freezing ocean in April 1912.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can, ostensibly, play it for free in your <a href="https://andymetoo.itch.io/titanic-re-christened-maiden-vengeance">browser via itch.io here.</a> Me? I've been doing this so long I no longer have to play games to know if they're good or not. This one isn't, by the way, but it is <em>art</em>. Actually, it's not really that either. But it is <em>stupid</em>. And there is no better encapsulation of man's eternal hubris than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
