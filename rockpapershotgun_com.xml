            <p>Survival hellscape <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rust">Rust</a> has added a tropical jungle biome to its procedurally generated maps, the biggest change to the landscape of the game in nine years. It'll appear close to where new players spawn and hides a number of threats and fun. Poisonous snakes will skitter through the undergrowth and riverside crocs will chew your face given the chance. There are ruins and temples hidden among the trees, housing some basic loot. And you can swing from vines, perhaps inspiring a whole new life in the canopy. Probably for the best, considering there are now tigers and panthers stalking the ground below.</p>

<p>Developers Facepunch detailed all the changes in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252490/view/498319683381887523">update post on Steam</a>. Maps are still procedurally generated (they've been this way since the nudist murder sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-new-version-review">moved to Unity 5 in 2016</a>) but until now maps have been basically a mix of arctic, temperate, and desert biomes. So this does seem a significant new addition to the deadly dog-eat-dog dangerzone. </p>
<p>To help out with that, there are two new weapons: a boomerang that returns to the player, and a blowpipe "for those who enjoy causing problems quietly." It can be loaded up with different types of dart ammo, including an "incapacitate" dart that slows its victims and obscures their vision for a time. Or a "radiation" dart that simply stacks radioactive ill-health onto your foe. Hideous behaviour, and not one bit surprising for Rust. The new wildlife sounds equally brutal. </p>

<p>"The tiger may be the deadliest animal you'll ever encounter [in] Rust," say the devs. "It closes in extremely slowly from behind, and only strikes when it's sure to kill. A moment of inattention in the jungle is all it takes."</p>
<p>To make sure that enemy's AI doesn't feel "unfair and bullshit," the animal will have a set of cues that you have to watch and listen for while roaming the fern-ridden floor. "It'll be on you to experiment and discover those hidden signals."</p>
<p>The overgrown temples (an ancient ziggurat, for example) will hide some mysteries, we're told. And slightly less weathered ruins will contain "low-tier supplies and maybe even a few surprises tucked away". The place is also a botanist's delight, from the sounds of things.</p>
<p>"The jungle biome features a large variety of completely new foliage," they say. "This includes new types of bushes, such as bromeliads and monstera. New undergrowth plants like arrowroot and calathea. As well as [a] variety of new trees like trumpet trees, jungle palms and sandbox trees. The biggest of them all are enormous kapok trees that you will be able to climb and swing from." </p>

<p>There's a bunch of other stuff accompanying the update (here's the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/jungle-update">full patch notes</a>), including beefing up of servers, and a DLC pack with an Aztec-flavoured AK-47. If only Moctezuma had had one of these... </p>
<p>I'm not going back to Rust, even with all this lush-looking leaf rendering. I haven't visited its randogen den of misdeeds in over a decade, when I chronicled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-diary">a nine-life misadventure</a> with its chaotic players. But even I can see the game has changed a huge amount since then, adding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-adds-boasts">boats</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-next-dlc-pack-adds-pools-tubes-and-water-guns">water pistols</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-has-submarines-spearguns-and-sharks-now">submarines</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusts-new-instruments-dlc-lets-you-shred-the-shovel-bass">musical instruments</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-now-has-npcs-who-can-give-you-missions">NPC quest-givers</a>, and even - oh my god - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rust-is-finally-adding-backpacks-to-kick-off-its-second-decade">backpacks</a>. No wonder it remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>. If you're made of sturdier stuff than I, this could be a good time to go camping. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Oblivion remaster art lead is "excited to see their interpretation"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is theoretically terrible news for the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, a long-in-development mod that recreates Bethesda's 2006 RPG in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> engine. On the one hand, you could argue that the official comeback care of Virtuos Studios renders Skyblivion unnecessary. On the other, there's the usual worry that Bethesda's intellectual property lawyers are going to erupt from the toilets like radioactive rats and eat the modders alive.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion crew professed themselves undaunted by the news, however. "This always was a passion project and still is until the end," modder KRebel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-get-twice-the-amount-of-oblivion-this-year-says-skyblivion-modder-undeterred-by-official-remaster">insisted last week</a>. "For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year." And Bethesda have now met them with open arms by not only declining to sue the pants off Skyblivion for intellectual property infringement, but handing the modders keys for the official remaster and even going on camera to say that they're looking forward to Skyblivion's release.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Even though I worked on Oblivion Remastered, I'm still excited for Skyblivion," art and development lead Dan Lee comments in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_vxm8svHko">video</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesda-gives-full-throated-shout-out-to-skyblivion-fan-remake-after-giving-the-whole-dev-team-free-oblivion-remastered-keys-i-think-what-theyre-doing-is-very-special/">Passable Crumpet Gamer</a>. "I think what they're doing is very special, and I'm excited to see their interpretation of what we've done in the past. I think it's a great year for Oblivion fans." In case there was any lingering ambiguity about Bethesda's goodwill, the video closes with some footage of the mod.</p>
<p>The Skyblivion team are naturally very happy about this. "Dan, we're just as excited to get Skyblivion into your hands this year as you are to play it!" they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3lo4pnqtszs2h">write on Bluesky</a>. "Thanks for the shout-out and kind words."</p>
<p>All this is being greeted online as a rare dollop of wholesome vibes from publishers that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/28/17511658/bethesda-lawsuits-fallout-elder-scrolls-prey">have launched their fair share of legal action over copyright infringement</a>. At the risk of being a Cyrodiil Cynic and/or Daedra Downer, I think it could be a mixture of genuine benevolence and Bethesda calculating that Skyblivion poses no real commercial threat to the Oblivion remaster at this juncture, and that being nice to the modders is great publicity. See also: this news post. If only Take Two Interactive thought the same of people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">trying to recreate GTA 6 in the GTA 5 engine</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless, I am interested to compare the visuals of Skyblivion and the official remaster, particularly given James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">conclusions about the latter's performance</a>, and Nic's comments in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review</a> about how the extra graphicsability only emphasises Oblivion's capacity for silliness. As he puts it: "by whacking up the verisimilitude dial, by making you believe that much more in every flickering flame or dancing shadow or rapturous sunrise, everything that actually occurs in Cyrodiil becomes that much stupider."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Photo Of God is not an especially brilliant game, but it is a game I keep thinking about. It's a spooky, throwaway interactive epistle from the evidently self-deprecating Serious Daniel, in which you play a photographer standing on a rooftop in a flooded city, under a low, funereal sun. The photographer decides he is going to snap a picture of God. To do this, he must first take pictures of birds that form a breadcrumb trail around the rooftop and through an abandoned building, lit by blazing oil drums. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear whether the abandoned building is the same one you start on. There appear to be several floors but, perhaps due to the fade-outs when you enter the stairs, it feels more like you're repeatedly traversing one hallway, with objects shuffling around behind your back. It makes sense that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> about the joy and hubris of photographing a deity would complicate the notion of ascending or descending, that it would feel innately purgatorial. For every photograph you take, the photographer rambles to himself a little about beauty and divinity.
</p>
<p>
The birds, meanwhile, spawn one after the other, each cycling the same animation of cocking its head and pecking at the lurid, featureless environment. They appear indifferent to your presence until you snap a photo, using right-click to aim through the lens. Then, there's another fade-to-black and the sound of flapping wings and when the blackness lifts, the bird has vanished. You could call the inability to watch it fly away evidence of limited technical expertise or resources, but again, these crude ruptures feel appropriate. Cameras cut the world to pieces, whereas godhood is (going by the Judeo-Christian concepts I grew up with) continuous, all-pervading. Even when not seeking deliberately to visualise the deity, snapping a photograph is chopping God's body apart.
</p>
<p>
The game lasts a handful of minutes. You will probably guess at the rough nature of conclusion. If you can't, there's a picture of it right there on <a href="https://danieloschepkov.itch.io/the-photo-of-god">the Itch.io page</a>. The Photo Of God is no extended philosophical treatise, but a whimsical modelling of feelings of cosmic dread and presumption that are already perfectly encapsulated by the title alone. There may be a lot more to it or not much at all - I leave that for you to determine. It's free to download.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about the game because you could take the concept and apply it to any vaguely agnostic game with camera mechanics, and it'd be transformative. Imagine if, say, Ubisoft updated callous Clancy fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands">Ghost Recon: Wildlands</a> with a bonus Steam achievement labelled "take a photo of God", with no guidance about what is meant here by God, no actual unlock parameters, and no other changes to the game. Just throw that one out there for the completionists to anguish over, while they're synching headshots. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not religious, as you may guess, but I would spend many enchanted hours in such a game attempting to conceive and envisage godhood through drone feeds, sniper scopes, and the game's own Photo Mode. I would also enjoy reading threads of other people striving to do likewise, according to their own modellings of divinity. We don't need to wait for that Steam achievement. We can start the ball rolling here.
