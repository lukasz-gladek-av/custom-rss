            <p>
Right, anybody fancy a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> update? Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/deep-field-games">Deep Field Games</a> did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one. As you can probably guess by the title of the update, there's a bit of a chill coming, specifically in a new area called the Residence Sector. This new locale has "something" going on that's making it a bit too cold for anyone to hang out in, though the mystery behind it is something you'll likely have to play to discover.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Then there's the new upgrade system that'll come with this update. Once you reach a certain tier you'll be able to build a new station that'll let you improve your weapons, armour, "and a few other item types", which sounds like it'll make certain instances in the game a little less stressful. It also seems like you'll be able to reset your character, and the room you do it in definitely doesn't look cold and unwelcoming.
</p>
<p>
One big thing that will be changing is base assaults, because as Deep Field Games put it, they "kinda stink." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543352686106378315?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing the update explains that while portal storms are generally working as intended, there are "several cases, mostly non-Pest related assaults, where they will simply spawn inside your base or in the same spot over and over." As a result of this, some big changes have been made to how bases are detected, and Deep Field Games are hoping that assaults should feel "a lot more unique and varied."
</p>
<p>
On the smaller end of new additions in the update, and possibly my favourite of everything that's coming with it, is the fact that bins can be used as bins. Got something you don't want? Just chuck it in there! Gotta love it when a game has tiny little functions like this.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when this update will arrive just yet, so we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled in the meantime.

            <p>
You know, I've always loved me a sky island in a video game. Can't really tell you why, I just think they're neat! So right from the get go I was pretty easily won over by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a>, another one of those open world survival crafting type games. It's a genre I'm not easily won over by, I don't care for building things all that much, but the pull of the open air is pretty alluring to me. And I won't even have very long to see if I'll bounce off of its craftiness or not, because developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bossa-studios">Bossa Studios</a> announced today that Lost Skies is releasing into early access later this month on April 18th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Being one of those kinds of games, there's the usual kinds of things you can expect in terms of building things, though the main thing you'll be building is your skyship. It looks pretty intricate too, lots of different parts you can attach and wiggle around. You can then take your ship out on large scale dogfights, which look a bit intimidating to be honest, but I'm sure a seasoned enough crew will be fine.

<p>
Speaking of your crew, you can play with up to five friends (or enemies, I suppose, that just doesn't sound very fun) as you explore the game's first region, the Outskirts. Future updates will apparently expand this area, as well as add in more places to explore, alongside general bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and a few additional features.
</p>
<p>
One thing I quite like is the game's Island Creator, which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/">already download separately</a>. This is exactly what it sounds like, you can build and design your own islands, and in the main game you'll be able to download islands other people have made. Honestly this looks like enough of a game in its own right, kudos to Bossa Studios for fitting something like this in.
</p>
<p>
If you're not an early access person, Bossa Studios said they are currently planning to release it into 1.0 sometime this year, but otherwise, you can check it out April 18th.

I think if you were to show someone the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, complete with cats you-know-whating, a musical number, and a poop joke, they'd probably be taken quite aback. However, if you were to tell them that it's from the same people that made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, I'm sure they'd be able to understand much quicker. Aside from coming from some pretty notable indie devs, there still might be the question of why it's such a big deal that Mewgenics finally got a trailer, and the answer to that is (kind of) simple: it was announced 13 years ago.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Mewgenics was originally meant to be a follow-up to Super Meat Boy, but was technically cancelled in 2016, with one of the main devs behind it, Edmund McMillen leaving Team Meat shortly after. McMillen shared a couple of years later that he acquired the rights to Mewgenics, and would be working on it with Tyler Glaiel. Now, seven years after that, the game actually has a trailer, and is even due to come out sometime in 2025.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Mewgenics - Official Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyWcrDKg9hA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyWcrDKg9hA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Now, does this trailer at all tell you what the game is about? Apart from the fact that you'll breed cats, nope! But that's the pull of marketing, it gets you to explore further. Dig a little deeper (i.e. checking the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Steam page</a>) confirms that yes, it is in fact an "endless cat breeding RPG", but it's also a tactical, turn-based roguelike. It kind of looks like an incredibly unhinged <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a>, but instead of mechs you control cats you've bred to have different abilities. A lot to unpack here!
</p>
<p>
McMillen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@souldescen">personal YouTube channel</a> actually has quite a few gameplay clips to peruse if the nightmare fuel trailer didn't do it for you. There's a real Tom Waits vibe to the music that I wasn't expecting but am fully into, I think I'll be checking this one out whenever it does arrive.

            <p>
It's not exactly much of a secret that a lot of indie devs are struggling to stay afloat these days given the economic *gestures vaguely at a world map.* No one has an exact solution either, but last December, just before the release of its latest game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, noted indie developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/heartmachine">Heart Machine</a> announced that they were opening a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/HeartMachineHQ/home">Patreon</a>. I won't act like this is exactly a novel concept, I've seen a few other devs, typically on the smaller or solo size, try the same thing. But it still felt like a sign that Heart Machine needed a bit of a boost to keep things going.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Heart Machine founder Alx Preston recently spoke with The Verge at GDC about the team's reasoning behind starting the Patreon, offering up some pretty candid explanations. "The Patreon’s there, really, to open up to the community and talk about certain things when it comes to game development," Preston said. "I think there’s still a lot of distance between developers traditionally and the audience that consumes what they make — what we make — so finding ways to dig back in and have a conversation there is important."
</p>
<p>
Obviously, money is a factor too - "Industry dynamics have changed a lot, so money is tough to come by in a lot of ways," Preston said, continuing, "Whatever we can do to support ourselves and stay alive longer term is an important thing to turn to, as well." Preston did make the point that the Patreon isn't a huge piece of the studio's revenue, but if "you keep engaging and keep doing more stuff there, it’s a different model than going to publishers for money all the time."
</p>
<p>
Quite aptly, he said that right now it's the "experimental phase of figuring out what the f*ck works these days." Honestly, power to them for giving something like this ago. Getting a finished game out feels like a bit of a miracle these days, so I hope the extra support does pan out.
</p>
<p>
Right now Heart Machine are working on the aforementioned Hyper Light Breaker, a more live-servicey sequel to 2016's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. When it launched into early access earlier this year, the overall package <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">didn't really work all that well</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Personally I haven't gone back to it since then, I'm waiting on a few more updates to arrive, even if I'm not entirely sold on its radical departure from the original game just yet. The other game it's working on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/possessors-is-a-side-scroller-from-the-folks-behind-hyper-light-drifter">Possessor(s)</a>, might be a bit more up my alley though. Fingers crossed the team can keep things going!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing.1156158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fishing! It's a feature that's been included in many games over the years, one that varies in quality from game to game. Sega Bass Fishing? Probably top of the line, as long as you have that unique fishing rod controller. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>? I like it, but I know plenty of people that hate it. Personally I normally find it quite a relaxing thing to do, particularly in games that are otherwise combat focused. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> is one such game that's more about shooting rather than chilling out, but over on the public test server you can now try out its version of fishing.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Those of you on the PTS (I hear that's what the cool kids call it) can now head to a new area in the boggy Mire region called Fisherman's Rest. There's three new characters here, Captain Raymond Clark, someone literally just called The Fisherman, and Linda-Lee, a giant hermit crab. A likely bunch in a world like Fallout's.
</p>
<p>
To get your probably not brand-spanking-new fishing rod you need to start the Casting Off quest. You'll find that by following a signal on your Pip-Boy in the Mire. A <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server">blog post</a> detailing the fishing patch notes that the way you know if you can fish somewhere is a simple mantra: "If I can swim, then I can fish."
</p>
<p>
When you actually get to fish, you'll need to use different kinds of bait, take weather conditions into consideration - Radstorms will help you find a glowing fish - though I can't tell you how the fishing part actually works other than the fact a fish command comes up in deep bodies of water. Sounds like it might be pretty automatic, which is a bit of a shame.
</p>
<p>
There's lots of different fish to catch, which you can eat to restore some health, but you can also turn them into fish bits (awful name), which lets you cook a new grilled fish recipe. This one "provides you with an effect that reduces the time to hook a fish for 20 minutes," something that feels quite messed up when you consider you're using the life of a fish to help you catch more fish. You'll also find daily fishing quests where you can unlock more recipes too.
</p>
<p>
Currently Bethesda is targeting a June release for those that don't play on the PTS, so you don't exactly have to wait that long if you want some bugs ironed out first.
