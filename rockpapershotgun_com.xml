            <p>From developers Cannibal Interactive, the creators of Purgatory Dungeoneer, springs forth a new labyrinth game. This one is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/labyrinth-of-wild-abyss-layeredux">Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux</a> and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don't just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who'll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander. Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, "I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant". But hey, it might be for you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>LayeRedux is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, then. A horror game that's less focused on jump scares and more on the feeling of being lost and not knowing what's around the next corner. There are <em>lots</em> of corners, spread across 50 handcrafted labyrinths with multiple floors, all kitted out with a single monster that'll kill you instantly if they touch you. Think you've lost them? Nah, sorry, you've probably passed an eye on the wall that would've alerted them to your precise location. You can't outsmart them. You can't have a nice chat with them. "There is no hope but to run", says the Steam page.</p>
<p>Moments of respite can be found at toilets, which also act as save points. It's here where the monsters can't get you. Although, these toilets can't be found on every floor of a labyrinth, so you best be careful.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux", a horror game about paranoia and persistence predation, is now out on Steam for $2.99! Enjoy vast hand-crafted labyrinths and the despair of escape! There is no reasoning with Monsters. There is no hope but to run.<a href="https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg">https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg</a> <a href="https://t.co/hml3yeO11h">pic.twitter.com/hml3yeO11h</a></p>— Damien Crawford (@TheWorstRPGDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWorstRPGDev/status/1851882608730460642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>I've not seen the film It Follows, but I've heard that it has a similar schtick? From what I gather, something in a human guise will follow you to the ends of the earth at a normal walking pace. So you could be at a train station looking up at the notice boards, when all of a sudden you notice a person staring directly at you and gently shoving others aside without breaking eye contact. That'll be the monster. And if they catch up with you: you die. I think that's a far from ideal situation and LayeRedux only goes and puts you directly in the monster's lair. No thanks.</p>
<p>But if you're like, "Yes thanks", then you can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3285660/Labyrinth_of_Wild_Abyss_LayeRedux/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-4-release-date-trailer-details-theories-and-predictions">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, <a href="https://x.com/ChachiBobinks/status/1851307428656161158">specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’</a>. Here’s a clip:</p>

<p>Violet McVinnie, currently of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> studio Long Way Home and previously a cinematographer at Bioware on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, has chimed in to speak about the animation.</p>
<p>“Ex Bioware dev here,” <a href="https://x.com/VioletMcVinnie/status/1851558624461496555">wrote McVinnie</a>. “I'm responsible for some of the "Bioware Turns". This anim is part of a set called "Posebreakers" which are intended to move characters around the area if a scene is feeling too static. We'd combine them with the infamous "Exit Left/Right" between cuts.”</p><p>People in McVinnie’s replies are also curating a collection of their favourite Bioware-isms, including 'flick of the wrist accusatory point', 'walk away nonchalantly while looking back over the shoulder', ‘worried forehead rub’, and ‘aggressive headshake after drinking alcohol’ (“just from the mocap recording”, says McVinnie).</p>
<p>One player asked why “everyone in Mass Effect break(s) eye contact and look(s) off to the side when handing objects to people?”, to which McVinnie replied “if it’s the hand off anim I think it is, it was baked into the animation file before we started using it. Not sure of the origin. Many animations propagate through lots of Bioware franchises. ME3's Thane/Kai Leng fight cutscene has a lot of Jade Empire combat animations stitched together.” We do love to see a bit of canny asset reuse.</p>
<p>I done wrote Wot I Think about Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">here</a>. In short: It’s not much of an RPG, and its action wears thin sooner than I’d have liked, but it’s got such heart and enthusiasm it won me right over by the end. Oh, I just remembered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">comments are temporarily down</a>, too! Sera best companion. Dragon Age 2 wasn’t that great. Anyone moaning about Marvel dialogue in the new game, fair enough, but I must ask if you’ve somehow erased Alistair from your memory. Happy Veilguard day to those who celebrate, and happy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184110/Widget_Inc/">Widget Inc</a> day to those who don't.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey (2017)</a> studio Arkane Austin - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">alongside a handful of others</a> - back in May.</p>
<p>Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president">for PC Gamer</a> about Arkane’s closure, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The rules that they play, we might not understand them. It's a different thing. It's hard to know why they did what they did,” said Colantonio. "The only thing that I stand by is saying that the specific choice of killing Arkane Austin, that was not a good decision."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever. When you have that magic of Harvey [Smith] and Ricardo [Bare] etc that all come together, it's a specific moment in time and space that just worked out this way, that took forever to reach. Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid. But what do I know?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Arkane Lyon - the original 1999 French studio from which Arkane Austin spun off in 2006 - are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Marvel’s Blade</a> - the last we saw of it was some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkane-release-new-marvels-blade-concept-artworks-hinting-at-missions-combat-and-levels">concept art</a> last December. WolfEye’s next project is an “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">evolution of Prey and Dishonored”</a>, and it sounds great. We’re currently expecting a ‘limited private alpha test’ next year. In August, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio Tango - shuttered by Xbox at the same time as Arkane Austin - had been rescued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">in a manner of speaking</a>, by Plunkbatters Krafton.</p>
