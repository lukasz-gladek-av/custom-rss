Do you ever think to yourself, "gee, I wish that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">LA Noire</a> actually looked like a noir film and also everyone is a furry"? Then boy howdy do I have the game for you: The Shadow Syndicate. It just got announced yesterday at the Gamescom Latam showcase, and I should say it's not exactly like LA Noire in that you don't have to try and read the faces of motion capture actors overperforming their hearts out. What it does have is some detective work, gunplay, and even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payneish</a> bullet-time. How can you not be into that mixture?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game is set in an early 1930s Brooklyn, and you play as private detective Sam Marlowe. According to a press release, Sam's mentor has gone missing, and alongside that there's a weird secret group getting up to no good.

<p>
I would like to point out there is also essentially zero mention of the fact that everyone is an anthropomorphic animal anywhere in said press release, the only mention it gets is "evocative character designs", which they certainly are. I'm into it though, this is a hard-boildish Noir we're talking about, everyone being a dog or a chicken is just the way of the world, don't think about it too hard.
</p>
<p>
There's two parts to the gameplay, one being the aforementioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gunplay, which does seem to borrow from Max Payne's iconic mechanic. The other is talking to citizens to collect clues, as well as interacting with the city at large, all of which gets jotted down in Sam's journal to help open up new dialogue options and story paths.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, The Shadow Syndicate doesn't have an exact release date just yet. It's due out some time in 2026 at the very least, and in the meantime, you can always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a "brand new Honkai game", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Kiana isn't from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Star Rail</a>, she's from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-impact">Impact 3rd</a>, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="547"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1kdsy74/new_honkai_game_announced/">New Honkai Game announced</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable-Feedback11/">u/Vegetable-Feedback11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/">HonkaiStarRail</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow.
</p>
<p>
There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account <a href="https://x.com/StarRailVerse1/status/1915725508639179139">Star Rail Universe</a> found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hoyoverse-stardew-valley-style-game-astaweave-haven-wechat-account-potential-announcement-soon">game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley</a>. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.

            <p>
Well, this is all a bit awkward. Yesterday, you might have seen claims that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> writer Yuji Horii accidentally confirmed that a remake of the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> is in the works. It all read a bit suspicious right off the bat, because it initially just came from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?sort=new">Reddit post</a> from someone who attended a panel Horii was speaking at during Napoli Comicon without any video evidence. Then some other posts started cropping up, alongside commenters saying they were also there and that this was true. Except, it isn't true, because it was all a translation miscommunication.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Later on in the day, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448211166?t=18941s">Twitch VOD</a> was shared of the event, where <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lo7v4b6jdc23">Gematsu</a> was able to confirm that Horii didn't actually mention anything about a remake of Chrono Trigger at all. It seems that somehow the interpreter interpreted something Horii said as confirmation of a remake. I can't tell you how that happened though, as I neither speak Japanese nor Italian. Go figure!
</p>
<p>
It's not exactly a surprise that such a story got people so excited so quickly. After all, on the game's 30th anniversary back in March, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> noted that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">plan to share word of various projects</a> that "go beyond the world of the game" later this year. I can't exactly blame someone for thinking that that's code for "a remake is coming", and for all I know one still is happening. It just hasn't been accidentally revealed by one of its lead writers, that's all.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don't even think it needs a remake. I'd imagine it would be an HD-2D one in the style of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> 3 and Live A Live, which while pretty, just feels pretty unnecessary. Of course, none of you can hold this against me if one does get announced and I think it looks cool, actually, ok? Cheers.

We're not too far off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> now, with the spinoff game due out right at the end of the month. Some of you might have even played some of it already, unlike James, who struggled to play any of it at all when the test was held <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ten-pc-games-i-could-have-played-in-full-during-the-time-i-spent-failing-to-connect-to-elden-ring-nightreign-on-ps5">back in February</a>. Considering how few of us have actually spent any time on it overall though, quite conveniently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> shared a little overview trailer yesterday that dove into what you'll be doing in the Fortniteish Souls game.
</p>
<p>
When you first drop into Limveld, you'll be doing so pretty weak as a level one character. From there, you can fight just regular old enemies, loot some treasure chests, the typical kind of thing you'd do in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. One thing that differs is that you can also sneak into different bases to try to get some info from some maps about the land. And, of course, there's also some big blighters that'll knock you down pretty easily if you're not careful you can try to take a whack at if you're feeling brave enough for some bigger rewards.
</p>

<p>
Another big difference is random events that can take place. As you might already know, from session to session the maps change shape, sometimes much more dramatically than others. Sometimes there'll be a volcanic area that erupts, or you'll have to trek through some woods full of rot. That guy that calls you a foul tarnished might rock up too! There honestly looks to be quite a lot of variation.
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite constantly dwindling circle storm aspect of the game isn't just a case of it slowly killing you while you're outside it. By the time nightfall comes, you'll be forced into a very tiny circle, having to fend off some much tougher enemies.
</p>
<p>
You'll also find that this game's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> looks a bit different. It's here where you'll equip relics that have different effects. Just your usual stat buffs and improved skills kind of things from the looks of it, but it wasn't a particularly comprehensive look. 
</p>
<p>
There's an in-game currency called murk that lets you buy different outfits for the preset characters, so there'll be some amount of customisation at the very least. And yes, there is a Solaire of Astora costume, amongst references to other characters too. My favourite's the hunter outfit from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, which won't be a surprise to anyone that knows me.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, despite not being able to make your own character, you can find something called fragments which unlock bits of the respective Nightfarers' backstory. And, of course, there's proper boss fights if you make it to the third day in a session. Wouldn't be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> without boss fights!
</p>
<p>
I'm still not entirely convinced by Nightreign as a concept, it's a smart way to reuse assets that's for sure. I just prefer my FromSoft games to be a little bit more handcrafted. Still, I'll keep my mouth shut until May 30th, when the game launches.

It seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is doing quite alright for itself, 'ey? The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">J'RPG</a> was awarded Rock Paper Shotgun's coveted Bestest Bests badge by our own Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">review</a>, and by all accounts it's been received well by most everyone else too. Not that sales matter much in terms of a game's quality, but the fact that it's done well there as well at minimum means the lights are staying on at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sandfall-interactive">Sandfall Interactive</a>. In fact it seems things are going better than just keeping the lights on, as it sounds like the developer is considering more of it, whatever that might be.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Earlier this week, screenshots of a conversation with the game's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen on Instagram were shared on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good.1683512/">NeoGAF</a>, where she was asked if there's plans for any Clair Obscur DLC (cheers, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dlc-has-a-good-chance-of-happening-according-to-games-lead-writer/">Vice</a>). Unsurprisingly, Svedberg-Yen said that as of now, there's "nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!"
</p>
<p>
The interesting bit followed that though, as Svedberg-Yen continued, "we've always said if there is a strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good." Now, that's obviously not a confirmation of any kind. It's not even the writer saying that there'll be DLC necessarily, just that there's hopes to do more, so it's still probably best to temper your expectations.
</p>
<p>
Still, it's nice to see an underdog do so well, especially in such a busy week for RPGs. Personally I'd love to see some DLC where they pop across the border to Germany, if only to have someone put a JRPG there.
