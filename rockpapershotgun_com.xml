I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. So I can only imagine how absolutely, overwhelmingly irritating it could be on a planet like Arrakis, where a sandstorm could quite easily kill you. Or, I suppose I don't have to imagine, as that's something you can actually experience in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. This is a video we're talking about here though, meaning there are fixes for problems like these. Namely, base building, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> showed off in a new video of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game yesterday.

When you start out, your base probably won't be all that fancy or useful. If you've got nowhere to store your bike, it'll likely be wrecked by the time the storm's died down. Over time you can build up bigger and stronger bases, which you can do so either by yourself or with friends (or enemies, if you swing that way). You can then align yourself with one of the two main houses, Atreides or Harkonnen, allowing you to build unique structures depending on who you picked.

On top of that, you can build and craft your own vehicles. I generally loathe when games let me do this as they can often be a bit too complicated, but judging from the trailer it almost looks like putting bits of Lego together, so I'm down to clown. If you've built your base up enough, you can put up shields so it doesn't get damaged, but you'll literally be taxed for this. At least you'll have a garage to store your cool car.
</p>
<p>
Any of your creations and bases can be turned into blueprints that you can share with or even sell to other players. Once they have the blueprint, they can just make the thing instantly. I'm assuming you'll still need some resources to do this, but it looks cool! Kind of reminds me of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Autobuild feature, albeit a bit more social.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, if you looked at your calendar today and thought "gee whizz, May's the month I get to play Dune: Awakening", think again, as last month the game caught a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">three week delay</a>. That means you'll be complaining about all that sand on June 10th. At least it'll be better sand than it would have been in May!

A frustrating thing I frequently find myself thinking about games is that they very rarely try to be more than what they are, at least when it comes to AAA ones (or any kind of game that has enough money for a full blown ad campaign). They're just so often… games. No interest or desire to expand the medium. Luckily, there are people doing the work to rethink what games are, and today we now have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, a "semi-autobiographical", almost documentary-like game about playing football in Ecuador in 2001.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game follows an eight year old Julián Cordero, one of the lead developers on the game, as he kicks about a football throughout Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Now, I'll be honest, I care about football about as far as I can throw one (it's not very far). That doesn't matter very much to me though because, from the looks of it, Despelote shows a connection to the beautiful game that anyone could get invested in.
</p>
<p>
Kicking around the football is all physics based too, it looks so satisfying just punting it off into the distance. The look of the game is impressive too. It has this filter to it that makes everything look like it's a photo that's been put through one of those free filters that comes with some camera app. I don't mean this derogatorily in any way, there's such a strong sense of texture to it that somehow makes it feel real and surreal at the same time. Exactly my kind of vibe.
</p>
<p>
All of the photos and audio in the game were apparently recorded on location, which is probably why Despelote looks to have such a strong look to it. This is what I'm talking about with expanding the medium. Autobiographical games aren't all too common, it joins works like Cibele and That Dragon Cancer in a very small niche, but I hope that more people consider doing the same.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote on Steam now</a>, and there's even a 10% launch discount until May 15th.
