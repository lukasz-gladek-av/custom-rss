            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-gladius-relics-war">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics Of War</a> developers Proxy Studios have just released Zephon, a new 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game set in a manky, post-apocalyptic world. It's got hexagonal maps, flesh trees, gangly Evangelion-grade giants, "otherworldly hymns of decay", nuclear bombs, and a player-led "blend of magic and cyberpunk" that extends from the city architecture to the research component. All of which is my cup of giblets. Here's the launch trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>OK, as and when I play, I'm probably going to turn off that unit dialogue. Why does everybody sound so chipper about being forced to trade blows with tentacle beasts? But the putrid scenery is inviting, and I like the sound of a "combat-focused" 4X with battles taking place on the same map as exploration and construction. I also like the premise of, essentially, deciding what particular flavour of sci-fantasy you want your civ to become. Will you field a robot army dolled up with alien gadgets, channel dark forces from beyond the veil, or some combination of the two? Here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humanity emerges, hesitantly, into ruination. Almost nothing is left of the world as we knew it--settlements, forests, seas, mountains--all have been blasted into unfamiliarity. Horribly mutated animals hunt in packs through deformed woodland. Decrepit military robots stumble unknowingly through the ruins, sensors and logic centres blown. Alien soldiers, once impossibly powerful, cower in the wrecks of their ships, praying to heedless gods for rescue.</p>
<p>Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some numbers. Over 50 unique units in battle! Over 150 technologies! Six kinds of climate to worry about as you paint the map! 11 tiered resources to account for when running your economy! OK, that's enough numbers. Don't fret, there are more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/">the Steam page</a>.</p><p>The aforesaid Gladius came out in 2018, at the height of the pre-Edwin period. It appears to have been well-received. How terribly embarrassing, then, for my vaunted predecessors at Rock Paper Shotgun, who never managed to review it. Fraser (RPS in peace) did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-gladius-relics-of-war-killed-off-all-the-diplomats">write about the absence of diplomatic options</a>. Zephon appears to be cut from the same cloth, even if it's comparatively deficient in Tyranids.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> developers Digital Extremes have announced a new round of early access for their 2025-bound fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a>, which I saw a bit of last year and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-full-reveal-shows-a-slow-and-pensive-fantasy-rpg-built-on-the-bones-of-warframe">think is pretty promising</a>. They're now adding 2000 players to a Preludes build of the game every week, with each invite email including an additional four invite codes, so you can get your friends involved.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you're new to Soulframe, it's a stately swords-and-sorcery affair with a hazy golden open world and procedural dungeons. It has the same visual opulence as Warframe, with richly woven costumes and an interface of painted scrolls and sigils, and the same appetite for screwy jargon-tastic lore writing. But it plays things quieter. Everything looks old and dusty and the pacing of exploration and encounters seems closer to From Software's work - you'll weigh up every blow. Last year, director Steve Sinclair summarised it as follows: "Where Warframe is fast and frenetic, Soulframe is going to be slow and pensive."</p>
<p>A bit of plot: you're a downfallen amnesiac soldier who must form pacts with the spirits of their ancestors. These pacts are the game's loadouts, encompassing character stats and sets of abilities. You also get access to the Nightfold, an extra-dimensional progression hub akin to Bloodborne's Hunter's Dream. You can expand the Nightfold's crafting and customisation facilities by asking your ancestors to move in.</p>
<p>Soulframe is another free-to-play offering from Digital Extremes, and the big worry as ever is how much the monetisation will sabotage the experience. That aside, I'm looking forward to it. Some smaller flourishes: when you die, you reincarnate as a bird at the last respawn site and have the option of flying back to resurrect your body. When you move between dimensions, your character falls backward through a portal with arms outspread, as though tumbling into bed at the end of a long day.</p><p>You can sign up for Preludes access <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">here</a>. If you don't manage to scrape an invite, Digital Extremes have also lifted restrictions on streams and videos of the Preludes area, so by all means fire up the Youtubes and have a gander. I'm sure somebody's published a 10 hour Let's Play already.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
