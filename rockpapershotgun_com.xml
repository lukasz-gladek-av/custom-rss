            <p>Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has launched into early access, and the developers have one of those old-timey roadmaps explaining how it will change before the 1.0 release, give or take a few teasing redactions. This being a game about miniaturised children fighting insects, of course, the road in question may be only a few metres long. A garden pathmap, perhaps? Let's have a look, then. </p><!--more-->
<p>Coming in a fall 2025 update, we can expect a building grid and quality of life improvements, a hotpouch for buggies, and a new boss called AXL, thought to be a spider. With AXL will come a new boss arena, crafting recipes, armor, weapons and furniture.</p>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 update in winter 2025 will introduce Steam Deck verification and cross-play features using a Microsoft account, plus support for rival handheld the ROG Ally. There is also talk of a new park area, a scanning tool called PEEP.R 2.0, a special damage type called Sour 2.0, and a new base-levelling stat, Cosiness. There will be new tier three equipment and omni-tool unlocks, together with a new mushroom set for base-building. Wash that down with a bucket of bugs: new species such as crickets and earwigs, and unspecified variations of existing creepy-crawlies.</p>
<p>The third big Grounded 2 update lands in summer 2026, and is all about swimming and ziplines. Also smoothies that grant status effects, watery bases, watery equipment (and some tier 4 gear and omni-tool unlocks), and some watery critters. There's an unnamed new park area on the way that is also likely to be aquatic in nature. Though I think it would be very funny if it turns out to be a large expanse of gravel.</p>
<p>After summer 2026, we enter the mist of Future Plans. These include more park areas, mutations, buggy customisation and progression, creatures, bosses, building options, and, well, just a whole lot of survival game junk, basically.</p>
<p>So far, the game seems to be doing well, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/">amply exceeding the original's launch player count</a> on Steam. We don't have a write-up for the moment, mostly because our team headcount is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">in the process of being miniaturised</a>, but freelance scribe Matt Reynolds has some guides to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-grub-locations">Grounded 2 grub locations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-thistle-needles-where-to-find">where to find thistle needles</a>, among other challenges.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The game of chicken between publishers and players over whether $80/£70 is an acceptable price for the shiniest of video games continues. EA have announced that, as regards their forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, they don't think it is, but that may change, because they are never going to say no to more money. </p><!--more-->
<p>Some brief background: executives at various companies have been bandying around the idea of a general price hike for a while. The broad justification often given is that standard price points for blockbuster shootybangers such as Battlefield have not risen in proportion to development costs, and that games theoretically offer many more hours of funtimes than, say, those stupid no-good films, with their shocking absence of levelling systems and sidequests.</p>
<p>Capcom's president Harushiro Tsujimoto, for example, recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-president-game-prices-too-low-resident-evil-4-1850874279">opined</a> that "raising unit prices is a healthy option for business". Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer">has suggested that</a> videogame prices are "very, very low" for what they give you. Michael Douse, publishing director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">reckons</a> "almost all games should cost more at a base level". He thinks next year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> could breach the current, widely embraced $70/£60 ceiling for the standard boxed edition of a premium game.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have beaten Rockstar to it. They've been selling first-party Switch 2 games for $80, and appear to be <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">getting away with it</a>, though a lot of game sales at launch form part of hardware bundles. As ever, it's worth noting that Nintendo enjoy a stature among game publishers equivalent to the High Elves in Tolkien. That's to say, they've been around forever and do not have to live by the same crude laws as the mortal races. </p>
<p>The same isn't true of Microsoft, who recently tried to raise the price of Obsidian's corpo satire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> to $80. Mass internet screeching resulted, and Microsoft decided <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">they were going to sell The Outer Worlds 2 for $70 after all</a>, spoofishly framing this on social media as the intervention of a government regulator. At what point in capitalism's co-option of criticism of capitalism do skulls start to actually implode, I wonder.</p>
<p>Now, here comes TD Cowen analyst Douglas Lippl Creutz with a question for EA chief executive officer Andrew Wilson during the publisher's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805853-electronic-arts-inc-ea-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">latest quarterly earnings report</a>. He would like to know whether EA are considering selling Battlefield 6 and other major games for $80, in the wake of Microsoft and Nintendo's movements.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson responded, continuing that "we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>Here are some simple, non-exhaustive objections to the "games should cost more" reasoning above: some game development budgets are exorbitant because the projects are badly managed, and there is a difference between a game making enough money and a game making enough money for its investors. Publishers often have frankly insane expectations. There was no mention in the quarterly earnings call of a recent report that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want Battlefield 6 to attract 100 million players</a>, a feat no other Battlefield game has come close to achieving.</p>
<p>The game's first single player trailer surfaced last week, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">a terrible show of helicopter abuse</a>. Look out for a full reveal of the multiplayer tomorrow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-wont-cost-80-but-ea-arent-ruling-out-future-price-hikes-to-capture-the-full-spectrum-of-pricing]]></content:encoded>
