You know, I'm going to be very real with you right now: I thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-rumble">Sonic Rumble</a> was already out. It feels like I've been hearing about this thing for an eon now, probably because it was leaked a good while before Sega even officially revealed it. And yet here we are, with an announcement from the house of hog (sorry) saying that in actual fact, it's not out until May 8th, exactly a month from now! Perhaps this is a sign that I'm losing track of time, perhaps this is a game that Sega has been cooking in the kitchen for a bit too long. Who's to say!

This one's obviously a lot more geared towards kids that say to their parents "can you put Sonic on your phone" given that it'll be available on iOS and Android, but even though it does appear to be skipping out on a console release, it is coming to PC via Steam.

The skins-inclined amongst you - I appreciate this is the worst possible way to put this - might be interested to know that <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3Ddb045d06-e0f8-4d7d-8de3-69c167c330d2">the more wishlists there are</a>, the more goodies you get when the game arrives, like a movie Sonic skin, who honestly looks a bit terrifying.

I'm not easily won over by free-to-play games all that much, though I do think the kind of toy vibe Sonic Rumble has is cute. It looks like it's being quite smart about how it folds in that general Sonic feel to its more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque levels too. Seriously though, I like movie Sonic's design, but there's something not right about the Sonic Rumble skinâ€¦
