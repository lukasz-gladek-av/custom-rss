You'd think that with Summer Game Fest technically being all wrapped up by now we'd all be done with showcases, and yet here <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> are with a Spotlight of their own. One little game that got a look-in was, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. Specifically, the second title update was shown off, which as always is adding a whole bunch of things in, so let's jump in.

<p>
There's two big monsters joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game with this update, which arrives next Monday, June 30th. First up is Lagiacrus, a big, blue, electricity crocodile/ dragon lookin' fella, who was also the flagship monster from Monster Hunter 3. Sure to be a hit, I imagine. There's also Seregios from Monster Hunter 4, a quick-moving, partially flying monster that honestly kind of just looks like a Chocobo.

July 23rd will see the arrival of the Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a limited time event where the main hub will be decorated all fancy, and you'll be able to get equipment, gestures, and the like.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a Monster Hunter themed Fender guitar was released to celebrate the series' anniversary, and now in an event that's taking place from August 27th to September 24th, you'll be able to get a gesture that lets you shred some sick licks on an in-game version of the same guitar. Video games!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a bunch more outfits that you'll be able to pick up, free DLC like dance gestures, paid DLC like a new cosmetic pack, layered weapons are being added in, you'll be able to swap your handles so you can travel with Erik instead of Alma, and Mina, a sword and shield support hunter, is being added into the game. Oh, and you'll be able to choose which support hunters you bring with you on missions too. Title update 3 should be coming late September, but no exact release date on that one just yet.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is discounted right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a> thanks to its summer sale. The action game is 20% off, making it £48 down from £60, which still isn't cheap, but hey, take what you can get, especially with a game that only came out this year. Just keep in mind that it seems like your mileage when it comes to performance might vary.
