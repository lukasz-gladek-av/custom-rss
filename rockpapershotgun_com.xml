As someone who's never played a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> game, seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year confused me simply because I didn't know it was a prequel. I generally prefer to play things in release order, but I understand why Square Enix did it that way around, and why they subsequently announced a double remake of the first two games. The third one launched just last November, leaving 1 and 2 with a vague 2025 release window. Well, until today, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared that the pair of remakes will be launching October 30th.

While the first couple of Dragon Quests are technically available on modern platforms like the Nintendo Switch and mobile, you can't actually get them on PC. That means when the remakes launch it'll be the first time any of us in computer land can play them (officially speaking, of course). As mentioned I've not played any of them, just a series I've not gotten to yet, but neither of them are meant to be very long (hence the packaging of them together), so this doesn't seem like the worst way to tackle them.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I know this shouldn't be treated as the definitive way to play them, I just also don't always get along with the rough edges of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. These'll likely have sanded off said edges, and that's just fine with me, I'll leave all that stat min-maxing to all you sickos out there.
</p>
<p>
There's also a version of the game coming aptly titled the Erdrick Trilogy which combines all three remakes together, if you've not picked the third one up yet. And if you own the full trilogy, you'll get a, uh, dog suit to wear in Dragon Quest 1, and a cat suit to wear in Dragon Quest 2. Sure!
