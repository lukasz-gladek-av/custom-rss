            <p>
I'm a bit tantalised by FPS Quest, but I do worry that it has already defanged its most interesting ideas. Developed by Farlight Games Industry, it's a dungeon crawler in which your frame-rate "is your health", with mistakes and damage causing slowness and stuttering. 
</p>
<p>
To regain health/frame-rate, you must do what you do when running any game on a potato PC - fiddle with the settings like you're bargaining with an especially recalcitrant devil. This extends from lowering the quality of wall textures and characters, to plucking out whole pieces of environment. The more you do this, of course, the stranger the world becomes and the harder it is to navigate. The killer line from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3989240/FPS_Quest/">the Steam page</a>: "optimizing is risky". You'll also have to keep a lid on a simulation of your PC's temperature, and there are faux-prototype off-map areas to explore via noclip-style abilities.

<p>
It's a metafictional melange in the spirit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>. The developers have woven a story around the 'give me performance or give me death' gimmick that engages some familiar philosophical disputation about authorial intention and reception. 
</p><p>
You are a random player who has installed a weird mod. The mod's developers are one of the factions - they're keen to monetise their creation. They're opposed by OutofBounds, "enemies of monetization and difficulty, guiding you with shortcuts and secrets". Both groups are at odds with the Custodians, "defenders of the original developer's vision, opponents of glitches and cheats". And then there are a couple of in-game AI personalities, the Null Process, "a broken AI that only wants you to stop progressing so it can rest", and the Dungeon Lord, "an overenthusiastic, paternalistic, and clumsily offensive AI who tries to 'help' by removing obstacles". 
</p>
<p>
You'll connect with these nebulous third parties mostly or exclusively through how you play, rather than by way of dialogue or text. There are unlockable "scripts" that seemingly affect your standing with the factions. One of these is a "dynamic bullet time" feature whereby you speed and slow the game using your mousewheel.
</p>
<p>
There is scope for more chinstroking beyond the intrigues detailed on that Steam page. If you literally make a bug a feature, is it still a bug? What counts as a 'real' glitch or technical error in a game that is 'designed to be broken'? What counts as genuinely unfinished in a game that models the unfinished? We end up in this bizarre position of tethering authenticity to the absence of intention. Now, imagine if DICE suddenly applied all these brainy convolutions to the writing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Again, though, I'm not sure FPS Quest has full confidence in its own concept. The narrative metaphor may prove to be set dressing for a regular fantasy action experience with progression elements, and a novel way of presenting secret areas. The developers already seem disinclined to push it too far, or take it too seriously. Death takes the form of an MS-DOS bluescreen with the text "the game will now close to prevent further humiliation" - more Borderlands than Barthes, for my onions.
</p><p>
The devs also qualify that they're only simulating FPS drops within the simulation, not actually altering your PC frame rate, because "playing at low real FPS is uncomfortable and nauseating. That's why the game simulates a low-FPS world and turns it into gameplay: a fun challenge, just like other games turn unfun or boring real-life tasks into playable mechanics." I understand the caution here, but... I do often like it when games make me feel uncomfortable, and now I know in advance that FPS Quest won't challenge me too much. Anyway, this is out: at some point. Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fps-quest/trailer">PCGN</a> for passing it on.

            <p>While it hasn't taken as commanding a stranglehold over the world's collective consciousness as its debut series did, the second helping of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> is succeeding in helping drive a number of extra Steam players back to the wasteland. That said, a number of said wastelands being heavily discounted as part of the platform's recently concluded winter sale likely hasn't hindered those efforts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">Psycho Consuming Gamer</a>, SteamDB's charts since the episodes of the show started to drop on December 16th feature lines going up. Getting into <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/#3y">specifics</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s gone from oscillating around the 20,000 players mark to hitting a peak of 44,000 players on January 4th, following a gradual rise over the festive period. So, that number's effectively doubled, though it's comfortably dwarfed by the mammoth 187,000 peak the game hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">thanks to the show's first series</a> back in April 2024.</p>
<p>Beavis and Butthead pairing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> have also seen bumps in the same timespan. The former's naturally prospered more, rising from the region of 8,000 to a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22380/charts/#3y">just over 19,000</a> the same day Fallout 4 had its biggest recent spike. Fallout 3's gone from averaging around 100 players to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22300/charts/#3y">just under 200</a> at its version of this peak.</p>
<p>Then, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, the game Bethesda clearly pushed to be the intended main beneficiary of any second series player bump, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-tour-of-fallout-76s-burning-springs-with-our-recently-defrosted-ohioan-historian">Goggins ghoul-toting Burning Springs expansion</a> dropping just before the show. The multiplayerpocalyspse's numbers jumped from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/charts/#3y">around 10,000 to around 20,000</a> with Burning Springs' release in early December, and have since peaked at just under 30,000. For context, it hit a peak of 73,000 players with the show's first season. These latest New Vegas and Fallout 3 numbers are similarly dwarfed by their season one marks.</p><p>That's not too suprising. The first series of the Fallout show had that debut novelty to it and dropped at a time of year when everyone wasn't busy with the holidays and new year celebrations. That also usually means plenty of free time, something Amazon are almost certainly banking on in terms of watch numbers.</p>
<p>What's not clear is the extent to which the games being discounted in Steam's wallet-zapping winter sale helped, but for context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> Special Edition's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/#1y">player count</a> has remained relatively close to the marks in the region of 30,000 to 40,000 players it was hitting prior to December 16th - its highest mark over the festive period was just over 46,000 players.</p>
<p>With the fourth episode of Fallout season two set to drop today, January 7th, we'll have to see if the lines continue to go up as things build up to the series finale in early February.</p>
