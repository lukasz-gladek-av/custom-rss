            <p>You might remember Where Winds Meet as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-open-world-games">open world</a> Wuxia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that mixes scenes of exquisite calligraphy with scenes of hooligan sword masters subjecting blameless bears to sonic bombardment, paralysing whole gangs of chimney sweeps with chained Blink attacks, and getting chased by angry geese.</p>
<p>If you don't, you can watch the below trailer or read Ed Thorn's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wildly-ambitious-rpg-that-lets-you-yeet-bears">preview from 2023</a>, in which he commented "I'm both excited to see more and a tad worried it could end up being a disjointed, overstretched mash". Then you can consider signing up to the game's next playtest, which runs from July 25th to July 30th.</p><!--more-->

<p>The playtest introduces the city of Kaifeng, "with over one million square meters to discover", plus "10,000 NPCs" to befriend, pickpocket, punch (perhaps because they've witnessed you pickpocketing) and bother for quests. I'm not clear on whether this means 10,000 individually modelled NPCs, or 10,000 NPCs on screen, or just 10,000 NPCs in total. The figure seems meaningless without context. I should probably delete that line. Ah, but then I'd have to rewrite all this. Argh, let's keep going. </p>
<p>Expect "sharp contrasts - from the luxury of Fanlou Golden Street to struggling slums, from grand palaces to the mysterious ghost market". Also, "a range of classic Chinese activities", including bathhouse visits and traditional opera. The city will change in response to your actions: "abandoned wheat fields may flourish again, and rundown streets can become lively neighborhoods". Sounds like a lot of Video Game, but I'm mostly here to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p7Esu6l_9M">mess people up with a brolly</a>. </p>
<p>The developers are Everstone Studio, and the publishers are NetEase, who've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-publishers-reveal-blood-message-a-naughty-dog-style-singleplayer-action-game-set-in-tang-era-china">making waves recently with their bigger-budget productions</a> and also, with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">rumoured layoff plans</a>. Fancy that playtest? It'll run on Steam, but you need to  <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">sign up via this page</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-world-wuxia-rpg-where-winds-meet-is-having-a-city-sized-playtest-this-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I'm writing up Astro Prospector for a couple of reasons: firstly, it reminds me of two childhood favourites, Atari's Asteroids and the less-known Crystal Quest for the Macintosh. And secondly, there's something appealingly perverse about a <em>bullet hell</em> of all gametypes that is always simulating the player nodding off at the keyboard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's an "incremental" single-screen shmup and office burnout spoof in which you control a spaceship with the mouse, auto-mining asteroids for giant coffee beans, while avoiding or destroying the forces of the villainous SpaceCorp.</p>
<p>The length of each round depends on your pilot's starting caffeine intake: after a few seconds, their eyelids will droop shut and obscure the view. But you can grind your beans between missions to unlock buffs that empower your ship and prolong your wakefulness. One of the unlocks lets you fly through hoops that generate Flow, the productivity guru's favourite tipple.
</p>
<p>
The first SpaceCorp enemies consist of lethargic fidget-spinners - easily flummoxed by orbiting slowly around them. Later enemies deliver the expected screenfuls of projectiles, obliging you to follow very particular paths across the screen while continuing to excavate the swirling spacerocks.</p>
<p>As frenetic as the battles get, though, it seems you'll always have to worry about your pilot falling asleep. To sleep: perchance to dream of upgrade screens. And then, back to the gauzy brown starfields for a top-up. Such madness. So sadness. Nice pixel HUD and ship designs, though. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Find the demo on Steam</a>.

            <p>Gun.</p>
<p>There are a lot of them in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, it being a shooter and all. HD2 players aren't happy for it to end there though.</p>
<p>They've been asked for their input in renaming the single city on Super Earth they've so far succeeded in rebuilding since all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Illuminate invasion business</a>, and they're voting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">Gun</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let's face it, given the precedents set by the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36064659">Boaty McBoatface</a> and its lesser known NASCAR twin the <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/05/01/why-kansas-nascar-cup-called-buschy-mcbusch-race-400/4897438001/">2021 Buschy McBusch Race 400</a> (yes, that was a name given to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Buschy_McBusch_Race_400">actual professional motor race</a>), this isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Having managed to rebuild the city of Remembrance through their recent Galactic War efforts, players are currently voting in an <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1391934973841375273">Arrowhead-run Discord poll</a> dedicated to deciding on a new name for it. A new name by which to remember Remembrance. Yep, the whole thing's the usual kind of Helldiversy meta-joke that's still managed to make me crack a grin.</p> <div>

<p>Cue the equally jokey response thus far. 35k and counting votes, that's over 70% of the total share, to rename the city 'Gun'. Well ahead of the second place runner 'Everlasting Memory', which currently boasts just over 9k votes, and third place 'New Remembrance' at 3k. Now, the option that's currently last, 'Peacebeacon's Bloodlight', I'd argue deserves to be there, but I think fourth place 'Winds of Change of Tides of War' warrants a bit more than just over 1k votes.</p>
<p>Sure, it's far too long, but you could abbreviate it to the snappy WoCoToW, which would only make you sound a bit like an alarmed space bird being attacked by a Terminid whenever you say it. Plus, long-winded and grandiose bollocks is the name of the game with HD2's Starship Troopers-ish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">satire of the fash</a>. Did everyone just forget naming their ships something like 'Ombudsman of Individual Merit'?</p>
<p>Anyway, they're clearly gonna name it 'Gun', which is still at least minor chuckleworthy and also feels very 2025. That is to say, I'm not too pistolff about it.</p>
