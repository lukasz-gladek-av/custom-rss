Almost two years after it was first revealed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> have released a first-look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot's gameplay. And you know what? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's looking really good! And it's out September 23rd! Much like the reveal trailer it's incredibly stylish, there's this clean, almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> like quality to its world, but we've had hints of that already. The big thing is the gameplay, which looks like more of that chunky, Bungie, first-person shooting goodness.

<p>
In terms of how matches work, you can form teams of up to three people as you head out to collect loot. Dying normally means losing any loot you've collected, but if you manage to get out successfully you can hang on to it for future runs. Matches can have up to 18 players, though it sounds like there won't necessarily be that many all the time, as you can even go solo if you like.

At launch there'll be six runners to choose from, but Marathon won't just be about the gameplay, as there'll be seasonal storytelling events too. Also, no idea why, but all of these details were delivered to us from Final Fantasy 16's own Ben Starr. Can't complain though, great voice!
</p>
<p>
The thing you'll probably most be interested in, though, is that the game is getting a closed alpha. This kicks off April 23rd and runs until May 4th, but there's a catch: it's for North America only. Perhaps a bit annoying for the rest of us, but I've never known gamers to be anything but a patient bunch. You'll have to join the game's official Discord to sign-up.
</p>
<p>
I'm really not much of a shooter person, they've never clicked with me honestly, but boy howdy does Marathon's sci-fi world look like it might change things for me. One concern I do have is that Bungie are obviously known for vaulting a large portion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s story - so much so it <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis">had to use fan made videos in a court case</a> to show off the game's story - that I can't help but wonder how they'll handle Marathon. I guess we'll find out in due time!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, you can watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlC31D_Rr-Y?si=GeF-7H49-3lRQSGk">highlight reel</a> of a bunch of YouTubers and Twitch streamers playing the game to get more of a feel of moment to moment gameplay. Just watch out for that Geoff Keighley jumpscare.

I won't lie, sometimes when I hear a string of words like "beautiful hand-drawn Metroidvania with challenging combat etc., etc.," my eyes do start to glaze over a bit. It can be a bit buzzwordy! But, gosh, that there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-eternal-life-of-goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> looks a bit stunning doesn't it? It was shown off last month during Nintendo's Not Switch 2 Direct, but earlier this week it received another trailer offering another look, and more importantly, who'll be composing it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There'll actually be a few people making music for the game, though the trailer is geared around Yasunori Nishiki, whose work you'll have most recently heard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth through a few arrangements. He's worked on a few other Square Enix games too, like helping out on Final Fantasy 7 Remake and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, and he's the lead composer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series. I've not played any of them but I have heard a few tracks from them and they all have quite lovely scores, so Nishiki seems like a pretty damn good get.
</p>

<a aria-label="The Eternal Life of Goldman - Yasunori Nishiki Announcement Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tPgDbhIxMg?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
He'll also be joined by the likes of Kevin Penkin (Florence, Star Wars: Visions), Mason Lieberman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a>), and Pete Lepley (Wargroove, Sky Rogue). The new trailer is quite cute, as it's framed as Nishiki not having started working on any music yet, with the other three composers giving him some friendly, perhaps contrasting advice.
</p>
<p>
The music that has been made so far is sounding good too. I'm really quite fond of how the game has an elderly protagonist too, despite being an action-focused game. Love it when a game knows anyone can be the hero!
</p>
<p>
Currently The Eternal Life of Goldman doesn't have a release date, but you could always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.
