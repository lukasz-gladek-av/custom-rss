            <p>"What morbid force is calling you deeper into the heart of the caves?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004390/The_Cave_Diver/">asks the Steam page for The Cave Diver</a>. It ain't calling me, developer Ovsko. I read the opening words of your description and immediately started running away from my laptop. I'm still running, in fact. This article is being breathlessly dictated to Oisin over the phone. I'm somewhere in the vicinity of Luton, now, and hope to make it all the way to Scotland by the weekend.</p>
<p>After that, there'll be the problem of securing naval travel as I continue my headlong flight. Then I'll have to worry about frostbite as I gallop past the North Pole and begin my long traversal of the Pacific. At some point I will reach New Zealand, which - according to this handy <a href="https://www.antipodesmap.com/">antipodal mapping site</a> - is approximately as far away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cave-diver">The Cave Diver</a> Steam page currently loaded on my laptop as I can get without venturing into outer space. I do not rule out venturing into outer space, which is notable for its complete and categorical deficit of caves.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you think I'm being hysterical. Friend, The Cave Diver is about perishing repeatedly in crawlspaces a few inches wide, deep below the surface. It's a game based on <a href="https://x.com/LostMemeArchive/status/1896898262399168898">that awful cutaway image</a> you've doubtless seen and flinched away from on social media. And also, beloved lunchbreak physics diversion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>. What kind of vile intellect turns QWOP into... <em>this</em>? I guess there's nothing for it but to roll the trailer.</p>

<p>The premise here is that you're trying to find a possibly-mythical subterranean flower that has the ability to cure your paraplegia. You move using your hands and arms and, where called for, the element of momentum. You can also scrawl signs on the rock to navigate by during your next attempt, in the quite likely event that you die. The threat of being crushed or trapped aside, the depths harbour some kind of ancient, ravenous evil. Going by the logo art, The Oesophagus Diver would have been an acceptable alternative title.</p>
<p>It's out later this year. With any luck, I'll have reached New Zealand by then and reinvented myself as a travelling hairdryer salesman who still dreams of being an astronaut. It wouldn't be the first time. If you have a grotesque fascination with caves - which to be honest, I sort of do, as long as I can stand up in them - you might also enjoy free 20-minute spookelunker <a href="https://sole-rift.itch.io/crawl">Crawl</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Despite the best efforts of all concerned, there are once again new PC games this week. See how they frolic among the days ahead, trampling all over our life commitments and need for tranquility like boisterous, fugitive oxen. Please equip yourself with a broom, weighted net and klaxon and help me herd them back into the pens, for proper disassembly. Here are a few I've rounded up already.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546740/Champions_Tactics_Reforged/">Champions Tactics Reforged</a> may yet prove a routine turn-based PvP battler, but it does have exceptionally handsome tabletop figurines. The kind of thing I wish I'd been able to paint back when I played Mordheim.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 20th May</h2>
<li>Here be some "Enhanced" editions of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427410/STALKER_Shadow_of_Chornobyl__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chornobyl</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427420/STALKER_Clear_Sky__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427430/STALKER_Call_of_Prypiat__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call Of Prypiat</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-siege-and-the-sandfox">The Siege and the Sandfox</a> is a sidescrolling stealth metroidvania affair with some moderately bewitching pixelart visuals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumping-jazz-cats">Jumping Jazz Cats</a> is a feline racing game, if such a thing can be credited.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/">Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer</a> is a private-eyeful of point-and-click, involving a serial killer and a biker detective.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 21st May</h2>
<li> Twoot twoot! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> is pulling up to the station with another confusing payload of tower defence and roguelite deck-building.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/">FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> is one for the Animal Crossers and Zeldarlings, a "slow life" RPG about doing up a neglected island and/or fighting monsters in the surrounding open world.</li>
<h2>Thursday 22nd May</h2>
<li>Break the traditional construction grid in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265070/City_Tales__Medieval_Era/">City Tales - Medieval Era</a>, out this day in early access.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is about barging through a 1950s toy-town in the style of a GTA game. I played about 40 minutes at an event last year and found it a bit shrugworthy, but the scenery is nice.</li>
<li>Sure, go on then - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown">a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tactics RPG</a> from Clickolding and I Am Your Beast outfit Strange Scaffold.</li>
<h2>Friday 23rd May</h2>
<li>Did you miss the original Onimusha 2? It's back with new controls and gossamer HD visuals in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a> is about using cards to build kingdoms, and hurling rocks at armies.</li>
<li>Let's make it two detective game reccs this week. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714620/Duck_Detective_The_Ghost_of_Glamping/">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> asks you to "throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice". Commendable!</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, James has been making forbidding noises about Computex 2025, the latest appalling rebirth of the Taipei, Taiwan-based tech show. Expect a few headlines with unpronounceable acronyms in them, and probably a lot of unreportable guff about genAI. Speaking of events: I'm attending Summer Games Fest for RPS in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying to clear out a few features before I'm deluged in fresh interview material.</p>
<p>Nic and Brendy are juggling various review commitments, like brilliant hell jesters on unicycles. Graham is forming terrible plans and chewing his way through another stack of freelance edits. Ollie continues his quest to write a complete instruction manual for all of existence, aka our guides section, and Jeremy is still blissfully on holiday. What are you up to this week? Playing anything fun?</p>
