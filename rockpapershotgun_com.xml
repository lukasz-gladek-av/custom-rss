            <p>Evacuate your Deep Desert tents, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s latest patch enacts a timer tweak aimed at eliminating cheeky PvP zone border camping. It's also added some extra rewards to the Landsraad and switched up how goodies are distributed to PvE players.</p>
<p>This patch comes as Funcom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">continue to respond</a> to player feedback about the endgame loop, having already moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">split the </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> between PvP and PvE in order to placate folks who aren't a fan of the latter. Griefing's also been a big topic of debate, with ornithopters proving just as deadly as those big worms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While Dune: Awaking <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">patch 1.1.15.0</a> isn't massive, it's delivered some changes that're well worth the attention of those who've been sinking as many hours into the game as there are grains of sand on Arrakis.</p>
<p>First of all, the good news. Those who've been craving Landsraad rewards that don't depend on you getting in uber-quick and being the first to complete a task after it goes live can breathe a sigh of relief. You'll now get a "personal contribution" reward from turning in kills or deliveries on completed tasks, with the winning faction and how many guild votes were awarded staying set in stone.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, the patch's other biggest talking point is that the delay timer you're hit with when leaving a PvP security zone has been "increased from five to 30 seconds to prevent border camping and allow PvP players to protect their area." Folks seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/">pretty split</a> at first glance as to whether this change'll be good or bad for would-be griefers, so we'll just have to see how it plays out in practice.</p>
<p>There are also a number of tweaks to crafting component, resource, and unique loot drops/spawns in the Deep Desert. "Tier 6 resources can now be collected across wider areas in the PvE part of the Deep Desert" is the headliner, and Funcom's added "an element of randomization to the respawn timer of unique loot containers" in the DD.</p>
<p>Rounding out the most noteworthy stuff to my eye, you can listen out for "a new audio alert" signaling PvP zone changes, and they claim they've fixed an exploit that somehow let you build vehicles with items from another player’s inventory.</p>
<p>Funcom have also "reduced the cases where the sandworm can push vehicles under terrain", which is good news for those keen to avoid a gitchy demise. Or maybe you liked having your Sandbike nudged into the terrifying void under the map. To each their own.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has made a statement about the dramatic reshuffle of management at the studio, saying that it "stings" to have the game and company taken away from him by publishing overlords Krafton. He also asserts that the game is "ready for early access", but that Krafton may disagree. It doesn't explicitly answer any of the outstanding questions about what actually happened at the studio to cause the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">axing of three senior leaders last week</a>. But it does provide some clues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For background, three chiefs at Unknown Worlds were "replaced" last week by the studio owners Krafton, who installed a new figure as CEO of the company. Co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, plus former CEO Ted Gill, were all summarily ousted from their positions. In their place Krafton shipped in Steve Papoutsis, a producer who has worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> series. </p>
<p>The exact reasons remain cloudy, but the language of Krafton's original press release suggested a disatisfaction with the pace at which Unknown Worlds was working. Following the power shuffle, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">also released a statement</a> that asked fans to be patient while Papoutsis found his feet on the project. It didn't clear much up.</p>

<p>Now, co-founder Charlie Cleveland has spoken about the events in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">a statement posted across social media</a>, saying that it hurts to find himself out of the studio. He writes at length about the studio's history, and significantly notes that Subnautica 2 is the second most-wishlisted game on Steam.</p>
<p>"So you can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock. We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>The assertion that the game is "ready for early access" raises an eyebrow, as it seems to contradict Krafton's version of events. In their statement, they said that the studio under Papoutsis would have to commit to "clearly defined metrics and targets" presumably hitting the demanded quality by set deadlines. "This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time," they said. They didn't mention any internal disagreement over whether the game was currently ready or not.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Altogether this suggests that the leadership of Unknown Worlds and their business daddies at Krafton were at loggerheads over the quality of the early access build, which was intended to release some time in 2025 with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">an early access life of 2-3 years</a> before hitting 1.0. Elsewhere in the statement, Cleveland talks about the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and says: "There's no way it would've been as successful if we had waited until v1.0 before releasing it to the public." </p>
<p>This may help explain why Papoutsis was parachuted in. For context, Unknown Worlds are known for transparent and steady-paced development through early access. Papoutsis' studio Striking Distance is known for releasing a shonky shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/callisto-protocol-director-takes-responsibility-for-crunching-staff">badly affected by intense crunch</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cleveland's statement does not go into the specifics of the falling out, beyond those assertions. So there are likely wrinkles to the drama we still don't know. His statement is mostly a nostalgic waltz through his career at the studio, which began as a group of modders. He does end with the line "this is not where the story ends", although doesn't specify if this means a new venture in video games, or something from his <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/">AI-assisted movie company</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the release schedule for Subnautica 2 itself seems to be under review. "An update to our schedule and more information, including the Early Access timeline, will be coming soon," said Unknown Worlds. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree]]></content:encoded>

        <p>AI is a "bs excuse" for recent layoffs, says Raphael Colantonio</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Seemingly in response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox</a>, Arkane founder and WolfEye president Raphael Colantonio has <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388">taken to socials</a> to ask why no-one is talking about "the elephant in the room", Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>Microsoft's subscription service is "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade," Colantonio wrote, "subsidised by MS's 'infinite money'. I don't think GP can co-exist with other models, they’ll either kill everyone else, or give up". Cheers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-the-wake-of-xbox-layoffs-founder-of-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-slams-game-pass-why-is-no-one-talking-about-the-elephant-in-the-room">IGN</a>.</p>

<p>Colantonio then brought up Xbox's public denial and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales">later admission</a> - in documents related to the Activision Blizzard merger - that Game Pass impacts direct game sales. He also suggested that Microsoft's stated goal of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/behind-microsofts-layoffs-a-new-attitude-shaped-by-ai/">cutting costs to invest heavily in AI</a> was a "bs excuse" for the layoffs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that Microsoft laid off around 2,500 workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">across</a> its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">gaming</a> division in 2024, with more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">across the company this year</a>, prior to the current round. It seems unlikely investments into AI have played no part in numbers like this. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">recent Wired report</a> (paywalled) implies significant correlation between studios adopting AI tools for specific disciplines before laying off workers that specialise in those areas, as was the case with ActiBlizz laying off artists after putting up Call Of Duty GenAI cosmetics for sale.</p>
<p>According to Colantonio's own math, however, the funds sunk into Game Pass are still significant. "When a deal is too good, there is a reason," he wrote. "They are still not profitable after 8 years, they are still in customer acquisition phase, hoping one day the subscription revenue will be &gt; to the investments ($100B in acquisitions+licensing+dev costs). Do the math, they have 35m subscribers, including the $1."</p>
<p>As IGN note, Xbox don't report on the financials of Game Pass in detail, though they have shared that "Xbox content and services grew 8% year-over-year, which was in part due to growth in Xbox Game Pass. PC Game Pass revenue increased 45% year-over-year".</p>
<p>"What *might* happen once MS has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up," Colantonio wrote. "Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsided by MS bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition".</p>
<p>This line of argument echoes <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/former-xbox-executive-nervous-about-industry-impact-of-game-pass-3231799">comments made by former Xbox exec Ed Fries</a> on a podcast in 2022. "Game Pass scares me because there’s a somewhat analogous thing called Spotify that was created for the music business,” Fries said. “So we have to be careful we don’t create the same system in the game business. These markets are more fragile than people realise.”</p>
<p>Josh Herrman of The Intelligencer <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/spotify-is-eating-the-entire-music-business.html">described Spotify's 2022 financials</a> as a "weird, loser-take-all outcome — which happens from time to time in tech, where dominant firms are allowed to bleed money for years in pursuit of long-term sector domination". The music streaming giant has been long-criticised for giving artists the raw end of the deal, leaving them to rely on touring and merch sales for an income.</p>
<p>Whether this translates directly to games is contested, however. Here's a<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187"> 2025 study for the International Journal of Research in Marketing</a> arguing that Game Pass and PS Plus have "limited impact on video game revenue (contrary to the cannibalizing effects observed in the music, movie and TV industry)."</p>
<p>"Only the gamers like it because the offer is too good to be true," said Colantonio, "but eventually even gamers will hate it when they realize the effects on the games.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-pass-will-either-kill-everyone-else-or-give-up-says-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-founder]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are you pretty happy right now? Well, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, the follow-up to that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> Netflix anime, will make you nice and miserable when it arrives.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51617/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-now-in-production">revealed</a> this past weekend that the upcoming series, which'll deliver a fresh standalone tale set in Night City, is currently in production. Animation studio Trigger have returned to work on Edgerunners 2, with Kai Ikarashi directing and Bartosz Sztybor wearing many hats as writer/showrunner/producer. Right, from here on there'll be spoilers for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-finally-slides-its-futuristic-motorbike-onto-netflix-today">first Cyberpunk Edgerunners series</a>, so you've been warned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We didn't get a release date for the 10 episode series as part of this official announcement that Edgerunners 2 is in the works, with CD Projekt only revealing that it'll be hitting Netflix "in the future". Which, er, yeah. There was a teaser, though, which was very clear that the first Edgerunners series' protagonist has definitely kicked the bucket.</p>
<p>"David is dead," it declares amid shots of Cyberpunky anime people doing Cyberpunky anime things, "but Night City lives on." Thankfully, there was a bit more info than that, with multiple hat wearer Sztybor outlining that you can expect "a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>That said, one aspect of the first series will be definitely coming to Edgerunners 2, with the writer telling folks on the Tweeter to "be prepared for sadness". Yep, Edgerunners famously wasn't afraid to leave you feeling like you'd just been kicked in the cybernuts and exposed to massive amounts of onion chopping, and you'd better get ready for something like that again.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2503793299">the panel</a> that featured the Edgerunners 2 announcement, Sztybor <a href="https://x.com/sztybor_writes/status/1941300471546904696">outlined his approach to human stories in dystopian worlds</a> with some all-time quotes. Are you Polish? Thoughts on the below welcome:</p>
<blockquote>We're the company from Poland. I'm from Poland. People in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad...when people are sad, I'm a bit happy.</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, start stocking up on tissues and maybe setting aside some time to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman">slide</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-seeing-more-players-than-it-has-since-launch">five thousandth Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough</a> once CD Projekt release that final, final, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">final patch</a> they recently pushed back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-gets-its-first-teaser-and-youd-better-be-prepared-for-sadness]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week was a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">cancellations, layoffs and general immiseration</a>, so let's attempt to bless this one with some introductory dad jokes.</p>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone tech support? You see, her legs wouldn't quit. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone <em>Minecraft</em> tech support? You see, her logs wouldn't cut. Did you hear about the femme fatale with a very high ping who had to withdraw from a Counter-Strike tournament? You see, her lags wouldn't qualify her for competing in a professional esport. True enough, all of these witticisms are an offence against nature and you should write better ones in the comments.

<h2>Monday 7th July</h2>
<li>Time-poor players rejoice, for annual speedrunning festival <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Summer Games Done Quick</a> is now underway. It got started on Sunday, actually, but today is when the any%ing begins in earnest. Viewer donations go to Doctors Without Borders - they've rustled up around $179,000 so far.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 8th July</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/">Missile Command Delta</a> is Missile Command but turn-based and played inside a game in which you explore a sinister, puzzle-filled base. Someday, one of these batshit Atari revivo-splicings will stick the landing. Will 8th July be that someday? Or will it simply be the first day of <a href="https://www.developconference.com/">Develop</a> in Brighton, the UK games industry's annual mini-GDC and/or shady late night poker game?</li>
<h2>Wednesday 9th July</h2>
<li>Nothing really catches my eye today, so I'm going to steal a release from Thursday 10th: teampunk punkshooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mycopunk">Mycopunk</a>, which is sort of Destiny but set in a mouldy scrapyard.</li>

<li>Let us plumb some depths. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/occlude">Occlude</a>, you play baleful transmogrifications of Solitaire to unlock access to an occult archive. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everdeep-aurora">Everdeep Aurora</a>, you are a bright-eyed drillcat tunnelling through a bountiful underground Game Boy world. If you're more builder than burrower, there are archipelagoes to decorate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">Islanders: New Shores</a>.</li>
<h2>Friday 11th July</h2>
<li>Time to drag a small child kicking and screaming through the snow in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3775050/DOGWALK/">Dogwalk</a>. Or send troops screaming and possibly kicking into alien hives via banks of datafeeds in autobattler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a>. Or watch Tony Hawk fall kicking and screaming off his skateboard in the remake du jour, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. There is no kicking and screaming in turn-based mech strategy sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3415580/Death_Ring_Second_Impact/">Death Ring: Second Impact</a>, I think, unless it's one of those awful Evangelion situations where the mechs transmit battle damage to their pilots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to take her pond birds back to the petshop? You see, her Lake Ducks wouldn't quack. Did you hear about the femme fatale who went bankrupt? You see, her long shot investments wouldn't quadruple. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to call off her Roman-themed drinking party? You see, her legionnaires wouldn't quaff. Oh god, I can't stop. Somebody make me stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tony-hawk-eerie-cat-miners-and-all-the-speedrunning-you-can-eat]]></content:encoded>

        <p>The shooter has "already had significant interest", says CTO</p>

            <p>Romero Games <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248">announced last week</a> that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">lost funding</a> for their upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in the wake of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">latest mass layoff spree</a>. According to one employee who spoke to Irish outlet <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/100-staff-laid-off-galway-romero-games-6753674-Jul2025/">The Journal</a> (the studio is based in Galway), Romero Games have now closed, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The closure has affected 100 workers, writer The Journal, with one anonymous staff member calling it "a big shock" - especially since they'd had meetings with "the publisher" the day before. While the publisher aren't named directly, former staff have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346499500342935553/">mentioned Microsoft cuts</a> in their announcements.</p>

<p>The anonymous staffer had "suspected something might be coming given recent layoffs at Microsoft," write the Journal. But, as echoed in Romero Games's statement that they'd "hit every milestone on time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed our internal gates", they assumed the project was progressing well.</p>
<p>“It seemed so far away for us. The title was pretty well developed at the time,” the anonymous staffer told The Journal. For now, they say, the project is "completely closed, and the studio is closed", though add that they're still "trying to find other ways of funding the project."</p>
<p>The unnamed FPS has "already had significant interest", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346939512960299010/">wrote</a> chief technical officer Keith O'Conor in a LinkedIn post offering hiring recommendations for former staff. He described the interest as "really heartening… but right now our priority is making sure our people are taken care of".</p>
<p>John Romero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">announced the shooter in 2022</a>, a new IP made in Unreal Engine 5. Details have remained scant since. Prior to this, Romero's most recent new FPS project was his and Adrian Carmack's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blackroom-romero-carmack">Blackroom</a> - a game full of "ruined Victorian mansions", "wild west ghost towns" and "treacherous pirate galleons", itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romero-kickstarter-cancelled-for-gameplay-demo">cancelled in 2016</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps]]></content:encoded>
