            <p>The announcement of a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer for the first time in 18 years was a welcome <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tokyo-xtreme-racer-is-returning-after-18-years-with-a-new-game-coming-to-steam-next-year">surprise at the end of 2024</a>. It now has a release date: January 23rd. It's an Early Access launch, but I am excited to drive a gaudy monstrosity on a Japanese highway.

<p>When it was announced, there wasn't much more to see of TXR than some logos and a screenshot of a road. As it stands, there are more screenshots and trailers now, but they do not suggest an Early Access launch lousy with content. 
</p>
<p>The text of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/">Steam page</a> offers a more robust picture of the game. "Over 200 rival characters each with their own unique storyline have been implemented already. There will also be a total 50 playable cars, and over 180 kilometers worth of the Shuto Expressway to race upon," it says about the state of the game at launch. You'll apparently be able to play the game up to about the halfway mark, "with a focus on SP battle and the car tuning features." 
</p><p>Genki hope to keep the game in Early ACcess for "approximately 4 months", but the actual duration will depend upon player feedback. It'll be $30 when it launches at 8am GMT on January 23rd, with a likely price increase when it hits 1.0.
</p>
<p>I choose to be cautiously optimistic, because it's more fun to imagine this will be great than to fret otherwise. And if it is bad, there's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707900/NIGHTRUNNERS_PROLOGUE/">Night-Runners Prologue to keep that expressway bustling</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Blade Chimera is a cyberpunk metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind the really very good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/touhou-luna-nights">Touhou Luna Nights</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/record-of-lodoss-war-deedlit-in-wonder-labyrinth">Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth</a>. As with Deedlit - one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">favourite 'vanias</a> - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

I don’t know whether it’s just that I’ve been reprogrammed by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal World</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori And The Blind Forest</a> to think of metroidvania protags as acrobatic blobs, but there’s something novel and, dare I say, regal about the imposing figure your character cuts in Blade Chimera, as he somersaults away from energy bolts and lacerates dragons with a whip. Look at his cape! Look at his pony tail! I used to have hair like that. I never had a cape, though.
</p>
<p>
Blade Chimera launched today, and still has a demo. If your interest has been piqued, I’d download that demo pronto, because they’ll likely pull it soon. It casts you as Shin, a cyberpunk demon hunter who doesn’t have a memory but does have a Demon Sword called Lux who can turn into bridges, ropes, and barricades. Demon Swiss Army Knife, morelike. Demon Green Lantern’s Ring, even. When she isn’t being used as a clobbering instrument or platforming prop, Lux also gets to be a ghost lady who can manipulate time. She’s the kind of friend you want when you’re lacerating dragons.
</p><p>
The controls might take a teeny bit of getting used to, if you’re new to the dev’s work– there’s a stateliness to movement that may feel stifling. I'm sure you'll persist, though, because the animations and art are swish. Again: his cape! His hair! The last time I had hair like that was before the Millennium Bug. In terms of how it differs from Team Ladybug's previous games, the map is apparently “far larger”. I’m not sure I like the cyberpunk backdrop’s abundance of metallic grey surfaces, next to Deedlit's faerie labyrinth, but it’s a handsome production regardless.
