            <p>Good news for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a>-owning Nic Reubens of the world: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will, unlike its narrow-eyed predecessor, natively support stretchy displays up to the 21:9 format when it finally releases tomorrow. Silksong marketing-man-at-large Matthew Griffin shared some demonstrative screenshots <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963104885722730672">on Xitter</a>, confirming that it won’t require any of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1566566333">weird bodging</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> did to fill out those bigger screens.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s not of great concern to the metroidvaning masses: Steam’s most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">hardware survey</a> suggests that players whose primary monitor tots up to either 2560x1080 or 3440x1440, the two most common 21:9 resolutions, make for less than 4% of users. But dammit, accounting and accommodating for offbeat niches is what PC gaming does best, and Silksong launching with ultrawide support indicates it was built as such from the start. That’s important, as modding in or otherwise forcing ultrawide ratios on games that weren’t expecting them can sometimes reveal, around the edges, visual clunkiness that innocent 16:9 eyes were never meant to see. Unloaded chunks of level, enemies whose animations haven’t started yet, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>It’s the second positive update on Silksong’s techy credentials in recent days, after it was quietly marked as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> Verified on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">Steam store page</a>. That was arguably more of a formality, given the original runs and controls just fine on Valve’s handheld, and Silksong (while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">prettier to my eyes</a>) doesn’t seem to make much in the way of extra hardware demands. Though speaking of resolutions, Hollow Knight never officially supported the Deck’s 16:10 aspect ratio either – I confess that I forgot to check this when I played Silksong at Gamescom last month, but you’d think that if 21:9 is doable, 16:10 would be an absolute doddle.</p>
<p>We’ll find out tomorrow (Thursday 4th September), I suppose, when Silksong finally beats the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> allegations. Here be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">exact release times</a>.</p>

Another one for the "not news, but news to me" pile: you can download a free updated version of classic 4X space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Starships Unlimited from creator Andrew "APEzone" Paul Ewanchyna's website. Originally released in 1999 - an era of relative mental calm, before the Broadband Blight - it's a turn-based affair with four ages of technology to discover, a range of alien factions who (in the original version, anyway) all look like gurning hoover attachments, and the prospect of zesty tactical combat involving ships of your own design. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There are few pleasures in the games journalist's life richer and more poignant than the opportunity to write about a game you'd totally forgotten you played. I didn't recognise Starship Unlimited at first, when I saw it on the 4X subreddit. The madeleine-soaked-in-tea moment was a screenshot of ships in orbit featuring firing ranges - arcs and wedges of yellow, red and green painted onto an invisible tabletop around each craft. I adored those firing ranges as a kid. I used to field highly specialised fleets consisting of acutely near-sighted, 360-degree firing escort cruisers and tunnel-vision artillery vessels that couldn't win a dogfight against a cactus.
</p>
<p>
The free version <a href="https://apezone.com/posts/201114/">available on APEzone's site</a> is Starships Unlimited 3.5 - sadly, Ewanchyna doesn't seem to have preserved the older versions, including the one I played with the (imo) very <em>best</em> nozzle-faced aliens. If you're interested, you'll need to sign up with your email to access the download page.</p>
<p>As ever with these projects, part of the thrill is the weird time-traveller condescension that comes from digesting a set of two-decades old system requirements. 50MB of HD space? Woah, guess I'll have to suck it up and delete my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> install. 64MB of RAM? I'd better close all applications before starting this game. Vintage spec sheet notwithstanding, Starship Unlimited seems to run happily enough on a current-gen Windows PC, like the Dell thinkpad I'm writing this on.
</p>
<p>
Stumbling on this has charged my torpedo tubes and suffused my phaser banks with rampant enthusiasm for games involving genuinely tactical fleet combat. Any lesser-known favourites you'd like to share? Anything new and unexpected, or old and unfairly overlooked?
