            <p>I currently do not have time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyber-knights-flashpoint">Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</a>, the game Katherine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-spiritual-successor-to-invisible-inc-is-finally-here">called </a> a "spiritual successor" to (unbelievably good stealth tactics game) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invisible-inc">Invisible Inc</a>. So, I'm writing about its release from early access as a sort of vicarious joy substitute. Because, boy, does it tick several big honking megaboxes for me. The idea is that you'll be pulling off cyberpunky heists with a squad of mercs, planning and executing while keeping the future fuzz off your backs. There's also lots of dense <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> multiclassing stuff I'll talk about in a second. Here's a launch trailer.</p>

<p>"A modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more," begins the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/">Steam description</a>. More of this, please. Don't tell me how immersed I'll be in your visceral yet cerebral yet emotional journey that represents a bold evolution of (genre). Tell me about the specific (genre) design you're personally into and are very excited about having shoved into your game. There's more. Customisable weapons. Faction reputation. 40 multiclass combinations. A variety of admirable hairdos. There's even some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Human Revolution style hacking minigames.</p>
<p>I am chuffed this exists, evidently, although I am just trailer-gawking. For a more sober and detailed take, do read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rally-point-cyber-knights-flashpoint-is-both-worth-playing-and-worth-waiting-for-a-little-longer">Sin's rally point on the game</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The design goal is, I think, to represent stealth as vital, but not the entirety of your tactics. If you're feeling spicy you can hit a job loud, counting on speed and firepower over waiting for the sentry to chase the shiny penny. Almost all gunfights should feature rolling, repositioning, moving towards a target or shooting your way out before reinforcements catch up. Rather than a stealth/combat binary there's room for degrees of both, sometimes simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bah! I am already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/battle-prose">managing one party of mercs regularly</a>, but it now seems like I'll need to make room in my life for another.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4010">Glory Holes Of Oblivion</a> is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> mod that lets you shoot arrows and cast spells through holes in gates, and also allows your enemies to do the same. Cheers <a href="https://www.exresearch.co/">Ex Research</a> for the spot. NexusMods lists Glory Holes Of Oblivion as containing 'adult content'. This is surely because they're not scholars of glassblowing or drawers. More on this in a second. First, here's a good skeleton demonstrating the use of the mod.</p>

<p>Right: etymology time, buckaroos. Whoop whoop. This is a good one, too. The <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/glory%20hole">original meaning </a>of the term 'glory hole' seems to be "a drawer or box where things are heaped together in a disorderly manner". This pleases me because I've spent my entire life just calling them 'stuff drawers". I have one to my right as I'm typing this. It contains: Post-it notes, batteries, guitar picks, a single micro USB cord, Hall's Soothers, some screws, and a small remote for a lamp I'll never use because I only like one of its changeable hues. According to the (single, repeated around the internet a lot, might be therefore be bollocks) source, the use of 'glory' here likely comes from the Scottish 'glaur' - "to make muddy, dirty, defile".</p>
<p>Yes, skeleton. I'll be with you in a second.</p>
<p>For our next glorious fact, you need to pop yourself over to the 1849 book <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Curiosities_of_Glass_Making/OI80AQAAMAAJ">Curiosities of Glass Making (With Details of the Processes and Productions of Ancient and Modern Ornamental Glass Manufacture)</a>. On page 65, you'll find an illustration of today's subject, described as "the mouth of a pot heated by beech-wood, and called the Glory Hole". This was used to reheat large objects following the processing of 'annealing', or slowly cooling to remove internal stresses. According to our first source, this likely comes from a different  'glory' - which had come to suggest a "circle or ring of light" by the 1690s.</p>
<p>As for modernity, its earliest recorded usage is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_hole#History">a 1707 court case</a>, with the rise of the glory hole coinciding with the need to be discreet in a society that simply refused to be normal about queer people. Luckily, things are fine now, providing you eat this delicious meal of black mould J.K Rowling has prepared for you like it's the introduction to Resident Evil 7, and ask absolutely no follow up questions.</p>
<p>None of this information is, I imagine, factored into this mod. But this means little to the skeleton, who is still doomed. Lmao.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I need help identifying an Ossic Ring. Whatever an Ossic Ring is, it's related to a serpent goddess and is great at keeping away vermin. Legend holds that you can hear it hissing. I'm not sure if the Ossic Ring is an actual ring, and if so, whether it's a ring for your finger or a ring necklace or a ring design found on something unhelpfully nonringular.</p>
<p>With time running short (I am playing the demo for Bad Viking's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a> on the train), I grab weird knick knacks from my shelves at random and thrust them imperiously at the customer. Perhaps this berringed corpse's hand? No? How about this iron band enclosing a blue crystal tear? I get it wrong three times in a row and my character's brain saturates with Dread. To dispel the Dread, I must play a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle">farkle</a>-style dice game, matching faces to sigils before my soul collapses. Ah, this is just like recommending guest beers at the gastropub I worked in before getting my first job in the shitpost business. Do Strange Ales next, Bad Viking.</p><!--more-->

<p>As you may guess from the title, Strange Antiquities is essentially 2022's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a> but you are running a magic antiquarian store rather than a magic garden centre. I haven't played much of Strange Horticulture, but the broad strokes of Strange Antiquities seem identical to those of the verdant puzzler Alice B (RPS in peace) described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strange-horticulture-review">"quiet, meticulous, delightful, dark, and beguiling"</a>. Ding the bell and customers materialise from the green streets of Undermere to ask for a particular item - a bony emblem to aid with the hunt, for example, or a Moon Heart to provide solace for a lonely grandmother. You then work out which of your initially unlabelled commodities fits the bill.</p>
<p>First, you look up the name in an illustrated antiquarian's guide. Then you try to find an artefact that has the right shape, texture, material composition, temperature, smell, sound and psychic resonance. Perhaps you also refer to your book of symbols, which is otherwise used when writing labels. According to Alice B, there was a reward in Strange Horticulture for labelling things very precisely, and I imagine the same is true here.</p>
<p>The appeal of Strange Antiquities, for me, is that it cuts against the disposability of so-called magical artefacts in many other games. Today's RPG-flavoured free-to-play or live service offerings especially are larded with eldritch geegaws, frou-frous and doodads that exist to be fed continually into progression systems. They are glittering sequins on the face of a slot machine.</p>
<p>Strange Antiquities wants you to run curious hands over every dusty Ascendant Shard or poundshop Holy Grail and diagnose its aura. There's a patent loveliness to this. Between sales, you'll also investigate the interior of the shop, which is full of locked compartments and peculiar mechanisms. As in Horticulture, there's a wider world to glean from customer requests, troubled dreams, and expeditions to recover artefacts that take place on a paper map.</p>
<p>My chief criticism, I guess, is that the occult elements don't feel very occluded. Yes, you have to figure out the lore, but there's no doubt that everything in stock is a potential Lament Configuration. I think the game would be more engrossing if the objects at your disposal appeared mostly or entirely devoid of supernatural import, and you had to impose and cultivate those associations by striving to fulfil orders. But that would be a very different game. This one will probably be quite enchanting enough if you adored Horticulture. The demo launches on 5th June.

            <p>Oh boy. Remember the AI-voiced Darth Vader NPC Epic recently added to Fortnite? The one that very quickly had to patched because it wouldn't stop <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-chatbot-why-does-this-exist">saying bad words</a>, and has since become the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">subject of action</a> from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> union? Well, it'll be getting some AI NPC siblings later this year, with Epic planning to give creators the tools to create their own.</p>
<p>AI Vader, which was created in collaboration with the family of actor James Earl Jones, got its own streamer reaction montage at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjikvaR0i34">State of Unreal showcase</a> during which these upcoming AI NPC tools were announced - one that naturally didn't feature any of the clips of it swearing or saying slurs.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>"As game developers, our job is to entertain players and AI is ultimately a tool to make games more fun and immersive," said Epic's Fortnite ecosystem EVP Saxs Persson, "It enables infinite possibilities for two-way dialogue just like we saw with Darth Vader, and as the next step we want to take what we've learned and share the underlying technology with you."</p>
<p>In practice, players will mess around with a new "Persona Device" to create AI NPCs, picking the type of voice and delivery they want for the character, as well as its "characteristics". This was demoed on stage via an AI NPC taking on the role of "a mysterious cosmic entity named Mr Buttons", tasked with persuading the player to press a big red button with "comedic finesse". It'd have earned surreal points with me was I not a bit preoccupied with the ethics of using AI to voice NPCs.</p>
<p>After all, this is just the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the ethics of using generative AI for voice acting. The aforementioned SAG-AFTRA and a host of voice actors have opposed it, arguing that it poses a potential threat to human VAs' livelihoods, with the union having called a strike that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">still ongoing</a> as of writing. SAG-AFTRA, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">drawn some criticism</a> of its own for striking deals with a companies which employ generative AI.</p>
<p>I'd say being sworn at by Darth Vader isn't that immersive. Then again, I struggle to get too hung up on immersion in games that can see you be 360 no-scoped by Mace Windu, who then promptly hits the griddy and gets obliterated by the OP combat skills of Sabrina Carpenter or a sentinent banana. If you want a more nuanced, in-depth view on the genAI in games debate, it's worth checking out Michael Cook's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares essay series</a> on the issue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Tron is a world that I feel constantly surprised by its perseverance in just flat out still being a thing all these years later. And yet, I never feel upset about it given that the vibes of Tron just absolutely rule no matter the context in which they're being delivered, the upcoming Jared Leto led film notwithstanding because of that guy's whole vibe. In terms of what's actually next for the fictitious video game world, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> from the folks over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bithell-games">Bithell Games</a>, and as it so happens, there's a demo out for it today!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/">available on Steam</a>, apparently makes up the first hour of the game, which certainly sounds like a healthy amount of time to suss out its vibes. In case you missed the announcement on this one, Tron: Catalyst is a top-down, sort of but not quite isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game where you play as Exo, a courier whose life gets shaken up by a mysterious package exploding leaving him with unusual abilities.
</p>
<p>
It's set in the Arq <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grid">Grid</a>, a location previously established in Bithell Games' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a>, a visual novel set in the Disney-owned universe. Storywise, the Arq Grid is a bit unstable, with glitches causing time to loop, and only Exo can see them. Lots of good stuff to latch onto here, and yes, you do have a Disc to fight with and a Light Cycle to ride around on, everything you'd want from a Tron game is here.
</p>
<p>
If you're not the demo type, one, did you never buy a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the 2000s, and, two, that's fine, because it's due out on June 17th, just a couple of weeks away. I'm sure that's enough time to get some distance from the launch of the Switch 2, and Summer Game Fest, and tomorrow's PlayStation showcase, and the millions of other showcases happening in way too short of a timespan.

Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-mindseye-even-with-your-first-actual-gameplay-trailer-i-still-dont-believe-youre-a-real-game">I questioned whether MindsEye was a real game or not</a>. This week, that question lingers. Why, you ask? Well, as spotted by our good friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two executives at the studio behind the game, Build a Rocket Boy, have now departed the company. Let me just check when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> is coming out… oh, that's right, literally one week from today. Surely this is only good news!

In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADDOgdoB1gzNggnuaGLIXM_FUprl3u0285o">LinkedIn post</a> from yesterday, now former chief legal officer Riley Graebner shared news of his departure after three and a half years at the company, saying he was "proud" of what the team has accomplished in that time. Former chief financial officer Paul Bland doesn't seem to have made an announcement of his exit per se, but the experience section of his own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn account</a> lists his time at Build a Rocket Boy as ending in June (typically roles listed on LinkedIn will say "present" if a person is still at the company).
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but two executives leaving a studio, no matter their position, doesn't scream "incoming success story." There could be any myriad of reasons as to why they've left of course, this is just speculation, the timing is just a bit odd so close to release for such high level positions.

Thus far hardly any actual gameplay of MindsEye has been shown off, though publisher IO Interactive did announce a showcase for this Friday, June 6th, where more of it will be shown off. Will it be overshadowed by IO's own James Bond game that's also getting a proper look-in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-is-the-new-james-bond-game-from-hitman-makers-io-interactive">now revealed to be called 007 First Light</a>? Almost certainly, but at least there might be more than five minutes of gameplay this time around.
