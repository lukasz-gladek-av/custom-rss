            <p>
I wasn't expecting it personally, but it seems like the new hotness is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, 'ey? Sure, it's from a studio like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/level5">Level-5</a>, who've made massive games from Yo-kai Watch to Professor Layton. I just didn't expect a sequel to a 3DS game from over a decade ago to do so well. In fact, it appears Level-5 is so happy with how much money everyone's given them, it'll be giving away a free bit of DLC for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> at some point in the future.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The DLC is called "<a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">Update the World!</a>" which is a wonderful little title, and a sentence I'd expect from some anime villain obsessed with tech who wants to install a new operating system on Earth, or something. In terms of what it'll include, there'll be "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources." 
</p>
<p>
Maybe that'll mean more quests, or side activities, I'm not entirely sure, it's pretty vague. Though perhaps not as vague as the fact that there'll be "new recipes added" in the DLC too. Yummy, I love recipes! Level-5 also promised that they will "continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time."
</p>
<p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this bit of DLC, kind of seems like a "we sold lots of copies so we can announce this but we're not quite ready for it yet" type of announcement. Either way, there's already lots to be getting on with given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alternate-between-14-lives-in-level-5s-latest-open-world-fantasy-rpg-out-on-pc-this-week">you've got 14 lives to choose from</a>, an existentially terrifying point that I won't spend too much time on.
