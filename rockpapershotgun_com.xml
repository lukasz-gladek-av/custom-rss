Remember Secret Level, that Amazon show that came out last December? I wouldn't blame you if you already forgot about it, for the most part it was pretty forgettable considering how much of it could be boiled down to "damn… video games are violent, huh?", except positioning that as universally cool, actually (let's leave that whole conversation there). Easily the weirdest of all the episodes was the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> one, given that it was only Pac-Man in the sense that there was a floating yellow orb thing that kind of looks like the titular, iconic video game character.
</p>

<p>
Really, though, it's about some humanoid alien being told to eat everything it comes across by this orb, called Puck (get it?), resulting in something that's admittedly intriguingly alarming and grotesque, but also has such ridiculously high levels of edgy animated short film from the early days of YouTube energy. Three days after this episode came out, there came the surprise reveal that this episode is getting a Metroidvania video game adaptation called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, for reasons I couldn't begin to understand.

And now, thanks to the powers that be at Nintendo during today's Direct, a release date has been confirmed for the confusing game: July 18th. The release date announcement came with a snazzy new trailer that revealed you also get a mech? Honestly, the whole thing is unheard of levels of silly, I'm still struggling to believe that this is a real game that's been greenlit, but hey ho, perhaps we've got a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> on our hands.
</p>
<p>
Still can't quite tell if the story will be the exact same as the Secret Level episode, there's some big discrepancies (and a much bigger <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata vibe to it), so we'll all just have to wait a few more months to find out.

When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).
</p>

<p>
The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.
