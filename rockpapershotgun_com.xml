            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s shift from early access to full release came with heap of tweaks and changes as Larian finalised their huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Naturally, this meant certain bits or plans not making it into the final cut, and if you've come to long for any of those after playing them initially or hearing about them, then odds are a new mod is right up your alley. It's also really cool if you, you know, just want more BG3.</p>

<p>The mod's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description">Early Access Scenes Restored</a>' by modding whiz HyperspaceTowel, who's been working on restoring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17511">bits</a> of early access Baldur's Gate 3 for a little while now. This latest creation's the culmation of all that effort, delivering a bunch of restored "deleted scenes, encounters, and NPCs" in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>According to the modder, that's "over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue" so far, with plans to keep adding more going forwards. Making that up are the likes of chats with resurrected early access characters, camp chats, and companion reactions to the various stuff you get up to. HyperspaceTowel explains that most of these returning bits were a case of bringing back an early access scene as "pretty much a 1:1 transplant" with minor camera or dialogue tweaks, though there were some that had to be "built from the ground up based on the scraps I could find".</p>

<p>The modder cites shell-collecting kid Lotan, whose reconstructed chat's shown in the video above, as an example of the latter. Among the other revived NPCs or chats you can expect to run into include would-be music box seller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9-w9ovbn8">Nerela</a>, some enthralled fishermen, Shadowheart issuing an ultimatum, and Gale channeling his best Nigella Lawson as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSvKArS4ac&amp;t=3s">yacks about his deer stew</a>.</p><p>HyperspaceTowel's opted to stick to including bits of early access BG3 which fit into the final version of the game, which means the likes of early Wyll and Karlach - plus some romance scenes featuring Gale and the former - have been left to go into another mod or mods which'll keep non-can stuff separate. They've also opted to keep separate a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/20098">freshly restored quest</a> surrounding whether or not to chow down on a hermit crab. The reason in that case looks primarily to be the fact the files it's been restored from are very old, so some of the dialogue lacks voice files.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing what these restored early access encounters add to your next BG3 playthrough, the good news is that the main restoration mod appears not to require any other framework mods to work. However, you will want to make sure you kick off a new run once you've installed it and avoid ditching it midway through a playthrough you plan to finish.</p>

            <p>Mawning all and happy new week to the sickos who celebrate the return of Monday. It’s time for another helping of cosmic despair as we slide irresistibly down the Gullet of Entropy, pawing in vain at the Tonsils of Hubris. Also, some new PC game releases. Maybe save your pennies for Wednesday and Thursday, which are uncommonly rammed. </p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 26th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s time for John Highguard to guard high in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Highguard</a>, the Keighley-anointed sci-fantasy raid shooter that has attracted more critical writing pre-release than most games get in total by virtue of 1) it being made by former Apex Legends and Titanfall devs 2) nobody knowing a goddamn thing about how it plays</li>
<li>Oh no, John Highguard has been sucked into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">Winnie’s Hole</a> (early access), this being a frightful cosmic horror roguelite based on the hitherto-cuddly A.A. Milne character. Battle through the Hundred Acre Forest as Winnie while mutating his insides using block-shaped viruses. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 27th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>For many years now, people have been trying to make ‘Minecraft survival with airships’ a thing, and failing. I don’t understand why it hasn’t caught on. I love airships. Anyway here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644050/Echoes_of_Elysium/">Echoes Of Elysium</a>, launching into early access with six player co-op and a “vast procedural clockwork world”.</li>
<li>Created by the fearful bounders behind The Swindle and Lair of the Clockwork God, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">Earth Must Die</a> is a point-and-click* sci-fi comedy about an alien failson emperor, featuring a sparkling VA cast.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1727590/THE_SPIRIT_LIFT/">The Spirit Lift</a> is a Buffy-core roguelite deckbuilder romp about teens exploring a haunted hotel, floor by floor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 28th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">Roots Devour</a> you are the absolute worst tree. Extend your tendrils through the forest, drinking the blood of non-sylvan lifeforms and deciding whether to merely witness or prey upon a furtive population of humans.</li>
<li>DON’T LET THEM IN unless they genuinely just want to buy pasta and chips in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Hellmart</a> - a horror game about being a supermarket clerk, in which smiling customers are to be regarded with suspicion.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3278310/LANESPLIT/">Lanesplit</a> is a glossy first-person biking sim by twilight with a touch of the Nicolas Winding Refns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">Ghost Keeper</a> (early access) appears to be a new version of polterzeitgeisty Sims parody Ghost Master. Set up a houseful of haunts without getting exorcised.</li>
<li>Seek out a mysterious signal at the heart of post-apocalyptic Antarctica in slightly Funko Pop-esque survive-o-wander <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054310/Nova_Antarctica/">Nova Antarctica</a>. You'd think vanilla Antarctica was already apocalyptic enough, but they had to go the extra thousand miles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 29th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>There have been over 30 Resident Evils and we’ve still yet to kill all the videogame zombies. Here to finish the job, maybe, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers/">The Midnight Walkers</a> (early access), a first-person extraction shooter set in a megamall with a timed poison gas system.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211850/Calyx/">Calyx</a> (early access) is an RTS in which you pit a conventional military force against a steady tide of ravenous plantlife.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085910/Feastopia/">Feastopia</a> is an atypically edible, Against The Storm-inspired roguelite city-builder in which you must supply better and better food to an infant god, or else end up on the menu.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a> is the self-explanatory sequel to/escalation of Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Cairn</a> is a thoughtful, heavily-laden climbing adventure from the makers of Furi and Haven.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">I Hate This Place</a> is a comicbook-inspired survival crafting horror in the tradition of Darkwood. It sees an 80s girl investigating the mysterious Horned Man, while fighting spiders and mutants.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">Don’t Stop, Girlypop</a> is a Y2K arena shooter with sherbet in its veins, a crystal flip phone in one hand, and some kind of pink chrome lipstick launcher in the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362060/CODE_VEIN_II/">Code Vein 2</a> is Bandai Namco’s latest anime Soulslike with a time-travelling, fix-the-past-to-save-the-NPC premise and some crackpot character designs and outfits. There is a bell-waving octopus gunship and your sidekick’s corset is an X-ray screen. Discuss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 30th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half Sword</a> (early access) is a grimdaft physics-based medieval combat game in which you swing by moving the mouse. Expect much clanging and some entrails.</li>
<li>It’s time for a remake of turn-based mech bonanza <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3795900/FRONT_MISSION_3_Remake/">Front Mission 3</a>. Ah, I remember playing this briefly on PS1. I think I was lured away from it by Alundra 2, in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question for the comments thread: how do I stop Steam game pages autoplaying trailers when shuffling the top media display? It routinely scares the pants off me when I have several tabs open. Some day, Gabe Newell will pay for his crimes. In the shorter term, the RPS team are spending this week thinking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, Yakuza, Arknights Endfield and various secret things.</p><p>What are you up to? Nothing good, I hope. Let us know if there's a recommendation-worthy game we've skipped. I left a few out because I'm utterly aghast at your apathy on this front. Don't let me tell you what to like. Show me you have guts and a little spine! Not like the lady in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/code-vein">Code Vein</a> 2, though.</p>

According to the folks behind the campaign, the European Union have been able to verify that 1,294,188 of the petition's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">nearly 1.5 million signatures</a> are the real deal, putting it above the one million signature goal required for EU politicians to look into the issue of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">server shutdowns rendering online-only games impossible to play</a>.</p>

<p>"Things are moving quite fast right now, and we’ve decided to share the final count with you ahead of schedule," volunteer Moritz Katzner wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qluxts/stop_killing_games_final_count_of_verified/">a Reddit post</a> which includes a breakdown of the verified signatures by country.  "Originally, this wasn’t possible due to certain background limitations, and our plan was to wait until shortly before our next meeting with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>"At that point, we intended to reveal everything through a video, alongside a redesigned website, a restructured Discord, and several other updates that - ironically - I still can’t talk about just yet. We didn’t want to present our case unprepared, unintentionally leak information to lobby groups, or worst of all burn out our team."</p>
<p>According to the breakdown, the largest signature total a single country contributed to the petition was 233,180 from Germany, followed by France with just over 145,000, and Poland with around 144,000. Katzner expanded a bit further on the relatively low number of signatures - at least in the context of the overall total - which have turned out not to be valid.</p><p>"I’d say we’re definitely in the top three when it comes to low rates of failed signatures," he wrote in a comment on the post. "We’re sitting at around 10%, while the best-performing initiatives tend to fall in the 10–15% range, which puts us firmly in the upper bracket. Some initiatives see failure rates as high as 20–25% and still manage to get over the line, but it’s worth noting that the overall sample size is quite small, only 11 initiatives."</p>
<p>While a wait for the campaign's organisers to begin meeting with EU lawmakers and properly discussing the issue looks to be on the cards for now, the group have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qlknp0/stop_killing_games_announcement_on_anthem/">seperately announced plans</a> to "take some proactive steps" with regards to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">recent shutdown</a> of Bioware's online-only exoshooter Anthem. Those steps have taken the form of providing intructions as to how Anthem owners in France and Germany can report the shutdown to relevant consumer rights organisations. The hope is that getting in touch with the <a href="https://www.quechoisir.org/">Federal Union of Consumers - Que Choisir</a> and <a href="https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/">Verbraucherzentrale</a> might help those who bought the game secure refunds, with establishing "more generalised international reporting mechanisms for any games killed in the future" being one of Stop Killing Games' goals going forwards.</p>
<p>The Stop Killing Games campaign was the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">a debate in UK parliament</a> late last year. Recently, a small group of UK Green Party members <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-green-party-mps-would-be-compelled-to-support-stop-killing-games-if-a-proposed-policy-amendment-passes">revealed plans to propose an amendment to policy</a> which would "compel" their MPs to support Stop Killing Games, were it to pass a vote at the party's next conference.</p>
