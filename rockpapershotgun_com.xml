The tastiest thing you can currently do in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haneda-girl">Haneda Girl</a> is eject yourself from your mech straight into a streaking katana blow that carries you though a door and two torsos before teleport-summoning your mech as though inflating a lifejacket to gun down three other mooks in a giddy gout of purple gore. OK, that’s more than one thing. It is, according to local experts, a combo. What are combos good for? Score multipliers, that’s what. Here is a trailer. Ware the techno.

In this action-platform stealth me-do from Studio Koba, you’re a juvenile coin-op junkie who has been piped Tron-style into an arcade game to “save Data Empire from the frightening (and intense) Hackernauts.” Each level is a tidy 2D breach-and-clear puzzlebox in which you can stomp around in your M.O.T.H.E.R mecha, or platform on foot like a sucker. While inside the mecha you have Gatling guns and shields, but you’re too hefty to fit through doors. While on foot, meanwhile, you can run up walls and backstab people, but you can also be slain in one hit. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Haneda Girl can teleport-summon the mecha without penalty, so there’s no need to commit to either style, save for when you’re constrained by an obstacle such as an inconsiderately human-sized passage or a katana-proof fractured surface. The Steam blurb has some helpful, slightly insulting advice: “I am fearful and conservative = use M.O.T.H.E.R”; “Some days I get the nerve = Swap between M.O.T.H.E.R and Haneda”; “I am very forward = Haneda Girl (no doubts)”. 
</p>
<p>
To put all that another way, you will “move like in Celeste”, “destroy like in Bro Force”, “slash like in Katana Zero”, and “die like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>”. Woah, save some touchstones for the rest of us, Studio Koba! There’s wearing your influences on your sleeve, and then there’s bulletpointing them as verbs. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, Haneda Girl has a few fresh ideas of its own. The dual character setup harbours a nifty symbiotic resourcing element. When Haneda Girl ejects from the cockpit, the mecha’s shields are restored; when she summons the mecha, it also replenishes her superdash attacks. So the more you switch, the more capable you’ll be, and the more you’ll feel like weaving the mech and pilot elements into a gratifying techno pretzel.</p>
<p>Given some appropriately devious level design, I think these fundamentals could really sing. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169790/Haneda_Girl/">a demo on Steam</a>. The full game releases on 23rd May.

Sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a> is the first game from Reburn, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">a new incarnation of Metro co-developers 4A Games Ukraine</a>. It's out now in early access. That last bit is a surprise: the developers had planned to release the new shooter as "a large, complete journey", but had to make "certain pivots" in the face of resource constraints, technical complications and, presumably, the broad impacts of living in a warzone. This led to a launch delay last week and then, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2282350/view/512957012199342081?l=english">the abrupt announcement</a> that La Quimera would start out as an early access project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've played the first of the early access build's four missions, and yeah, it all feels a bit undercooked, though I feel like the problem is less execution than concept. La Quimera simply doesn't feel like a very enthralling shooter, next to the developer's previous post-apocalyptic Moscow tunnel escapades.</p>
<p>It's set in a futuristic travesty of Latin America that is sort of Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare trying to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> by way of Horizon: Zero Dawn, with neo-Aztec megacities and verdant metal ruins full of feral bots. You play a PMC trooper who embarks on a straightforward rescue mission and is promptly swept up in wider technofeudal shenanigans, which usefully lead to you becoming a guinea pig for some cybernetic implants.

Said early-game Stroggification brings with it a suite of secondary abilities and upgrades, which I've yet to acquire. They'll need to be exciting indeed, because La Quimera's gunplay is currently rather plodding for what is theoretically more of a power fantasy than Metro. In brief: you hide behind things and pick 'em off one by one till somebody flanks or lobs a grenade - rinse and repeat. There are two broad categories of gun: red types are for dudes, blue types are for drones. The weapons are tricked out and greebled to the max - one of the starting pistols looks like a ghost-busting hairdryer - but they don't (yet) have the storied intimacy of Metro's hydraulic BB guns and drum-fed shotties. They're just flashy gizmos. 
</p>
<p>
You can say similar things of the story and world. The setting is touristy bordering on demeaning - this is one of those localisations where people tactically pepper the English with bits of high-velocity Spanish, as though the other language existed to supply punchlines. The dialogue is also sweary in a way that is <em>almost</em> overcompensatory enough to be charming, like you're witnessing kids utter their very first F-bombs, but mostly just insipid. Still, a lot of thought appears to have gone into the dense and gleaming or gutted and overgrown architecture and geography. It's just a shame La Quimera won't let you explore too far: this appears to be a universe of tunnels and tiered chambers, like Metro, except that being set in the open air, it needs holographic red mission boundaries to stop you wandering off.

<p>
It doesn't feel like a particularly tough game on Normal difficulty. Health must be replenished manually, but the game restores a little out of mercy when you're nearly dead, and there are regular checkpoints to soften the fall when you exhaust your capped supply of medikits. You also have the option of co-op, with players forming up in your hub base before embarking on missions.
</p>
<p>
La Quimera will remain in early access for "up to 18 months". Here's what you'll hopefully get in the full release:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes.
</p>
<p>
- Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations.
</p>
<p>
- Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters.
</p>
<p>
- Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players.
</p>
<p>
- A larger number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I would definitely reserve your pennies for the moment. I can sort of see a serviceable shooter arising from this one's whirl of doodads, bandidos and cussing. Perhaps the later plot developments and fancier upgrades will save it from disaster. Still, if you're after a campaign shooter right now, you're probably better off digging out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a> again.
