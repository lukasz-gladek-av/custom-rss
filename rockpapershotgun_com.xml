            <p>Too many cosy games about mindlessly planting turnips. Not enough cosy games about the house slowly being taken over by viscera. Fractured Blooms is tagged on Steam as "cute" and "anime" and "psychological horror". It was announced at the Summer Game Fest, where presenter Geoff Keighly described the game as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doki-doki-literature-club">Doki Doki Literature Club</a> meets Silent Hill". There's no release date, but here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Kinda afraid to find out what the true story is behind this one. "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730310/Fractured_Blooms/">the Steam page</a>. "Every loop is a strategic game of resource management and discovery. Plan each day carefully to manage your food and stamina. Only by mastering your routine and finding ways around challenging tasks can you dig deeper into the blessed reality around you."</p>
<p>You cook meals, tend the vegetable patch, and wake up every day in slightly new surroundings, and it's all "a deeply personal narrative inspired by a true story. The more you play, the more this broken story blooms. Don’t let them touch you. What are you trying to keep alive?" Okay, as someone keen to see the wholesome game genre eviscerated for once, I'm intrigued.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-builders-journey">Lego Builder's Journey</a> is rare not because it's a Lego game, but because it's a Lego game that actually requires you to do Lego stuff, like build and clack blocks together. So it seems to be with the new game from the same studio, Lego Voyagers. The difference this time is that it's two-player co-op with a more expansive world to explore. It looks grand in the trailer below.

<p>I tried introducing my kid to Builder's Journey a few years back and he didn't click with it. It was too contemplative, too much of a puzzle game for an actual kid to play. Time may well have solved that problem already, but if not co-op should do it, and there also seems to be more of a sense of humour this time around. More swingy physics, anyway.
</p>
<p>Voyagers will also have a Friends Pass, meaning two people can play together with only one purchased copy of the game. That seems pretty essential for co-op games, these days.
</p>
<p>It's being published by Annapurna and developed by Light Brick Studio. There's no specific release date yet except that it's coming in 2025, and you can find more screenshots over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nothing funnier than a sweary muppet. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felt-that-boxing">Felt That Boxing</a> is a PunchOut style comedy fighting game about a weak-armed muppet learning to stick up for himself and the little ones he loves. It was shown off at Summer Game Fest, and the trailer is worth a chuckle.</p>

<p>You play as Ezra "Fuzz-E" Wright, who has opted to fight through the "Tournament of a Million Punches" in order to save an orphanage. The story mode will last about 8-12 hours, they say. Every fight is a boss fight. </p>
<p>"Felt That: Boxing blends tactile, physics-driven combat with responsive controls for a satisfying, skill-based brawling experience," says the Steam page. "Players punch, dodge, block, and super-smack their way through handcrafted arenas inspired by puppet-theater flair and Saturday-morning cartoons."</p>
<p>The studio behind the game, Sans Strings Studio, is headed by Sébastien Deguy, an animator who has been posting <a href="https://x.com/SebDeguy/status/1739030367460532555">muppety mayhem on social media</a> for a while now. Amazing it took this long to create realistic-looking puppets in videogames, to be frank.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
