            <p>Yee-haw. Excuse me, I meant to say that wild west <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> Tombwater has walked into the saloon and ordered a release date. 'I'll have November 12th, 2025', it growled, while flashing its big iron at everyone in the watering hole to show it meant business.</p>
<p>Originally roaming the plains of <a href="https://maxatrillionator.itch.io/tombwater">Itch.io</a>, this funky-looking game comes from Max Mraz, developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oceans-heart">Ocean's Heart</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> tribute <a href="https://maxatrillionator.itch.io/yarntown">Yarntown</a>, and Jake Wagner. The duo have trained their six-shooters on Steam, where you can already find a demo to check out.</p>

<p>You've got a bit of time to do so as well, with that November 12th release still being a little while away. It's not like there are any other big  metroidvaniascoming out in the interim to scratch that itch for you. As far as what you're in for goes, here's Tombwater's story blurb:</p>
<blockquote>Enter Tombwater, where shadows lurk and whispers echo from the deep of abandoned silver mines. This is no longer a town where people live, but a town where people die. A once-thriving community, its people have now been gripped by the tendrils of madness. Step into the well-worn boots of a lone gunslinger, drawn to the eerie, decaying streets by the disappearance of Sheriff Elliott Flintwood — a long-lost friend who’s fought to save the town. Uncover the truth by facing unforgettable terrors and fighting through the madness.</blockquote>
<p>There you go, not-Clint-Eastwood's nowhere to be found, get your bum in some chaps and go fight some eldrich horrors. Those horrors, glimpsed from the game's top-down 2D perspective look pretty freaky too. The deputy's covered in red stuff and bones, and over 20 other boss battles are promised as you explore the likes of canyons and mines with some secrets tucked away.</p><p>I'm a bit bemused at a western being as proud to boast melee weapons, spells and tonic brewing as it is a bunch of pistols, shotguns and repeaters you can use to duel demonic dudes to death, but variety is the spice of life. Well, having someone spit chewing tobacco into your lunch was probably the spice of wild west life, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can check out Tombwater's demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308200/Tombwater/">here</a>.</p>
