            <p>Corporate gaming giant NetEase are hunting for more jobs to slash among their overseas studios, according to insiders who spoke to Bloomberg and Game File last week. The parent company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">cut a bunch of US jobs among their Marvels Rivals developers</a> despite the game raking in a big profit. And it now looks like that was just the start of a larger mauling which may hit up to 20 of the company's non-Chinese studios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years," says Stephen Totilo in a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">report for Game File</a>. "One of Game File’s sources says NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams, leading to the potential closure of more than a dozen game studios, if they can’t secure new post-NetEase funding." </p>
<p>Among the overseas studios owned by NetEase are French studio Quantic Dream, who were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired in 2022</a>, and Nagoshi Studio, a venture set-up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-yakuza-series-director-announces-new-studio-under-netease">a former Yakuza director</a>. The corporate behemoth also own several overseas studios that haven't released a game yet, such as US studio Bulletfarm and Bad Brain Game Studios in Canada, among 16 other studios in various countries. It's not clear which of these studios are on the chopping block. </p>
<p>"[All] studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation," the company told Game File after a request for comment, "and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process.” </p>
<p>NetEase are also partial owners of Polish studio Rebel Wolves, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">recently revealed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood Of Dawnwalker</a>. But they are minority shareholders, as clarified by co-owner Tomasz Tinc <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/">on LinkedIn</a>, who said that Dawnwalker is "fully funded" and not in danger.</p>
<p>"The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," he said.

</p><p>A pattern of cuts to relatively new NetEase studios has already emerged. As noted by Edwin recently, NetEase have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">split with Jar Of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">laid people off</a> at Liquid Swords. All these studios were recently set up by industry veterans who had worked on game series' like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo">Halo</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>. </p>
<p>The move is a strategic set of cutbacks envisioned from on-high, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">Bloomberg</a>, who report that NetEase CEO William Ding has "reasserted his leadership with a series of dramatic decisions over the past year", including hiring a number of 20-something finance graduates to "lead or supervise gaming units", according to the newspaper's sources. </p>
<p>NetEase laid off almost 900 workers from various games subsidiaries over the course of 2023, Bloomberg also notes. But when asked about the status of overseas studios on a conference call last week, Ding responded via translator to say that the company will continue to support "high-quality studios and really master creators.”</p>
<p>“That is our strategy,” he said. “There’s no change on that.”</p>
<p>If you are one of the 448,000 players who played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> at the height of its popularity on Steam, you may be looking at those recently laid off and wondering what counts to Ding as "high-quality". </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-essential-oil-diffusing-fragrance-mouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"The cat is the fragrance, Nic," Ollie once told me when I asked the RPS Slack channel for alternatives to my essential oil diffuser, which I can no longer use for fear of my cat getting vanilla scurvy or lavender botulism or whatever else. I contemplated those words last night when she pounced into bed with me, curled up, and serenaded me to slumber with a briney fart. I remembered them again this morning when I learned of the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/">ASUS Fragrance Mouse</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valve-bans-games-that-rely-on-in-game-ads-from-steam-so-no-watch-this-to-continue-playing-stuff-will-be-making-its-way-to-our-pcs/">Percy Gamer</a>.)</p>
<p>The mouse is ergonomic, wireless, and comes in plain or pink ("Iridescent White or Rose Clay"). Its innards house a refillable vial for scent oils. It features "delicate underglow lighting," a sell  that would be easier to make fun of if most gaming hardware wasn't illuminated by a choice of either energy drink piss green or antiseptic gel blue.</p>

<p>Would I use this if I hadn't a cat? Silly question. I would immediately source a cat. Ah, but what if she was theoretically immune to essential oils and also not sick of being used in dangerous hypotheticals as I assume all cats are by now?</p>
<p>A tendency toward anxious agoraphobia has made me someone who spends a lot time cultivating vibes. I would venture that I own more fairy lights, houseplants, IDM playlists and tiny lamps shaped like mushrooms than most people who don't also use Instagram. I owned both a scent diffuser and an apocalypse bunker's worth of Nag Champa before my cat's arrival meant I had to stop using them. I am, on paper, the exact genre of mark that should fall for this.</p>
<p>And yet, I cannot help but view it as an admission of defeat. As PC Gamer deftly note, the fragrance mouse is "the first development in mouse I've seen in some time that wasn't just 'more button". Its very existence feels like a thwarted admission that there are no new ideas left in the world (of mice) and thus ASUS have resorted to just shoving in things that already exist and, I must assume, are much more suited for the task when they don't also have to fight for space with mouse brains.</p>
<p>Why, if we're just doing that, I bet I could source several better ideas from the morass of Monday morning ennui that is the RPS Slack in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>"A mouse encased in a magic ball that somehow attaches itself firmly to any surface, including your own leg, so that you can wield it dexterously enough to play an FPS without needing a desk," says Edwin.</p>
<p>"A mouse with a mouse's tail; it's fairly unobtrusive most of the time but it sometimes displays excitement or affection, wrapping itself around your wrist or wagging like a dog's when you knock someone in Apex," suggests Ollie.</p>
<p>"A vertical mouse for work that changes into a normal mouse when you want to play a precise FPS. A Transformer mouse," adds Brendy.</p><p>

"A mouse with a pencil sharpener in it. Just for the irony", says James.

</p><p>Me? Idk. A…toaster? Little tiny toaster? Makes you little tiny bits of toast that you can nibble on to make you feel better about burning your fingers on your stupid toaster mouse?</p>
<p>I do not hate the fragrance mouse. Benign bewilderment is an entertaining emotion. However, my desk only has room for one scent.</p>
