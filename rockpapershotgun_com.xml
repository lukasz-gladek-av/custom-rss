            <p>Announced last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-rally-championship">Exo Rally Championship</a> does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>'s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.
</p>
<p>Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

<p>This is no rally game reskin, but takes full advantage of the setting. The landscapes you're speeding across are vast and unforgiving, crater-marked, littered with boulders, and battered by rain, lightning and meteors. It's only possible to make your way across them because your six-wheel-drive rover can catch considerable airtime on the low-gravity planets.
</p><p>Land too hard and you'll lose a wheel or other valuable part of your machine, however. That's where air jets come in, which let you shunt your buggy around in mid-air to correct your orientation or soften your touchdown. The tutorials take you through using them in different scenarios, and it's a lot to consider. Enough that it's simultaneously intimidating but exciting to see what dedicated players can wring from these physics.
</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast to what I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">Exo One review</a>, a game which I felt lacked friction after you'd got to grips with its comparatively simple controls. Exo Rally Championship seems to have friction in spades, and promises a rich simulation with the ability to tune your rover, the need to repair it, and with tire and fuel types to match to different planetary destinations in the full game.
</p>
<p>That full game is still "coming soon", but you can grab the demo now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2262020/Exo_Rally_Championship/">from Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
