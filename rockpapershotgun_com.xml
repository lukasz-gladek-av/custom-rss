            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a sci-fi management game in which you remix your character's life history in a "Quantum Computer" to generate a workforce of deeply disturbed, borderline non-functional clones. In a twist so on-the-nose I can feel its fingers plucking at my olfactory bulb, developers 11 Bit Studios may have used generative AI to spawn or auto-translate parts of the in-game lore - despite the absence of a generative AI disclosure on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>The rumour bubbled up last week, when Reddit user EarthlingKira <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/">posted a screen</a> of an in-game mission log with the phrase "Sure, here's a revised version focussing purely on scientific and astronomical data". It reads pretty obviously like a chatbot response that was accidentally left in the text after it was generated and pasted into the game. Bluesky user Hietor De Paolo has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zitosilva.bsky.social/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b">posted a screen</a> of a piece of dialogue, featuring the phrase "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is..." This suggests that 11 Bit also used ChatGPT or another genAI tool to translate the game's script.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam policies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">require developers</a> to tell players upfront whether they're using generative AI software, though the policy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">so vague as to be totally unhelpful</a>. There is no mention of generative AI on The Alters Steam page at the time of writing. Nor did the developers tell me they were using generative AI when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">broached the subject</a> at an event in Poland last year. They did have a booth at the event that let attendants create and chat to AI personas, but I perhaps naively took this for a stunt dreamed up by the PR team - there was no suggestion that any of it would be part of the game itself.</p>
<p>GenAI continues to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">a Trending Topic, with strong undertones of Discourse</a>. The industry's largest publishers, especially Microsoft, have bet billions on the success of generative AI tools of one kind or another. You can't sign into a Windows laptop these days without being harassed to generate something - go on, do it for uncle Satya Nadella.</p>
<p>While genAI appears to be widely used in game development as a continuation of older, less romanticised automation tools, many developers and creatives are rightly suspicious of the bigger promises around genAI, seeing the supposedly magical artmaking technology as a source of ugliness and error and a threat to their livelihoods, foisted on them by snake oil merchants who, for all their talk of <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/practical-ai-how-ludos-generative-ai-tools-aim-to-help-democratise-game-development/">"democratising"</a> the creative process, are only accountable to their shareholders. Unions have attempted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sag-aftra-union-reach-tentative-agreement-with-game-companies-that-could-end-the-latest-voice-actor-strike">put "guardrails"</a> on genAI in game development, with varying success.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, I wondered whether The Alters' premise of cloning a character from the protagonist's own backstory could be interpreted as a parody of how generative AI bots appropriate and regurgitate existing texts and imagery. Lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me that 11 Bit did consider making your space station's Quantum Computer a talking AI character, but this was not envisaged as an actual genAI bot, nor a commentary on today's genAI tools. "I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public," he said. Wlosek added that he was "very interested" in the discussion around generative AI and that 11 Bit "will be watching closely", but they had no plans to engage with the subject in The Alters.</p>
<p>I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification about the presence of genAI material in The Alters. I feel I should have been more on top of this, as the Rock Paper Servitor who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-alters-review">reviewed The Alters</a> and thought it was, on the whole, pretty decent. In my defence, I didn't spend much time combing the lore bits in the menus, because I was on deadline.</p>
<p>There's been some suggestion on Reddit that translation and optional lore writing are tertiary tasks, and thus, appropriate to hand off to a bot. This seems wildly silly. Translation and localisation are demanding and "creative" pursuits. Languages do not mesh easily - it takes wit and imagination to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-jolly-cooperation-of-localising-dark-souls">capture, say, the peculiarity of Dark Souls dialogue in English</a>. The Alters is about making subtle differentiations between versions of "the same" person. Choice of wording during dialogue was often key to my understanding of each Alter, and I have yet to encounter a chatbot capable of such delicacies. </p>
<p>As for lore document writing, you could say that my inattention to this side of The Alters during my review supports the view that it is an inessential extra. But come now - I don't think anyone can seriously dispute the importance of lore text to a sci-fantasy jobbie such as this.</p>
<p>In any case, the arguments about whether genAI can deliver on these fronts ignore the wider point that genAI is, essentially, just the latest way of trimming costs, shaving away labour and increasing output, to ensure that the industry can continue to be a mechanism of transferring wealth upwards. The Alters really does feel like an allegory for all that, despite 11 Bit's protestations - the basic stakes of the plot are that your employers want you to treat the Alters as bots, even as they protest that they are living beings who deserve a future. But this is a big, sticky issue that we probably need to revisit in op ed form. In the meantime, I'll let you know as and when we get clarity from 11 Bit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure]]></content:encoded>
