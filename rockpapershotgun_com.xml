"Pillars Tactics is a thing that a lot of people at the studio would like to work on, and there are a lot of people that like tactics games," he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2388422071">recently said on a livestream</a>, but they'd need to work out "a scope of development where it feels like it could actually make money."

<p>This isn't the first time Sawyer has mentioned such a project. He said last September that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-pillars-of-eternity-tactics-game-has-been-pitched-by-a-number-of-obsidian-devs-because-fans-will-play-a-lot-of-them-even-if-theyre-not-that-good/">a few developers at Obsidian</a> have "floated" the idea. According to Sawyer, the audience "is not huge, typically, but very passionate. People that are into [strategy] RPGs, tactical RPGs, they'll play a lot of them, even if they're not that good. It's a hard one to make a case for," but "every once in a while we bring it up and go 'oh, we could maybeâ€¦"</p>
<p>The Pentiment dev returned to these sentiments in the recent livestream. "Tactics games have a very enthusiastic fanbase, but the fanbase is not humungous," he said. "It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are gonna buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people."</p>
<p>Obsidian Chief Egg Overseer Feargus Urquhart recently revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/FB9qwiskL18">an Ian Games interview</a> that the studio was still fairly modestly sized for the big budget RPG space, with nearly 300 employees compared to, for example, CD Projekt Red's 615 or Larian's 470 (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-ceo-reveals-its-just-half-the-size-of-many-triple-a-studios-even-as-it-prepares-to-launch-its-4th-game-in-5-years/">thanks PC Gamer</a>). That's not gigantic for a studio that has another RPG project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, following Avowed later this year, so it's not surprising they'd want to be careful with how they allocate resources. Their approach to financials is refreshing too, saying in a recent DICE talk that they go into each project assuming "mild success" rather than gangbusters.</p>
<p>I'm extrapolating a bit here, but it sounds to me like (at the studio level at least) they're a team that want to make money so they can make more games rather than the depressingly common inverse. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Whatever I thought of Avowed</a>, that feels like something to celebrate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
