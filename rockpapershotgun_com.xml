            <p>Remember when you were young, and had your first crush? All of a sudden your hormones are going nuts, and here's this person you can't think about without your face contorting into a goofy smile, or talk about without bashfully giggling. Well, it seems that's how part-time Gearbox exec and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">full-time social media poster</a> Randall Steward Pitchford II feels about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s freshly revealed first DLC Vault Hunter.</p>
<p>It's understandable to be fair. Which of us hasn't found ourselves gazing longingly at a former casino robot dressed like a goth version of John Wayne, before volunteering to help animate its card-throwing? Sometimes, C4SH rules not just everything around you, but your very heart.</p>

<p>C4SH is the name of this cowbot, whom you'll be able to play as if you splash out for him when he arrives alongside the game's first story DLC early next year. The Vault Hunter's "a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts, with his bio continuing that the first story DLC, Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, "is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favour."</p><p>As you might have guessed, C4SH is aimed at folks who like playing in a way that comes with high risk for potentially high reward, with the buckarndroid's skills being deliberately unpredictable. That's all cool, but the more important thing emphasised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE">C4SH's reveal at the Tokyo Game Show</a> is this: Randy Pitchford fucking LOVES him.</p>
<p>"C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common," the exec said during this on-stage reveal, having previously descibed the cowboy robot as "very dear to me, very personal to me." What's engendered these strong feelings in such a famously chill and dispassionate fellow? Well, Pitchford has both won and lost while doing some real life gambling, the CEO said, and he's also a professional magician. "I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game," said the smitten Gearbox skipper.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll have more to share in the coming months about C4SH and Story Pack 1, but for now, check out what's up next in our post-launch roadmap, including our first Seasonal Mini-Event, Bounty Pack, and Invincible Boss. <a href="https://t.co/FUYq5qduqO">pic.twitter.com/FUYq5qduqO</a></p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1972142127967850710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So, if you've ever wondered what it's like to basically be Randy Pitchford - or at least a cyborg Clint Eastwood that he sees a lot of himself in - now's your chance to find out. I assume there's a posting interface built into the HUD when you load in as C4SH. Either that, or you'll have to run two monitors for the authentic experience of arguing with tweeters about the capabilities of their game-playing boxes as you play Borderlands. Remember: when it feels like you should probably stop posting, do not stop posting.</p>
<p>As they've revealed C4SH, Gearbox have also put out a DLC roadmap for Borderlands 4. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, the first story pack C4SH arrives as part of early next year, also includes extra main and side missions in a new zone of Kairos and new gear. Hopefully the majority of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">performance issues</a> which've plagued the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since release will be sorted by then, so you can enjoy C4SH rather than crash.</p>

            <p>May Horace save and protect you, my fellow Metamedia Sorcerers, for I come with bad tidings. We are entering a news-lull. While there are some curious, possibly even attention-worthy PC games out this week, none of them are Big. None of them have that triple, quadruple or possibly even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">quintuple-A bullshit frosting</a> the Maw so delights to batten upon. Last week gave us Tokyo Game Show, a time of relative bounty, but this week, there is a dearth of obvious headline material, and the Creature is already showing signs of discontent.</p>
<p>Its guts stiffen and strain like paralysed icebreakers. Its eyes widen in every mirror. How could it get worse? Oh hell's teeth, I've run out of coffee. We're doomed! Rohan has deserted us! Theoden has betrayed me! Abandon your posts! Flee, flee for your lives!
</p><!--more-->
<p>I don't have a Gandalf to stride in here, whack me with a staff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=267nNfzyL5E">rally the troops</a>. James would have played the part, I'm sure, but he's not in today. Perhaps he's out buying coffee. Please let that be the case. Also, please let somebody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buy EA or equivalent</a> so that we have a chunky morsel to appease the beast, before it ruptures the continuum and turns Mars into Belgium again. Casting my gaze wildly at the events calendar, I see only the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events?year=2025">GamesIndustry.biz HR Summit 2025</a> on 2nd October. I can't feed HR people to the Maw! After all, they're vitally needed for approving my holidays. Please, let somebody post a link to something straightforwardly huge in the comments. While you scrape around for ideas, here's the latest new game round-up.
</p>
<h2>Monday 29th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862550/Bonapartes_Bluff/">Boneparte's Bluff</a> is a free and simple-looking abstract strategy game in which the pieces lie to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 30th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is a revamp of the venerable PS1 strategy RPG. Dom over at Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">says it's pretty good</a>.</li>
<li>It seems likely you're in the mood for xenomorphs, after Alien: Earth, so maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>'s Evolved Edition (pictured), the new headset-free version of a VR horror game that is apparently a bit mid.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1969370/LEGO_Party/">LEGO Party!</a> is a four-player minigame bonanza with an unnecessary and frankly condescending exclamation mark. People should know well enough to supply their own dang exclamation marks when they play "party" games.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 1st October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">Flick Solitaire</a> is a solo card game with a lot of decks from different artists. It's free-to-play and launching in early access. There are in-app purchases and season passes, but "all core gameplay, collecting decks, and completing them can be experienced for free". A suspicious CTRL+F of the Steam page reveals no mention of NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 2nd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Éalú</a> is an atmospheric puzzler with hand-made, stop-motion animations. It's about a wooden mouse trying to escape a maze.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> is a monster-taming RPG about those collectible creatures who aren't Pokemon and also aren't currently being sued for trying to be Pokemon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 3rd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3386900/Castle_of_Heart_Retold/">Castle Of Heart: Retold</a> is a prettied-up version of a lush Slavic side-scroller in which a knight must continuously murder vodniks to stop his body turning to stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's your cue. Fill me in on any important breaking news, or major games releases not mentioned here. Please, I beg of you. I'm literally writing this from inside the Mawmouth, peering out at you through a forest of quantum strings as thick as baleen. It smells awful in here. I'm sitting on a rancid chunk of Borderlands DLC, attempting to wipe the kaiju dribble off my laptop screen. Time to test out this Boneparte Bluff game, I guess, while Mark embarks on an emergency expedition to locate any massive standalone mods we've forgotten about.</p>

<p>Also, one reason it hasn't arrived already is that the team have been working to ensure other quest add-ons won't force you to go back to square one, whenever they drop.</p>

<p>"This DLC is a DLC in name only really, it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content," Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter wrote on Team FOLON's<a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1233281020376252417/1421047996292005960">Discord server</a> over the weekend, in response to a user asking if they'd have to start over again when the DLC arrives. "So, it'll require a new save. One of the reasons it's also [taken] so long was ensuring any future groundwork for other quests in other DLCs won't require the new game save."</p>
<p>A fresh save being mandatory for at least the first of the three Fallout: London DLCs isn't a huge surprise. Since the mod first started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">updates and patches to fix bugs</a> last year, Team FOLON's advice for the best experience has been to start a new game each time a new version arrives, with carrying on from an established one being doable, but potentially leading you to run into "compatibility issues".</p><p>The possibility of messing with saves was what led the modders to roll Fallout: London's bug-fixing version 1.03 patch, originally teased late last year, into this upcoming first DLC. Given that, it's really encouraging to hear the modders have been working on ways to minimise the impact future updates'll have in this regard, since starting over in such a huge game every time it gets updated is far from ideal.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from this first DLC, Rabbit and Pork, Team FOLON's 2D art lead Emily ‘Saffron-rice’ Kemp wrote in a Discord exchange with another fan immediately following Carter's that DLC number one will include "various new side quests of different sizes, but no main quest content".</p>
<p>We do know that extra main questing will be coming in Fallout: London's third DLC, Wildcard, which looks to be the final one the modders have planned at the moment. As Carter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">revealed in an interview with me for my old home</a> last year, that DLC'll add in a whole New Vegas-style wild card arc for the game's main quest, which'll let you decide the fate of London without having to side with the three established main quest factions: Angel, Camelot, and the Fifth Column. This questline was originally intended to be in the base game, but had to be cut after the modder taking the lead on it was, in Carter's words, "basically forcibly conscripted" into the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>That leaves the second DLC, Last Orders, which very much looks pub-themed based on its name and the accompanying art. I'll be keen to give each of them a go, and all the better if I can get away without starting fresh three or four times in the process.</p>
