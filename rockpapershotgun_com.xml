            <p>When Sega and Creative Assembly's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> launched in 2014, I was deputy editor at Official Xbox Magazine. I remember getting the review copy from our contributor Alex "Game Over, Man" Dale, and asking him how long the game was. 35-40 hours, he said. WTF, I said. I can't remember how Alex responded - possibly his transmission ended with a jangling scream and a burp of static, or possibly he agreed with me that 35-40 hours is indecently hefty for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/I'd%20definitely%20shorten%20it">horror</a> game, even with the qualification that you can get through the main campaign in around 20. 35-40 hours? That's a farking Final Fantasy, mate!</p>
<p>Over 10 years later, we finally know who to blame. Surprise surprise, it was the xenomorph all along. According to Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay, the Gigerbeast's increasing capability during development made certain areas more time-intensive than they were originally supposed to be. There's probably a relevant Alien quote to invoke, here, but I'm going to settle for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0">that Jeff Goldblum line</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>Speaking to FRVR in <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/alien-isolation-writer-says-the-horror-game-is-too-long-because-its-clever-xenomorph-was-dumber/">a recent interview</a>, Lay conceded that "in a perfect world, yeah, I'd kind of shrink it down a bit, get down its core".

</p><p>"The Alien really evolved as we were making it," he went on. "By the time it was perfect, it was like, 'Oh, wow, everything takes a lot longer!' So, it would be really nice to pare it down to its core, make it a lot shorter. At the time, it didn't seem that long, and then you suddenly go, 'Oh my God.' So, yeah, I'd definitely shorten it, you know. But, yeah, at the time, there was some stuff where we were like: 'Yeah, we can't take that out now, that would kind of upend everything.'"</p><p>I'd like Lay to go into more detail about which particular aspects of Jack the Ripley-killer's behaviour had the biggest impact on completion times. The xenomorph's vaunted evolving AI was one of the game's major marketing McGuffins before release. I remember devs telling me campfire stories about how distractions such as flares might gradually lose effectiveness. The third time you lob a flare, the Alien may deduce the presence or even the likely position of a flare-thrower. Eek!</p>
<p>Back in 2014, I tried to map out all the AI permutations in a big double-page magazine flowchart for OXM, which probably got a lot of launch day players killed. I can't remember how this pre-release hype stacked up to the reality. Ten years is a long time, and my Isolation memories are mostly locker interiors, at this stage. Mostly.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's credible that the creature's smarts are one reason Isolation is such a marathon. Perhaps that's something Creative Assembly will address in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">the forthcoming Alien: Isolation sequel</a> - it's not clear how many of the old Isolation team are still there. In terms of persistent, unkillable munsters, I'd say the perfect organism's biggest competition right now is the Beast from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>.</p>

            <p>
"A Civ-like with neat ideas, but half-formed fundamentals and messy execution make your decisions feel less than impactful," wrote contributor Ian Boudreau in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/millenia-review">our Millennia review</a> from March 2024. Sounds like the kind of thing updates might fix, but alack, there shall be no more. Paradox have announced that the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">strategy</a> Civ-like's eighth patch, out now, will be its last.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"With this patch, we are sadly coming to the end of an age," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1268590/view/518599830010857584?l=english">a Steam blog post</a> from former Paradox Interactive community manager Katten. "This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely."
</p>
<p>
You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/millennia-update-8.1853194/">here</a>. I wouldn't say it's going out with a whimper, but this definitely isn't a bang. The update spans some general fixes for stuff like borked unit healing and visual errors, together with fixes for localisation. They've also added mod support for custom Age Paintings, and made modded Action Cards more consistent when loading save games.
</p>
<p>
I'm not a Millennia player, but I don't think there's anything on offer there that magically makes the game essential. The recent Steam user reviews are mostly disappointed faces, but Millennia does have a few defenders. 
</p>
<p>
In our review, Ian was both enticed and frustrated by the game's branching alternate-history format, which lets you unlock wacky epochs such as steampunk and aquatic ages by researching the right techs. This sits alongside more familiar 4X anachronisms, such as kingdoms making it all the way to the Renaissance without discovering horse-riding. I love the sound of it all, but as Ian explains, the system's drawback is that only one player can unlock the next age for all of other players, so if you pile research into a particular Age and somebody beats you to the punch, you're screwed. 
</p><p>
It should be a source of hectic competition, with sessions kept lively by the pressure to switch approaches when somebody rudely initiates the Age of Beehive Hairstyles or whatever, but in practice, it just seems to have annoyed a lot of people. Though possibly not as much as some more pervasive issues with the UI and graphics, or core systems such as diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Millennia launched before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> - also rather a divisive game, with age mechanics redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. Seems like doing age progression better has been on the minds of a lot of 4X designers lately. If you're looking for a new empire builder to sponge up the leisure hours/keep you from your annoying family, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">recently entered early access</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a>, which recently received one of those bombastic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untolds-big-revolutions-v20-update-is-out-now-aims-to-improve-nearly-every-area-of-the-game">2.0 updates</a>.

            <p>You there, fumbling around in the dark darkness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Deep of the Night</a>. A new mod offers you the chance to channel your inner gladiator and test your strength in a dedicated boss arena.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you've spent at least 80% of your time with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> thus far battering and being battered by bosses. But come on, you know you need to roll around more big blokes, with the chance to customise each bout of rolling exactly to your liking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A standalone game mode focused entirely on fighting bosses" is the promise of modder PositronCannon with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/449?tab=description">Nightreign boss arena</a>, which has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5645?tab=description">popular</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1854">siblings</a> for base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>. It adds a boss selection menu to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> featuring "almost every boss in the game, from Nightlords to minibosses".</p>
<p>Before hopping into a fight, a bunch of options let you tune both your character and aspects of the fight exactly how you fancy. Loadout-wise, there's "full access to the sparring grounds weapon selection menu, the ability to apply/remove passive buffs, set your character's level, set the amount of healing flasks, equip talismans, buy relics and other items for free", as well as cheats if you fancy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stats and characteristics of each boss can be tweaked, with the chance to specify if you want to take on a foe of a specific depth, a certain variant, or one of Deep of Night's mutated enemies. All ideal if the goal's getting in some lower-stakes practice for a certain expedition scenario or simply messing around with Nightreign's roster of would-be night-ruiners. The likes of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/141?tab=description">Free Reign</a> also let you warp straight to certain boss battles from Roundtable Hold, but to my eye PositronCannon's creation goes a lot more in-depth in terms of options to set up the exact fight you want.</p>
<p>The modder also has some ambitious expansion plans for it, in the form of an "Expedition Boss Rush" mode that'll see players "progress through a series of semi-random boss fights, obtaining items, buffs and runes as you go, culminating in a Nightlord fight." Sounds cool, if you're after a trip out in the evening that's a bit more heavy on slap-fests with serious supervisors.</p>
<p>All of that said, PositronCannon makes clear that their work's aimed solely at solo players, meaning it's not designed for seamless co-op enjoyers and likely won't work with that.
