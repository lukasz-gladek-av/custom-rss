A bit of creepy crawly, low-key city building? Ah, go on then. October and Halloween might be behind us, but Fangtopia is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game stroke city builder that still feels appropriate for late autumn. Having had a go with its demo, it's deceptively simple, in fact it felt so simple I wasn't entirely sure if I was doing anything at all. But when it clicked, all the pieces fell into place resulting in a pleasantly chill time.
</p>
<p>
The game is tile based, each tile having six sides, all of which are rotatable. These tiles come in different flavours, like forest tile, or a mountain tile, a wheat field tile, a village tile etc., you get it! And then some of these tiles mix and match those traits, hence why they're rotatable. You only have a certain amount of these tiles in what is essentially a deck of cards, though I hesitate to call it a deck builder, it's more just that each tile you're able to place is random from one move to the next. Placing certain amounts of tiles next to particular landmarks that crop up then add more tiles back into your deck, so you can keep building your little island.
</p>
<p>
Once you build up your little island, classic monsters like werewolves, yetis and the like crop up and they do their own thing. You know, monster stuff. One of my favourite aspects was that you could build your own little spectral trainline too. It was mostly for the aesthetics, though (I think) also helps you gather tile resources, but really I was just in it for watching the ghost train navigate its way along the path I set for it. 
</p>
<p>
It reminded me of Lego Loco, an old simulation game where you build up a town and train network for minifigures that my dad would leave me to play obsessively at his work to keep me distracted. There's something so delightful in building up a quiet corner of the world with not particularly high stakes, a quality I think comes through quite nicely in Fangtopia. Worth a punt, whenever it comes out! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010170/Fangtopia/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and try out its demo in the meantime.

            <p>
Here's a sentence I am very glad to write: the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>-like is here! Or at least the first one I'm aware of (and the actual genre is dice-driven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, no more something-likes, ok?). It's called Dusk Punk, which mixes the narrative and mechanical framework established by Citizen Sleeper with the aesthetics and world of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, and it's out today.
</p>
<p>
The setting of the game is a steampunk city called Dredgeport, a singular location more like the first Citizen Sleeper as opposed to the second. You must explore this city, coming face to face with gangs and corrupt law enforcement, as an ex-soldier, accidentally marked as dead and shipped back to the city. It is also an explicitly political game, a voice over in the game's trailer noting "unions rising up" and that "revolution is in the air."

<p>
Similarly to Citizen Sleeper, you have to balance your health, energy, and stress levels, a lot of which comes down to how lucky you get with the role of the dice. Such a mechanic is so obviously embedded in tabletop RPGs, and was so well translated into Citizen Sleeper. There is a strange feeling in having to pray for digital dice rolling in your favour, one I'm happy to see transplanted into a new world from a fresh perspective. Not to mention having to balance relationships with the game's various characters, some of whom may have questionable goals in mind.
</p><p>
I'm particularly won over by the final bit of voice over in the trailer: "break their laws, break the city, break free." Duskpunk is clearly not a game that features an easy or welcoming world, again much like Citizen Sleeper, but on the surface it seems like one that wants to push its audience to make a change. That's an even funnier thing to push someone to do when your ability to do so may be impeded by the luck of some dice. I suppose that's life! And that's interesting, so, Duskpunk has piqued my curiosity.
</p>
<p>
You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610880/Duskpunk/">pick it up on Steam now</a> with a 25% off launch discount, and there's a demo for you to take a look at too.
