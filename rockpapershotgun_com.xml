            <p>
Unfortunately, we are here yet again with another games studio that will seemingly be closing its doors for good. A couple of years ago, Greg Street, known for his work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, set up Fantastic Pixel Castle. There, it was announced at the time, he would lead development on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost">Ghost</a>, with NetEase serving as publisher. Except in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391147465636397057/">LinkedIn post</a> earlier today, Street shared that Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17," Street wrote. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains. While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there."
</p>
<p>
This latest closure, assuming that no one swoops in to save the day with presumably a few million dollars, is just the latest cut in a line of them from NetEase. The publishing giant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">kicked off the year</a> by laying off a number of US-based devs working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and in August they also shuttered T-Minus Zero Entertainment, a studio also founded two years ago by former BioWare developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> executive producer Rich Vogel, not to mention a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">number of other studios</a> facing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">cuts</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">closures</a>.
</p>
<p>
Not much was known about Ghost, and without a savior it might stay that way. It's not the only unreleased MMO to be cancelled within the last week either, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">Amazon recently did so with their Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. Fingers crossed for all the devs at Fantastic Pixel Castle.

            <p>
Friendslop games may come and go, but the (for all intents and purposes) progenitor of them all, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is still the one I think of most. It's scary, it's funny, it's otherworldly, literally, there's so much mystery to it that you just want to spend time in its world. But while it will likely go down as solo dev Zeekerss' most notable work, he did just release a brand new horror game 10 years in the making. And in a recent interview, he spoke of how he got his start in horror, and the roots that make up his latest work.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/i-dont-know-why-but-it-feels-like-fear-has-been-my-primary-emotion-ever-since-i-was-a-kid-lethal-company-creator-says-horror-games-still-feel-like-home-as-his-10-year-project-finally-ends/">GamesRadar</a>, Zeekerss noted that he "didn't start by making horror games, but I found my home in this genre. I don't know why, but it feels like fear has been my primary emotion ever since I was a kid. But it's a deeper thing; the emotional spectrum of fear and courage, hope and despair, is my way of interpreting the world. As an artist, it's my first language. I can branch out to other genres, but they'll always find their context in that."
</p>
<p>
You can really feel that even within Lethal Company. It's a horror game, sure, but through play it becomes a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, it's capable of a lot more than just scares. When it comes to his latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-the-dark-place">Welcome To The Dark Place</a>, Zeekerss speaks of a pretty broad influence too, citing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a> and its magical realism. "That game does this thing where it dives into dizzying, text-based 'rabbit holes' in which you tell yourself the story," he said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> from No Code (now Screen Burn, currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>) served as inspiration too, but the big one is the classic text-based adventure game Zork. "When I was a kid, maybe 10 years old, somebody loaded up Zork on the family computer and let me loose. I remember feeling like it was the most realistic and mysterious game I had ever played," Zeekerss explained.
</p><p>
I'm sure a burning question you might have is "how the hell did a text-based game take 10 years to make?" Well, the answer is good old fashioned scope creep. With text being infinitely easier to implement than 3D models or environments, as Zeekerss puts it, "As soon as I think of something, it can be playable." But because of that, it kind of got out of control, something he described as, at times, "maddening."
</p>
<p>
In the years since starting it, games like Lethal Company and his other works like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-steals">It Steals</a> and Dead Seater obviously got in the way too. But Zeekerss continues to be an interesting developer because of the fact he doesn't pin himself down to one type of game, even if horror is something he'll always come back to.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and, if you didn't know, Welcome To The Dark Place is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135700/Welcome_To_The_Dark_Place/">free on Steam</a>, so even if we're a few days past Halloween now, you've not got many excuses not to try it out.
