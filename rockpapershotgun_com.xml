As much as I'm up for trying a new one whenever one arrives, I'm not particularly good at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>. It just gets too sweaty for me, I prefer a good single-player shooter above all else because I can actually take down my opponents without the fear of embarrassing myself somehow. And yet here we are again, with the open beta for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, which started earlier today, leaving me thinking "well, I could give it a go I suppose."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I haven't actually had a go yet because, well, I'm a bit busy letting you all know that you can go and play it, and what it contains. Gotta earn a living somehow. Anyway, there's a lot! The biggest thing is The Lab, which is essentially its new map creator that was teased in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-is-almost-ready-for-you-try-it-out-as-the-portal-with-actual-guns-shooter-sets-a-date-for-its-open-beta">initial open beta trailer</a>. This pretty much does what it says on the tin, i.e. you can build your own maps and game modes. Pretty great fit for a game that combines Halo and Portal!

<p>
Then there's the return of Takedown, a team-based mode where if you kill an opponent your team's respawns are shorter, but if you get killed your respawns take longer. If you manage to down every enemy at the same time, you win! Stadium 2.0, a rework of the map from the original game, arrives with the beta too. There's also new 24-player onslaught maps, for those that like a bit more chaos. 
</p>
<p>
Hunt the Devs will also be returning from the open alpha, which isn't a mode so much as an achievement to set out. If you find a 1047 dev wearing a special flaming disco ball skin, you'll get a Dev Killer skin for the faction they're playing in return.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> say that "one more massive surprise" is yet to be shown off, planned to be revealed whenever the game enters 1.0. There's no date set for that just yet, but player progression will continue on to the full game, so don't feel like you have to wait around for it. To sign-up to the beta, all you need to do is head to the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/">game's official website</a>, and pick your platform of choice. Easy peasy!

            <p>
The Warhammer Skulls Showcase was full to the brim with, unsurprisingly, lots of Warhammer 40,000 game news, including a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">sequel to Boltgun</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">definitive edition of Dawn of War</a>. CRPG heads were also treated to a reveal of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a new party-based title from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/owlcatgames">Owlcat Games</a>, the devs behind another Warhammer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. The reveal came in the form of a nicely partially 2D-animated trailer alongside some brief looks at gameplay, all of which is looking quite good.

<p>
Much like Rogue Trader, Dark Heresy will feature turn-based combat, with this game "set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star." You'll have "intricate investigations" to complete outside of combat, with both those and combat potentially leading to some "grave consequences." Specifically, you'll be an acolyte of the Inquisition, and it'll be up to you to search out for heresy and ultimately decide what happens to the Calixis Sector.

As of now, a release date hasn't been set in stone, not even a release year, so you'll have to hold out for now. I imagine it'll be a while away too, as Owlcat Games are actually still working on Rogue Trader right now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> next expansion, Lex Imperialis, also received a release date reveal of June 24th during the presentation. A second season pass was announced too, revealing two more expansions due out between January and March, and July and September respectively next year.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">base game is half-off right now too</a>, if you fancy giving it a punt. Our very own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">reviewed it last year</a>, coming away from it with lots of nice things to say about, as well as a few not so nice things that probably would have been easier to deal with in smaller doses.
