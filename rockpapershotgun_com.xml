            <p>Have you showered yet today? No? Then maybe treat yourself to a bath if you can. It might help prepare for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Capcom formally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">confirmed last night</a> that, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">leaked</a>, it contains Leon Kennedy. Some of their devs have now offered a bit more detail as to how it'll feel to play as both him and co-lead Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa revealed that the time number of sections you'll spend playing as one of the two protagonists are "almost equally split", likening the structure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it feels to jump back and forth between them, there's a dichotomy of more traditional horror/fighty bloke action going on. "I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror," Nakanishi explained. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna."</p><p>Taking that metaphor forwards, I assume the monstery things the pair are up against are the dirt and dust we all accrue when we're out and about not playing a horror game. If any other familiar Resi faces show up, will they be filling the role of those little bits of cucumber which get put on the eyes of every person who's every been in an advert for places that boast baths and saunas?</p>
<p>Despite all the relaxing language, Nakanishi made clear that the actiony bits won't be a walk in the park. "The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before", the director said, later adding that the team have build on Kennedy's Resi 4 moveset to mirror how his skills and mindset have evolved since his last appearance. Altogether, Nakanishi reckons the juxtaposition of spooks and shoots will help Requiem deliver "a kind of exhilaration and satisfaction that past Resident Evil titles didn’t offer". </p>
<p>We'll see if that's the case when the Resi spa opens up on February 27th, 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> studio id Software are now home to a "wall-to-wall" union according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA's press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of "developers, artists, programmers, and more" - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. "Remote work isn’t a perk," he said. "It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being."</p><p>The CWA release also cited "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass industry layoffs</a>, sudden periods of crunch time, and unfair pay" as part of the impetus behind a wider push towards unionisation among devs across the industry this year, adding that the total of unionised workers across Microsoft's fiefdom is now "nearly 4,000" strong.</p>
<p>CWA president Ron Swaggerty added that the union "look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication these workers bring to every project."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, members of the "industry-wide union" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">the CWA announced</a> earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1999257505751532008">held a protest</a> outside of The Game Awards yesterday, with their aim being to "to acknowledge the video games and studios that have been closed and to also condemn the creativity that’s been crushed by corporate greed and studio executives".
</p>
<p>Solidarity to these id Software workers.</p>
