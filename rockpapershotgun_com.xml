You know what South Park feels like to me? It feels like randomly waking up in the middle of the night, looking around your bedroom as you think "cripes, it's still not morning yet?" A feeling of waiting for the inevitable, the end, or the beginning. Not so much the contents of the show, none of that needs all that much thought, more so its very existence, which is now apparently transplanting itself into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
This latest collab came with, much like collabs with The Simpsons, Family Guy etc., a trailer that kicks off with an animation set within the world of the show. Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny are all playing Fortnite together, Butters left out as he always as the pre-pubescent worst boys in the world chat all sorts of gamer nonsense. The ostracisation of Butter leads him to find the stick of truth - yes, like the one from the South Park game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">The Stick of Truth</a>, admittedly quite cute - warping them all into Fortnite itself.

<p>
As is standard for the Forted Nite these days, because all of the skins you can get - which includes all four main boys and Butters - are all actual children, so they've got makeshift robotish bodies to prance around in. On top of that, there's a whole new bit of the map to explore, Cartmanland, a theme park which harbours the aforementioned stick of truth which can do… something, you'll figure it out when you play.
</p><p>
There's also a new Quints 5-person playlist, convenient for those of you that have a Butters in your life (if you're the kind of person that has a Butters in their life, be kind to them). This all drops later this week on Friday, January 9th, and it'll be live until February 5th. Happy South Parking!

            <p>
If there were ever a dead horse that didn't need so much flogging, it might be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series. Undeniably beloved by many, it has fallen victim to that whole franchising thing, having received an entry only in 2024 via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, a sequel game that was perhaps a little bit too messy. And here we are, in 2026, with PEGI potentially spoiling the reveal of a new entry in the series subtitled Reunion. Spoilers ahead for the game!
</p>
<p>
You can see as such on the official PEGI ratings board website by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-be-still-my-irritated-heart">simply searching for Life is Strange</a>, with Reunion popping up right at the top. There is even an entire outline of the game, revealing that this one brings about the return of none other than Chloe Price, who was absent from the most recent entry.
</p>
<p>
"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret," reads the game's synopsis. "Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."
</p>
<p>
Welp! This sure sounds like a game the Life is Strange fandom will feel incredibly normal about. There are also some more PEGI-oriented references to parts of the game, like there being a scene where the player (presumably Chloe) has her drink spiked at a party, alongside some apparent depictions of "strong, realistic violence," with numerous references to suicide. Sounds heavy, but par for the course with this series.
</p>
<p>
This just being a PEGI rating, there's zero word on when a proper reveal might come, so you'll have to wait to see what this one ends up looking like.
