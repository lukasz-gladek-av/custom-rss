A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update is here, version 1.0.5, with this one mostly having a focus on parkour improvements. There are, however, a couple of collaborations that have arrived in the game too, one with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and another with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. We'll get to those in a second, for now let's take a look at those parkour tweaks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, you can jump now! Well, you can do a vertical jump to be specific, letting both Naoe and Yusuke hop in an upwards direction to grab ledges or overhangs within reach. There's also now a sprint toggle lock option, meaning as long as you're moving, you won't stop sprinting if you use the parkour up or down options.

<p>
Some enhanced back and side ejects have been added in too, specifically the distance and height of them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> noting that foot landings will be favoured over hand landings. Naoe specifically will have some new animations when she does a height-gaining side eject.
</p>
<p>
You'll find a good few new photo mode features alongside all of this, with things like the ability to change the time of day, playing music while you're tweaking your shots, the ability to save custom filters, and for PC specifically, a fullscreen option.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those collabs. The first is a Dead by Daylight event, which Ubisoft describes as follows: "As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threatâ€¦" You can start this new quest from your hideout once you've unlocked Yasuke, and once you've beaten it you'll get a trinket and banner.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the Balatro collab. That damn card game really has it's hooks in all of us, 'ey? This one is just a new trinket for Naoe and amulet for Yasuke called Winning Hand. These both offer a legendary perk that "gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders." How do you get these new items? "You will need to work together to figure out how to get it!" says Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
There's a bunch of other general fixes with this update to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game too, but you can read about all of those over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a>.
