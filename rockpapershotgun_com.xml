            <p>Ah, no, not that one. That, I assume, has been the reaction of folks who've gone to pre-order the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon-2025">Marathon</a> reboot on Steam, and immediately been informed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> is sneaking its way back onto their machines. Thankfully, Bungie have now fixed whatever issue was causing the latter to take pre-purchases of the former as a cue to re-install itself.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">arrival on March 5th</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s been trying to do its mate and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">higher-ups at Sony</a> a solid by persuading folks they might as well fire up the MMO.</p>
<p>Hence the following post from Bungie early this morning: "We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam.

<p>Given PC Destiny 2's file size can balloon up to around 170 GB, that's certainly a relief. I'd liken it to suddenly having a piano dropped on your hard drive, but I reckon Destiny 2 would want to be classed as some sort of weird futuristic instrument with a name like 'The Keypresser'. As opposed to Marathon, which would almost certainly insist that whatever the instrument's name was, it must be painted lime green and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nobodys-reinventing-the-wheel-with-marathons-mechanics-says-former-art-boss-so-the-visual-design-needed-to-take-risks">vaguely remind you of plastic IKEA furniture</a>.</p><p>Then again, the Destiny 2 side of the fence has had its own Marathon pre-order problem. Bungie have also <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/2013356027261935971">fixed an issue</a> which was leading Marathon-themed gear for the MMO, which is included as part of a Marathon pre-order, from showing up for collection at Destiny 2's special deliveries kiosk. So, people who wanted Marathon got an extra Destiny 2, and people who wanted Destiny 2 with a bit of Marathon in it just got Destiny 2.</p>
<p>If only I was as good at self-promo as the shooter about running around with a wee robot eye. I'd probably be ruling the galaxy by now.</p>
