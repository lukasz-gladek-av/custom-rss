            <p>
Right at the end of last year, Cyberpunk and Witcher developer CD Projekt Red sold off its game distribution company to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński (who is also the co-founder of CD Projekt itself, so, go figure). With this sort of new owner, the plan is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">generally to stick to what it knows best</a>, i.e. sprucing up old games and making sure any game on the platform is DRM-free. But in a new interview, Kiciński also shared his interest in the platform doing some publishing.
</p>
<p>
Kiciński shared as such with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">Eurogamer</a>, explaining that he is also "co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe. So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss." One thing he did stress is that a formal decision on such a thing hasn't been made yet, but "this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that such a future is far off, as Kiciński only technically officially started his role as sole head of the company on January 8th, noting that the current priority is that GOG improves on what it currently does. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that," he said. "GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much."
</p>
<p>
I am not personally sure that this feels like a good way forward. I can envision a world where a game GOG publishes gets priority treatment on the homepage over one that doesn't and that is an icky future if you ask me. Luckily, as Kiciński says, no decisions have been made, so hopefully a lot of thought gets put into this first.

            <p>
It is not news to anyone that Nightdive Studios' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake took a while to make. The remake started development in 2015, with a successful Kickstarter project held for it the following year. After a few engine changes and attempts at making the thing, it finally released back in 2023, a good eight years after development had started. But such a long wait is absolutely not worth calling the FBI over, folks, are we being serious right now? Which is, apparently, a thing that happened to Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/system-shock-remake-lead-couldnt-sleep-due-to-the-mass-vitriol-from-fans-reported-to-the-irs-fb/">FRVR</a>, game director Stephen Kick spoke of the stress that came from working on the project and the large swathe of vitriolic comments targeted directly at him. "That was a really rough point in my life," Kick explained. "I took a lot of that very personally because we had built up a considerable amount of just community respect and admiration, so much so that many people were willing to risk a not-insignificant amount of money on a project that I knew we were capable of doing."
</p>
<p>
It wasn't just some comments left on the game's Kickstarter page or across the studio's social pages. Kick notes that he "was threatened with lawsuits, any matter of things you could do to somebody." He explained further, "We got reported to the IRS and the FBI. It was awful. There was probably a good month and a half where I could not sleep at night because of the weight of everything that had some down on the company."
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm really not sure a video game you're excited about is worth calling the FBI over. Right? Am I the one who's lost their marbles here? In any case, even if it took a while, the System Shock remake did come out, and RPS contributor Jeremy Peel even gave it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">coveted RPS Bestest Bests award</a>. So, it seems like the wait was probably worth it!

            <p>If you've ever wanted to spend somewhere in the region of $67/£50 to turn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> into a fishing simulator, today's your lucky day. <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">Rockstar-partnered GTA roleplaying server operators</a> Cfx.re - the folks behind FiveM and RedM - have launched the Cfx Marketplace, a store where you can buy a bunch of GTA roleplaying mods, some of which are free and some of which seem pretty damn expensive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to its <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289">announcement post</a>, the Cfx Marketplace is designed to server as "a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work. Featuring purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more, there’s something for every server and every player." So, something along the lines of Bethesda's various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creation-club-is-bethesdas-alternative-to-paid-mods">Creations/Bethesda.net initiatives</a>, where modders' works are hosted somewhere that has the official seal of approval, rather than third-party modding sites.</p>
<p>Let's see what you can grab to trick out your GTA 5 experience he...wait. It'll cost me how much to turn GTA into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a>? $67.19, which is just under £50, for modder Lixeiro Charmoso's <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222299-trucker-simulator">Trucker Simulator</a>. To be fair, it's clearly a detailed truck simming experience and getting such things running on a GTA roleplaying server probably isn't easy, but as someone who's not familiar with GTA roleplaying mod prices, woof. For context, the base version of ETS2 will set you back £16.89 assuming you don't buy it in a sale. It's currently in such a sale, lowering the price to £4.22/$4.99. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, meanwhile, is exactly the same price sans DLC.</p>
<p>A GTA roleplaying mod which turns the game <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222309-fishing-simulator">into a fishing simulator</a> will set you back the same price as the truck sim mod, while a <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7219969-drugs-bundle">bundle</a> by another modder which allows you to manufacture meth, cocaine and weed runs to $131.99/around £98 altogether. That said, there are some less expensive or free mods on the store too, such as one that gives <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6715119-lc-fuel">every car realistic fuel consumption</a>, so you have to stop to fill up regularly.</p><p>On the one hand, you'd hope that buying these from a Rockstar-affiliated store would at least guarantee you getting the bang for your buck you're promised, something a payment made to a third-party site or random person in a Discord server doesn't necessarily provide absolute security of. On the other, those prices aren't cheap, and it's rather ironic to see Rockstar/Take-Two's relative about-face after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">warring</a> with various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">GTA</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">modders</a> end up in something like this.</p>
<p>That's not to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">the other elephant in the room</a> at the moment when it comes to whether you might be open to spending cash on a service backed by the company behind GTA 6, even if it's not clear how much of a cut - if any - said company get from Cfx Marketplace purchases.</p>
