            <p>If your time with foundational PC strategy 4X game series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> consists of exactly one save file that ended somewhere in the Middle Ages, don't beat yourself up, for you have plenty of company. When they got hold of detailed audience data for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>'s new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.</p><!--more-->
<p>That 40% figure comes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/arts/civilization-7-design-firaxis.html">an interview with the New York Times</a>, which pairs Firaxis insight with thoughts from academics and third party designers about Civilization's pretty well-rehearsed colonialist leanings. While the data refers to Civ 6 specifically, I'm pretty confident you can apply these findings to Civilization games in general. There's <a href="https://kotaku.com/nine-out-of-10-will-not-finish-the-game-they-are-playin-5832450">ample</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/17/gdc-most-players-donat-finish-games">evidence</a> to the effect that most video game players leave games unfinished, and 4X games in particular are arguably most fun at the outset while the world is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Among the NYT's interviewees is Indian game developer Nikhil Murthy, whose current project Syphilisation is both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation-is-a-ferociously-in-depth-empathic-reworking-of-civilization-and-other-4x-games">a post-colonial critique of Civilization and an investigation of Civ play possibilities</a> buried by the mantra of Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Murthy comments that Civilization's endgame-focussed "winner takes all" mindset has a flattening effect on all the fun you can have with its systems. New School professor McKenzie Wark elaborates upon Murthy's argument with the thought that the most intriguing Civ players are the "trifling" ones who don't really care about victory. "You're just interested in exploring the rule set," she told the paper. "So your civilization inevitably gets defeated, but you find little affordances as you go along."</p>
<p>The NYT piece is too brief to go into much detail here, sadly, but it reminds me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">my own roundtable chat</a> about 4X design with Murthy, Paradox Interactive's Ryan Sumo and Civilization lead designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jon-shafer">Jon Shafer</a> from 2023. At one point in that conversation, Shafer recalls that during his time at Firaxis, designers frequently heard that players enjoy "that first X-and-a-half, the exploration part and the initial expansion part, before you're really in competition".</p>
<p>Civ7 creative director Ed Beach also alludes to this in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/ages/">a developer diary about the Age system</a>. "From our perspective, not finishing the game is a signal that players are hitting points where they're no longer having fun," he writes. "We want everyone to have a great experience from start to finish. We know that players often feel the beginning hours of Civ are magical, and we want to make sure that every part of the game feels just as epic and exciting as that initial rush."</p>
<p>I can't tell you whether Firaxis have succeeded in this with Civilization 7. Our review remains forthcoming. But I am certainly among the players who favour the early game and prefer tinkering about as a mid-rank Civ to assuming a position of monotonous economic, cultural or military dominance. How about you, reader dear?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will get "additional playable characters and bosses" via DLC, according to an entry on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>. This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> trilogy, Sekiro and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Steam page mention of DLC has since been removed, but not fast enough to evade the watchful harpies of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">Parsimonious Gamer</a>. The now-deleted entry didn't specify which characters or bosses, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that there will be some familiar faces. We already know that Nightreign features a few bosses from previous From Software games, including the first Dark Souls' Centipede Demon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s dragon-riding solar warrior the Nameless King.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/">Gamespot</a>, From Software game director Junya Ishizaki has explained the return of Nameless King and other stalwarts as reflecting the need for variety in a battle royale-flavoured bossrush experience that thrives on creative match-ups. "We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles," he told the site, going on to note that "our players have a lot of affection for these characters" and that From are being careful to ground things in lore and ensure the bosses "make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign".
</p>
<p>
I don't doubt Ishizaki's sincerity when he adds that "from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun", and I don't want to get too picky with the wording of an answer that presumably came via translator, but "leverage" is a word you tend to hear from publishers looking to squeeze more cash out of their established fictional worlds. If Nightreign finds an audience, I expect there will be plenty more leveraging. In this regard, From are of course following in the footsteps of modders, who've been porting bosses between games for yonks and even making them fight each other Salty Bet-style.
</p>
<p>
There are definitely some old From characters I'd love to see in Nightreign. It's interesting to consider how they might be adapted to the game's quickfire open world multiplayer format. Bloodborne's sorrowful cosmic being Ebrietas, for example, although that's partly because I didn't have the heart to attack her in the original game. Sekiro's many Headless varmints.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, though, I'm less interested in which characters might return than in how From Software might justify their presence at the level of environmental storytelling and backstory. While it's an angle I've overegged in the past, From's tales of overthrowing corrupted kings and being corrupted in the process can easily be read as a mythologisation of the pitfalls of prolonging a narrative franchise, stretching out stories till they become boneless and dissatisfying, and reviving characters who should have died or retired several iterations ago. 
</p>
<p>
In Dark Souls 3, for example, there is a cannibalistic monster who fights using the half-eaten husk of a character from the original game. It's interesting to place that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-is-2016s-best-boss">act of regurgitation</a> against what we know of Nightreign's update plans, which seem heavily informed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">the undead philosophies of live service games</a>. I wonder if the new game will end up being one big metaphor for seasonal update entropy?
