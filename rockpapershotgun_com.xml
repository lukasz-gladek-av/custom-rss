            <p>
I feel like money laundering is one of those concepts you see in a lot of crime TV shows but it's not really something that seems to come up much in games. I certainly can't think of any games that feature money laundering as an actual mechanic, but I'll be able to add one to the list next week: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game is getting a new update this coming June 17th called <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/513kao973a73ko/gta-online-money-fronts-coming-june-17">Money Fronts</a>, and is literally all about buying up small but generally lucrative businesses that you can sneak some money through.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a few businesses you'll be able to pick up but you'll be starting off with a classic: the car wash, specifically Hands On Car Wash. You'll get passive income through this from your criminal network, eventually allowing you to pick up the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, all of which will also bring in their own money from actual, legal business operations.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pro of lots of moola, there is a big con too. Operating these businesses this way will generate heat, and if that gets too high, you'll have to actually step in as the local business owner you're pretending to be to manage these companies the way they're legally meant to be.
</p>
<p>
There's a few new rides you can pick up too, like the Karin Everon RS or the Declasse Tampa GT (Muscle). Money Fronts is also bringing in some gameplay tweaks. More than 50 vehicles will have missile lock-on jammer capability, and all sources of arena points are being doubled. A number of cutscenes will be skippable on mission replays too, though which ones that'll be weren't specified.
</p>
<p>
More details will be coming, uh, at some point, Rockstar just said "stay tuned". You only have to wait a few days for it anyway, you'll live.

I'm not much of an MMO person, I've dabbled over the years like with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> in my youth, and a bit of Final Fantasy 14. These days it's the level of commitment that puts me off, even though I really do love being able to partake in what feels like living, breathing worlds, the hustle and bustle of actual people going to and fro. Luckily, I think I have a lower-key way to get this kind of feeling in the upcoming action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> Starlight Re:Volver.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right from the first second of Starlight Re:Volver you'll absolutely be thinking to yourself "oh, this is anime as hell." That'll be offputting to some, maybe, but it does so with such a ridiculous degree of finesse and style, I was won over right out the gate. The core gameplay loop is that you set out on runs with up to three of your friends, going through different rooms with waves of enemies across them, picking up abilities and buffs along the way.

It definitely seems like there's a Hades-like approach to the game, though the demo that's currently available for Steam Next Fest is more like an online playtest above all else. Right now I'd say there's a bit of an onboarding issue, as the game doesn't really do much to tell you much about anything, but with multiple characters to choose from all with unique playstyles, I had a fun enough time in the few runs I went through.
</p>
<p>
All of that can be smoothed over of course, I'm not that worried about that, so the real thing that's pulling me in so far is the vibes. The game's Steam page refers to itself as an "anime-inspired MMO universe", and the game's hub area certainly offers a slice of such a pie up.
</p>
<p>
There's an in-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a> rip-off to play, a fishing mini-game, clothes to unlock, different areas to just hang out in. You can see different players running around too, and even if there's not much to do right now, it really does capture that specific feeling of being in a virtual place with a whole bunch of strangers.
</p>
<p>
How that may progress whenever the game comes out, I can't tell you, it's certainly something I hope to see expanded upon. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201010/Starlight_ReVolver/">here</a>, and you have until June 16th to try out the demo for yourself.

            <p>
It's a crossover episode! Like the great team-ups of the past (Scooby-Doo and Batman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/totally-accurate-battle-simulator">Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/landfall-games">Landfall</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/aggro-crab">Aggro Crab</a> have come to make Peak. As in it's literally called Peak, not a qualitative descriptor that's been more widely adopted into Gen-Z slang that you have to Google because you're not a spring chicken anymore.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Peak is an aptly named game too, as it's all about climbing mountains. This being a game made by both Landfall and Aggro Crab, this obviously comes with a certain amount of silliness. Your virtual avatar is one that I can only describe as a "little guy", who you can apparently customise with different outfits and accessories. It's also playable in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, in fact that kind of seems to be the main selling point, but you can go solo too.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>our new game PEAK is a climbing game with friends where the slightest mistake can spell your doom🗻</p><p>reach the top of the mountain as a group of scouts when it drops JUNE 16‼️ <a href="https://t.co/5EADzD6gWd">pic.twitter.com/5EADzD6gWd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1933541312315236620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>
The whole goal is to get to the top of the mountain (otherwise known as the peak of the mountain, if I need to spell it out for you), in hopes of being rescued after having crash landed on a mysterious island. There's four biomes to wade through, and along the way you'll have to pick up food to keep yourself going. You can get injured too, so unlike the example provided in the trailer above, you probably shouldn't punt your med kit off the side of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, a majority of the game was made within a one month game jam, so you shouldn't necessarily expect infinite content or whatever it is shareholders want these days. It just looks like a silly, goofy way to hang out with some friends for a few hours. It's also out really soon! June 16th to be precise, so you've only got a couple of days to wait. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">here</a>.
