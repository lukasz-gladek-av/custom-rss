            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> won't receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a>, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual "reinvention". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Veilguard's neater ending is partly owing to BioWare's desire to avoid a repeat of the situation with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, the previous game from 2014, which paved the way for Veilguard's premise with its DLC. Speaking to Eurogamer in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">a lengthy postmortem chat</a> after Veilguard's release, Epler commented that continuing that game's knotty storyline while introducing newcomers to the series was a real headache - though perhaps not as big a headache as <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">the initial struggle to make a multiplayer game</a>, in line with publisher EA's live service ambitions at the time.
</p>
<p>
"Inquisition did end with some fairly hefty dangling plot threads," he explained. "Obviously there's the post-credits scene with Solas and Flemeth, and it felt at the time - because I was on Inquisition, I was on the Trespasser team - we looked at what we already had and decided, okay, we want to do one last chapter, one last story beat. The difference in The Veilguard is the story ends pretty conclusively. There is, obviously, a secret post-credits scene, but that's less of 'here is an immediate thing that you now need to be aware of', and more 'here's a hint as to what the future will be'."
</p>
<p>
"We wanted to make sure that this one ended in a less ambiguous way, where it's very clear that this story is done," he went on. "What comes next, you will see, but it won't require the same level of 'okay let's catch you up on what's happened'. I'm still proud of the team and what they did at the beginning of this one, but there's a lot that comes from previous games that feed into this one."
</p><p>
Busche dropped a few more concrete tips about possible Dragon Age 5 plots. "Isn't it interesting how a lot of the threats that have been prevalent throughout the franchise only scratch at the surface of the mysteries and possibilities in the IP?" she said. "There's been a lot of exploration of the Blight, the elven gods, the elven people, and it's wonderful subject matter. However, it also makes me curious about the other aspects that are less explored and equally as interesting: the nature of the qunari, what's across the seas, what's happening with the titans, the development of the dwarven people. 
</p>
<p>
"So in many ways, I feel like answering some of these long-threaded mysteries that are specific to the Blight and specific to the elves, this gives some space to explore other ideas in the future," she concluded, inconclusively.
</p>
<p>
Veilguard is more of an action game than an RPG, much to the disappointment of Inquisition diehards and crustier BioWare followers at large. Epler and Busche discuss this in the Eurogamer interview, with Busche coyly observing that Dragon Age is "a franchise of reinvention", and that the next sequel might switch genres once again. 
</p>
<p>
"In some ways there are some parallels in that regard, to say, the Final Fantasy series," she said. "Of course, very different in terms of choice and consequences, and so many other factors, but there are those RPG franchises that embrace that reinvention, that when a new one gets announced, it really piques your curiosity about where are we going to go? What kind of adventure is this going to be?"
</p><p>
I'm still making my way through Veilguard. I'm enjoying the combat and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-deeply-enamoured-by-dragon-age-the-veilguards-intricate-and-ridiculous-fashion-design">costumes</a>, but I do yet yearn for Inquisition's (horribly unwieldy) tactical planning and its gratuitous base management. So colour me hopeful that Veilguard's successor is more of a role-player. Still, why restrict ourselves to the spectrum between action game and RPG? I wouldn't mind playing an immersive sim set in Thedas, or perhaps a dating game.

Astrometica is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> in space and to developer BeryMery's credit, the game makes zero effort to hide this. It's right there in the dog Latin of the title. It's got Subnautica's premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry. It's got Subnautica's core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.  
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's got its own close variations on Subnautica's fonts, Subnautica's tubular habitats and building interface, Subnautica's curvy, slightly luminous gadgetry, Subnautica's softly contoured menus, even a fair approximation of Subnautica's lilting, characterless music. Based on a quick 20 minutes with the Steam demo, being set the other side of an atmosphere is the <em>only</em> thing that differentiates Astrometica from the Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> sim - OK, that and perhaps the gentlest drizzling of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> in the ability to melt the locks off cargo pods in zero gravity. What absolutely brazen cheek! This is probably going to make a trillion dollars. Here's a trailer.

"Subnautica but in space" might lure the magpie gaze of the internet's survival simmers, but it threatens to be a step back from the richness of Subnautica. After all, a huge part of the latter's charm is that the world is alive, changing dramatically as you go deeper and push out from the sunny coral reef at the heart. Outer space lacks that sense of structure and vitality. Not many fish out here. So it's just as well that Astrometica appears to take place predominantly in an asteroid field littered with domed habitats where other beings might dwell, to say nothing of abandoned ships and "cosmic anomalies". 
</p><p>
There appear to be a few active threats - jovial tentacle boys that lunge at your visor, for example - together with outcrops of astral flora that look like the offspring of a lava lamp and a swingball. Still, it all feels very empty right outside your escape pod. I genuinely found myself glancing around for those gumball-tailed seals who are among the first larger creatures you meet in Subnautica. I realise that in space, nobody can hear you scream, but I do miss their hooting.
</p>
<p>
Technically, of course, Subnautica is already Subnautica in space. Your character was an astronaut right up till they crashlanded on some weird planet full of germs and leviathans. It's almost as though each game's lead characters were originally crewmates aboard the same doomed starship. When the shit hit the fan, Astrometica's protagonist happened to board an escape pod pointing in the opposite direction. I find that notion funny. I'm not sure Unknown Worlds are laughing. Astrometica is out in early access this month. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2353250/Astrometica/">Read more on Steam</a>.
