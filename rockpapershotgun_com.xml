            <p>"Bestest best?! We’ll have that!" is how I imagine detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">immersive sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-of-doubt">Shadows Of Doubt</a> made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. "RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">here</a>, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.</p>
<p>19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab’s Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a>.</p>

<p>The bundle itself is joining a bunch of other streaming events over December in raising money for eight charities. That’s War Child, CALM, Autistica, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Bristol Children’s Hospital, and Whale And Dolphin Conservation. You can find the details of each, including the stream times <a href="https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/">here</a>. If there’s a specific charity from the list you’re especially interested in supporting, different streams each have specific causes they’re fundraising for.</p><p>Of the games, I’m quite fond of both Two Point Campus and Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers. I suspect my actual favourite will turn out to be Citizen Sleeper - I’ve just been holding off on playing it for the right time. I like to meticulously block-in calender dates on which I expect to experience strong emotions, lest they interfere with my usual schedule of detached ennui.</p>
<p>My autocorrect won’t let me write ‘Brendy’ today without changing it to ‘Brandy’. Is this you trying to be Christmassy, Google docs? Please do not try and enforce your regime of cheer on me, it’s horrible. Anyway - Brendan’s favourite from the list would, I imagine, be Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-review">to which he awarded </a>a coveted and delicious RPS Bestest Best. “Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant,” wrote he. "I think the immersive detective sim has found its first true killer". Come for the thoughtful breakdown, stay for a detective named Dick McClumps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> arrives soon, which will be exciting to many of you who like the guy who runs from large boulders and occasionally cracks a whip. It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you've had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy's hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you'll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you'll need something even juicier.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've popped an image of the PC requirements below. Running the game at minimum specs (without ray tracing) isn't <em>too</em> costly to be fair. I'm no hardware editor, but I do think my own several-years-old PC could churn it out fairly comfortably, even if my slow broadband speeds would take about a year to download the hefty 120GB needed before I could even get started. If you're after ray tracing at minimum, you'll need a RTX 4070 12GB. One thing I do know - that 4070 ain't cheap, chief.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>As for those recommended specs (again, without ray tracing), you're looking at a pretty pricey system, firmly planted within that midrange tier. The work-supplied PC I'm writing this article on can run most games smoothly at 1080p, but if I wanted to get into Indy on the recc specs, I'd need to double my RAM. If I wanted to even tickle Ultra settings? Hah. No.</p>

<p>Our Edwin had a go of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones">Indiana Jones</a> And The Meatball Marinara a little while ago and found it to be "handsome and glossy enough" in presentation, but with a world that felt like "the usual triple-A compromise of impossible sheen at the price of a certain liveliness". Not to mention Indy's insatiable desire to get his grubby hands on everything.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>Games as a service "remains a pillar of our strategy"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft have discontinued their PvP shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and laid off roughly 277 employees at the studios who worked on the multiplayer game. "[We’ve] not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market," said Ubisoft executive Marie-Sophie de Waubert in a statement to workers that was later posted <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">on Ubisoft's website</a>. Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are "transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The multiplayer servers will stay up until June, said de Waubert, and the latest season will still be added to the game. But you won't be able to download the game and register to play, nor buy anything in-game if you currently have the shooter installed. Anything players have bought in the last 30 days will also be refunded. </p>
<p>"[This] decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney," says de Waubert in the post, using the soft verb "departing" to refer to her company's axing of roles, as if these people are simply stepping on a plane of their own volition. I'll add it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">the list</a>.</p>
<p>Despite increasingly clear signs that the games-as-a-service business model is risky (and for some of us <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">deeply tiring</a>), the Ubichief claims the company's focus on that won't change. She cites past support for games that struggled before becoming sustainable, such as tactical shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and 3v3 ahistorical brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>.</p>
<p>"Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy," says de Waubert. "It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles."</p>

<p>None of that will be much comfort to the people who are out of work, I imagine. Although it is possible this is not a surprise either. Back in September <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">a report by Insider Gaming</a> claimed management was unhappy with the game and already considering putting a bullet in it. In response to these rumours, executive producer Mark Rubin insisted XDefiant was "not dying" in an official blog post. </p><p>"No, the game is absolutely not dying," said Rubin just months ago. "We know there are things we need to improve... but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan. Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that.”</p>
<p>That has not proven to be the case. Ubisoft's support of the game - and its workers - lasted just over six months. Rubin's rebuttal of those early reports of discontent has since been scrubbed from Ubisoft's website, replaced with yesterday's closure news. But you can get the gist from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-call-of-duty-fps-ubisoft-dying-rubin-road-map-1851651645">this Kotaku report</a> or see the update using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241007190908/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG/year-1-update">the Wayback machine</a>. </p>
<p>"Ubisoft's arena shooter XDefiant needs to do more to stand out from the crowd," said our Ollie after playing a preview build and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xdefiant-preview">walking away unconvinced</a>. It's not impossible to imagine improvements and redesigns might have seen the shooter eventually prosper. As Ubisoft themselves remind us, they have done it before with Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor. But it appears Ubisoft management no longer hope for such turnarounds. The result is clear: nearly 300 people now have to find new jobs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
