            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/workers-resources-soviet-republic">Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</a>, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun's very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.</p>
<p>"Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades," explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It's high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Aside from the USA and the British Isles, the DLC includes maps based on Austria, the Czech Republic, East Germany, France, Estonia and North Korea. "Every map will differ in terms of overall size and the challenges the local topography brings, and they will also come with pre-generated towns, cities, and infrastructure," the announcement release explains. "This will require players to mold and shape their nations over time in order to create a new wave of top-notch Soviet Republics."</p><p>I still haven't played Workers &amp; Resources, but I've greatly enjoyed reading Sin's articles about it. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/workers-resources-soviet-republic-review">her review of the 1.0 version</a> from June 2024, she paints a simultaneously appealing and terrifying picture of a game where setting up a recycling service or demolishing a mine requires you to implement a whole infrastructure of specialised workers, vehicles and buildings (there are also plenty of options to simplify the simulation, if desired).</p>
<p>"I could recite a litany of frustrations and wishes, but it would be dwarfed by the novella about how absorbing and fascinating Workers &amp; Resources is," Sin wrote. "I love its conceptual commitment to a planned economy that its genremates observe de facto but don't examine. Its complex models and processes built for the joy and satisfaction of watching them come together. Its foundations in Slovak history and experience, and its refusal to be like anything else."</p>
<p>Sin also has a piece from a couple years back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-ostriv-workers-resources-and-where-town-builders-ought-to-go-next">exploring how Workers &amp; Resources deviates from the liberal American idea of town-building epitomised by SimCity</a>. I imagine she'd be keen to see how the game stacks up when you actually transport it to North America, though I suspect there are mods that do this already. Sort of feels like the logical endgame here is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Sq1Nr58hM">go to space</a>. There are probably mods for that too.

</p><p>The Worlds Map DLC is out on 13th December via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, and will be localised into the same languages as the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-talking-s-about-us-half-life-2-mod-blacklists-a-handful-of-youtubers-as-anticitizens-and-blocks-them-from-playing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>There is some spiteful drama in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod is called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">Half-Life 2 Overcharged</a> and it is described by its creators as an "overhaul modification" with "brand new gameplay and post-processing features". It adds new Combine and alien enemies, plus a bunch of weapons. It was originally released in 2022 and attracted some ridicule from Half-Life modding fans for being underbaked. The enemy AI was broken, crashes were frequent, the weapons were underwhelming or needless, and there were plenty of lighting and graphical issues. </p>
<p>A lot of these problems were meticulously pointed out in videos by YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-v4twgwLR4p-g0mihJsLCw/about">"noclick"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RadiationHazardYT">"Radiation Hazard"</a>, who specialise in the Half-Life games and play a lot of mods for Valve's classic shooters. They didn't show any mercy in their judgement of this one, calling it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6xhEXs9M3c">"overhyped"</a>, for example, and cutting down the mod in what you might call a typical YouTuber style. </p>
<p>In the two years since that original release the mod saw some updates, and the YouTubers followed along, tracking changes and sometimes doing follow-up videos to address <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkRD5mhAtQ">whether or not the bugs had been fixed</a>. Some things did get fixed, yes, but many other problems persisted, and new issues even came up, such as strange ragdoll behaviour and vanishing enemies. </p><p>With the recent release of a 2.0 version, the video makers set out to cover the mod once again, only to discover that it would simply crash. An error message would appear, reading: "STOP talking SH1T about us". And any attempt to make the game run was unsuccessful. </p>
<p>"The developers used my Steam ID to somehow block me from playing the mod," said one of the affected players in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvsbZ18izA">a video calling out the modders</a>. "There is a line of code somewhere that was specifically written to block my account from playing this mod."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mod appears to have been hardcoded to include a list of four "anticitizens" who will be unable to play, according <a href="https://x.com/Comrade_Waluigi/status/1863354606757069134">to this tweet that exposes the modder's code</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> is now in full swing and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-overcharged">the mod's page on ModDB</a> is inundated with dozens of comments saying "The sun is leaking" - a reference to one of the mod's most recurring lighting glitches. I probably wouldn't have even heard of this mod if the creators had not been this bitter about the poor reception.</p><p>This is a very niche example of the act of blacklisting, which occurs in traditional games criticism as well. Kotaku has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293">blacklisted by Bethesda</a> in the past, for example, presumably for not writing positively enough about their games. We at RPS have never been told overtly by any publisher or developer that we're on a blacklist (why would they admit to that, after all?) but we can tell when it happens; a company becomes chronically uncommuncative, they are not forthcoming with review code, or refuse to answer our queries. Still, even the most bullish of developers have never actually programmed their games to boot out specific critical voices. That is  wild behaviour and, as you can see, it also backfires. No, smart devs save their codey shennanigans to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8256405.stm">catch pirates in funny ways</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-much-more-excited-for-avowed-after-hearing-the-team-say-that-what-makes-rpgs-special-is-missable-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I <em>am</em> smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/obsidians-new-first-person-rpg-avowed-channels-baldurs-gate-3-in-one-key-way-the-core-of-rpgs-that-makes-them-special-is-missable-content/">GamesRadar</a>.</p>

<p>The "core of RPGs that makes them special is missable content, to be honest, and it makes the experience feel so much more personal to how you play the game," Ritger says. You might find something special, but a mate finds something else instead. "It creates a very interesting dialog about the game," Ritger says, "and it makes your experience feel more personal to you."</p><p>For Avowed specifically, they’re aiming to allow for this with vertical environments. "We want to draw your attention to things we want you to engage with," says Ritger. "Like the lighthouse is very tall, and so everybody's going to see a big, tall thing and want to go climb. And so we want to support that as well. And you can do that, and you can jump off into the ocean, if you like. And so we try to draw your attention that way."</p>
<p>The irony of me just now saying that I like games that trust my intelligence, then Ritger saying “gamer brain make want climb big tall thing” is not lost on me. But he’s right, dammit.</p>
<p>This approach to design does, of course, raise a bit of a Schrodinger’s Cat: how am I supposed to enjoy content I don’t know is there? But the example I always find myself going back to is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> renegade/paragon conundrum. It’s well documented that something like 90% of players chose to play as paragon Shepard, which sounds like an enormous waste of resources on the surface, but it was having the option to deck a reporter that made your restraint feel all the more heroic.</p>
<p>On the development side, it’s also a matter of resources - which, as Larian’s Sven Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">has pointed out before</a> to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">PC Gamer</a> - can be a hard sell to publishers:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you see it, it'll scare you, as a shareholder, as a publisher, the very first thing you will try to do is get it under control—you will try to scope it, you will try to box it, you will try to control it, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. Because it's like, why are we spending a million dollars on a dragon, which nobody's ever going to see, except like five people who made that obscure choice? Because if they see it, they have to be happy too. So that's why I put the bloody dragon there, because that's the logical consequence of the things that they've done.</p></blockquote>
<p>How well Avowed will actually make good on this promise, and how much of this talk is easy piggybacking on excitement for another game that does wot Baldur’s Gate 3 done, we’ll have to wait and see. It looks like the game might have bigger issues, too. “There's also a broken-up sluggishness to it all,” is how Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-rickety-combat-feels-like-the-undoing-of-its-lush-fungal-world">felt about combat</a>. “Animations don't flow together very charismatically, which lends a curious, stuttery cadence to the ducking and diving.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about <a href="https://kernelmethod.org/notes/qud_worldmap/">a player-made map</a> of Caves Of Qud, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">reportedly excellent</a> sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you "chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations", represented as 2D <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.</p>
<p>"Is Caves Of Qud <em>really</em> 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.</p><!--more-->
<p>In fact, Caves Of Qud is bottomless. The game's world is partly procedurally generated, adding more levels as you descend, and the only real constraint is hardware. "You can go, in practical terms, till your computer's storage fills up with zones you've visited," Bucklew told me over email. The game is designed with a certain depth in mind, he added, but if you insist on burrowing further, the systems for generating encounters, treasure and so forth will strive to support this. "The designed max is about 50 levels deep but beyond that it is effectively limitless, and some of the parameters like rarity of encounters continue to grade with depth up to the maximum integer sizes."</p>
<p>Unearthing strange items is, of course, one of the principle incentives to keep digging. "I'm not sure the deepest place players have been," Bucklew went on. "But advanced players abusing the endgame absolutely go at least hundreds of levels deep using tools like spiral borers, typically to farm for extremely rare occurrences in the deep caves, like finding cryogenic clones of yourself, duplicating your inventory, and doing that several times."</p><p>The challenge is that Caves Of Qud's code grows more erratic with depth, as though the critical workings were being crushed and suffocated by the sheer weight of rock. While poking around for stories about Qud spelunking, I've stumbled on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/comments/17u459b/how_deep_down_can_you_go/">Reddit threads</a> about zones where every room contains a merchant, together with more routine complaints about laggy performance.</p>
<p>Bucklew acknowledges that obsessive delvers will face a variety of technical hiccups. "This is factually true and I've received several bug reports and performance reports from players doing this," he said. "One of the key performance cases for the new UI was a save game from a player who had transformed into a crystalline monstrosity and descended at least 500 levels deep and duplicated their inventory 8 or 9 times, and was running into performance issues stepping on a stack of yet another clone with thousands of items."</p>
<p>I'm not sure I personally have the patience, or leftover lifespan, to play 2,147,483,646 levels of Caves Of Qud. But I do love the idea of a world without a bottom: there's something both harrowing and comforting about the knowledge that you can always keep digging. I also love terrain generators that misbehave when you roam too far, as with <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/2891447-how-to-get-to-the-far-lands-easy-fast-and-without">the horizon-wide walls of Junji Ito-ass geology</a> encountered in certain editions of Minecraft. It's as though you were slowly transiting between the realms of two gods - the god of art, craft and intentionality, and the god of luck, white noise and decay.</p>
<p>Anyway, Caves Of Qud <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/">leaves early access on 5th December</a>, and seems likely to entertain even if you confine yourself resolutely to the surface. Prodigious catacombs aside, it's got mushroom infestations, goat-charming, spider possession, and "a novel’s worth of handwritten lore". The existing version is already one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
