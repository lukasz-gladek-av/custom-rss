            <p>MDK was a 1997 shooter in which you played a pointy headed janitor named Kurt Hectic with a parachute suit and a gun for an arm, the best thing about it being its Giger-ish <a href="https://psxdatacenter.com/images/screens/P/M/SLES-00599/ss6.jpg">sniper mode interface</a>. MDK is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mortality-decomp-killers">Mortality Decomp. Killers</a> - a sour lollipop puke hued <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/post-void">Post Void</a>-like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a>'s lethality and a very good spinny knifey move. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560730/MORTALITY_DECOMP_KILLERS/">completely free on Steam</a>, although you can pick up the soundtrack for a few quid if you fancy supporting it. After each level, your score breakdown includes how many doors you've "killed". Not since my beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mullet-mad-jack">Mullet Mad Jack</a> has a game facilitated such reckless hinge hatred.</p>

<p>You play as Clive, a jaw-headed detective resurrected by a parasite and recruited into a secret taskforce, with the secret task of killing many people with a six shooter revolver and machete. The game lies in surviving ultra-lethal encounters by timing your reloads well, using cover smartly, and knowing when to use an excellent machete swing with some deeply satisfying forward propulsion. The game "contains lots of gore and violence against crooks and criminals," reads the content warning, which I'm sure the Hays code would approve of.</p>
<p>There's also a "noir mode" if you find the, I assume, deliberately headachey visuals a bit <em>too </em>headachey. Also, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560730/MORTALITY_DECOMP_KILLERS/">latest patch</a> includes the note: "added 'Invert Y' sensitivity setting for FREAKS", which I approve of. Again, it's very free, seemingly forever, and is worth the small download just for that machete spin.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mortality-decomp-killers-is-a-free-post-void-like-that-scores-you-on-how-many-doors-youve-killed]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, a free-to-play mech shooter from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> devs Wargaming, was only revealed last December. An early access release in April this year followed that Keighley Awards cameo, and just three months on, the game's been given a shutdown date.</p>
<p>It's not quite a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>-level speedrun from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">the live-service cradle to the live-service grave</a>, but it's still a pretty quick one.</p>

<p>"Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters," Wargaming wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english">an update post</a> on Steam, "You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p>
<p>Wargaming will be keeping the game's servers running for three more months, meaning they'll shut down around October 8th. Between now and then, the devs will be rolling out stuff like custom game support, a game mode that has every mech unlocked so folks can try out any they fancy, and a "farewell tournament" organised via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/steelhunters">game's Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>Our Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-tanks-creators-reveal-steel-hunters-which-isnt-quite-world-of-mechs">saw a bit of Steel Hunters</a> while he was at the Game Awards, and wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>I can’t say I’m blown away by what I’ve seen of Steel Hunters. It’s a cobbling together of genres and sci-fi archetypes that already feels like it’s going to ride principally on the association with World Of Tanks. It seems sturdily-made, however, and I’m kind of charmed by Wargaming’s ridiculous insistence on having their very own word for co-op teamwork – "Duo Symbiosis".</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping the devs and players who made and were digging Steel Hunters can enjoy these final few months with the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steel-hunters-the-mech-shooter-from-world-of-tanks-devs-gets-a-shutdown-date-just-three-months-after-releasing-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>
