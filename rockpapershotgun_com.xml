            <p>Remember Brendan from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? If the answer's no, I don't blame you. He's a talking vending machine you can run into and end up going off on a short series of side quests about, but I totally missed him in my fist couple of playthroughs. Anyway, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, but that quest arc in the base game ends pretty tragically, something a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">modder</a>'s now changed via the addition of an extra bit which lets you pay to have the semi-sentient snack box installed in V's flat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Cyberpunk modder Deceptious is behind this short extra mission, which they've dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25629?tab=description">Brendan's Death Song</a>' in honour of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song I can't admit often makes it into my playlists. I'm more of a basic Californicationy kinda bloke, what can I say?</p>
<p>With this work installed, after running into Brendan the vending machine outside of Megabuilding H8 in Japantown and running through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/I_Can_See_Clearly_Now">trio of quests</a> involving him, things usually end with him telling a final gag before undergoing a programming change that'll get rid of his chatty quirkiness. Think the ending of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, except Roy Batty's spent his life giving out more free snacks than he should have.</p>
<p>But, what if Harrison Ford could have paid some dudes to pick up Roy Batty, bring him back to life, and install him in the wall of Deckard's flat? Sounds pretty horrifying to be honest, but it's probably a lot less horrifying when this mod does it as a way of letting you keep a bit of Brendan in your cyber-life. Once the machine's been added to the default Megabuilding H10 apartment via a quest heavy on text messages, he'll be available for some brief conversation and occasionally dish out a free drink.</p>
<p>"He goes silent during partner dates in H10, but does have a small change of appearance when the partner is there," Deceptious teases, in case you were worried about being virtually cockblocked by a coin-operated flatmate.</p>
<p>To get the mod up and running, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious' Quest Core</a>, plus standard Cyberpunk advanced tweak enablers <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>. Oh, and a tolerance for groan-worthy gags. Let's face it though, if you saw the headline of this article with my name in the byline and have read this far, you've almost certainly got that. Or you just like hearing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">intriguing Cyberpunk mods</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have announced another round of layoffs, their third round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" are losing their livelihoods, and claim this is necessary "to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<p>This year alone had already seen Crystal Dynamics lay off staff in two waves, with 17 employees being <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">let go in March</a> and an unspecified number of others <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">handed their marching orders in August</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with that August round, these latest layoffs were announced via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF">LinkedIn post</a>. "We've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation," the studio wrote. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition."</p>
<p>"We've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," they added.</p>
<p>So far, principal animator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7394854027055910913-ko9W">Shamil Rasizade</a> and producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samanthadobes_opentowork-activity-7394845983777619968-jCKp">Samantha Dobes</a> have posted to LinkedIn that they've been let go as part of these cuts. "It’s been a fun 12 years, and I will greatly miss everyone. But I suppose it’s time to join the army of unemployed game devs. You know how it goes these days. If you hear of anything, please let me know," the former wrote.</p>
<p>Solidarity and best of luck to all those affected by these layoffs.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> creators Rockstar have been called out by a member of the UK parliament for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">dismissing 31 Rockstar North employees</a> in an alleged instance of union-busting. The politician in question, Christine Jardine of Edinburgh West and the Liberal Democrats, says that she has been approached by several of the fired developers, whom Rockstar accuse of leaking confidential information during conversations with union organisers in a private Discord channel. 
</p>
<p>
Jardine has asked the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> company for more details, and wants a meeting with a government minister to discuss support for the affected workers. Intriguingly, she acknowledges that she has a conflict of interest in that one of her own employees also currently works for Rockstar.
</p>
<p>
"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," Jardine wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cajardinemp.bsky.social/post/3m5jgfa3dis2m">a social media post</a> last night, following the House of Commons session in question. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again." The post includes a video in which she gives a longer account, below.
</p>
<blockquote>
I declare an interest because I have an employee who works for the company I'm about to mention, though they are not affected by the actions taken. That company is videogame company Rockstar, who's fired at least 30 employees across its UK studios, including Rockstar North in Edinburgh. Several of my constituents have been affected, and some came to see me last week to express those concerns. They claim they have been sacked because they were trying to unionise, and discussing working conditions in private. But Rockstar have accused them of distributing confidential information, and sacked them for gross misconduct. I've written to Rockstar to ask for information on the issue, but I wondered, can I can have a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what steps can be taken to support [the fired Rockstar staff].
</blockquote>
<p>
Last week, RPS attended two pickets organised by the IWGB game workers union to protest the Rockstar North firings. At <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">a London gathering</a> outside Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive's offices, IWGB president Alex Marshall defended the right of the developers to organise and discuss their jobs in meetings attended by union members. He called Rockstar's claims about leaked material "completely disingenuous". The union are taking Rockstar to court over the firings.
</p><p>
In Edinburgh, meanwhile, freelancer Alan Wen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">spoke to several of the affected developers</a>, who claimed that union membership at Rockstar reached the legal minimum required for statutory recognition under UK law shortly before the mass firings. One protestor at the Edinburgh gathering characterised Rockstar's allegations of "gross misconduct" as a "nuclear option" to shut down the unionisation drive before it could gather too much momentum.
</p>
<p>220 Rockstar North staff have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/220-rockstar-staff-sign-letter-to-management-calling-for-immediate-reinstatement-of-fired-workers">signed an open letter to management</a> calling for the immediate reinstatement of the fired workers. Further protests have been held in London and outside Take-Two's Paris headquarters. There's another Edinburgh rally due on 18th November outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood.</p>
<p>
Shortly after the firings, Rockstar and Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">pushed back the release of GTA 6 to November next year</a>. It doesn't strain credulity that company leadership might see a unionised workforce as a threat to their ability to impose certain working conditions, in order to ship the now repeatedly delayed game. Rockstar recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">mandated a return to the office</a>, in reports confirmed by several of the Rockstar North workers, and staff have crunched on projects in the past. It's also credible that Rockstar might be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of project secrets going walkies following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-confirm-gta-6-leaks-but-say-it-wont-have-any-long-term-effect-on-development">a massive leak of GTA 6 materials</a> back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time GTA 6 and Rockstar have been brought up in a parliamentary session this week. Far right Polish politician Witold Tumanowicz of the Confederation Liberty and Independence group broached the "disturbing matter" of the GTA 6 delay in <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1988328220757028917?s=19">footage shared on Tuesday</a>, presumably hoping to score some #based points with his online groupies.
