<p>A question, readers. What sounds more fun: doddering about on your own two feet – like an <em>idiot</em> – or storming through deserts on a cannon-packing megacrab? I only make such a clearly self-answering inquiry because for some reason DuneCrawl, or at least the Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833200/DuneCrawl/">demo</a> that shows off its isometric action, seems to think both sides have valid points.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They do not. I’ve played solo and with licensed crustacean pilot Brendy in co-op, and on neither occasion did the on-foot combat sections click. There are rare moments of comedy chaos, where one teammate accidentally detonates another in the midst of blasting an enemy or breaking open a cracked wall, but ultimately it feels less like a swashbuckling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> and more like a kind of multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deaths-door">Death’s Door</a> where everyone’s on their fifth G&amp;T. All awkward swordfighting, sluggish shooting, and constant rolling in place of positioning nous.</p>

<p>Then you get on the big crab, and it fuckin’ rocks. Beyond the simple, base pleasures of duelling other battle walkers on a manor-sized shellfish, this is where DuneCrawl finally starts feeling like a proper co-op game. With one player at the helm, others will scurry hurriedly around the deck, loading and firing cannons while slathering on goop to heal the crab’s damaged legs. The demo only contains one crawler-versus-crawler duel, but it’s easily the highlight: a delightfully shambolic spectacle that, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guns-icarus-online">Guns of Icarus</a> dogfight or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> naval clash, manages to feel pacey and urgent in spite of the inherent unwieldiness of the craft involved.</p>
<p>I’d say that DuneCrawl would be better if you never left the crab, but then that would deny it two of its funniest quirks. One: it’s possible to be blown off the deck entirely by enemy fire, a detail I could appreciate from the vantage point of thirty feet in the air after a cannonball flung me clear of Crawl McCartney (Brendy let me name the crab) and into the sand below. Two: it’s possible, if not outright encouraged, to fire yourself out of friendly or captured cannons, which is perfect for countering landbound defences or boarding a hostile walker in a hurry. I know I said the on-foot battles aren’t as good, but I’ll make a temporary exception for whenever I want to aerially deliver myself face-first onto the bad guys’ main deck.</p>

<p>There is some non-endearing jank that needs addressing. Performance is weirdly ropey for a game that thinks photorealism is how plants eat sunlight, my RTX 3090 stuttering heavily at 1440p. And the demo’s invisible boundary, an otherwise understandable roadblock to just sauntering off and exploring the entire game’s desert for free, forced mine and Brendy’s adventure into an ignominious end. While searching for more crawlers to fight, the barrier bumped us clean off ol’ McCartney, while letting our crab stumble further into the forbidden zone on his own momentum and making him impossible to retrieve, forcing a long, dusty walk back to base.</p>
<p>A shame, as we were well up for more stompy crab fights at that point. I for one still am, provided the full game doesn’t keep me on land for too long in exchange.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2023, the <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion</a> team <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1672629175037972482?s=20">announced</a> that their project to recreate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine was on track for a 2025 release date. Well, steal my sweet rolls and shout me off a mountain, the mad candles have gone and done it. At least, that's the plan according to a <a href="https://youtu.be/Dvlz8CYCQzc">new live gameplay demo and Q&amp;A video</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrim-has-a-new-video-looks-amazing-is-set-for-release-this-year-and-i-struggle-to-imagine-the-rumoured-official-oblivion-remake-doing-much-better/">PC Gamer</a>.)</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/">Skywind</a>) has been in development since 2012, made by a team of experienced volunteers. "It's coming along incredibly," says mechanics lead Scott Whiting in the above video, "we're confident we can get it out this year." The video shows off the city of Cheydinhal, with NPC interactions and quests. I'm especially impressed by the UI here, striking a lovely balance between Skyrim's pared-down readability and Oblivion's more ornate parchment. As well as recreating Oblivion's huge world, the team are also adding music tracks and sprucing up dungeon environments so they better match the regions they're found in.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a team of volunteers working for over 10 years purely for the love of the game wasn't heartening enough, they also managed to raise $1200 for Make-A-Wish International during the stream.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've played Oblivion, although I do vaguely remember some sort of famous 'horse amour' controversy, in which conservative news pundits waxed hysterical about the game letting you marry your equine companion (the official terminology decided on by Bethesda after the word 'mount' was deemed inappropriate).</p>
<p>As for the fabled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 6</a>? We know as much as you do. Unless you know more than us, in which case do tell because that news piece would obviously do gangbusters. My own personal tinfoil hat theory is that Bethesda are holding back until they've devised some nefarious new scheme to monetise it in hitherto unimaginably irksome ways, but that's based on nothing except years of observing the game industry with my own two eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My lunch yesterday consisted of air fried lumps of failed pizza dough from a disastrous first batch. One of my new year's resolutions was to learn how to make flawless pizza. This might be against the spirit of asceticism these goals usually incorporate, but such puritan edicts have no place here. The platonically perfect slice, like hailstones battering the word 'bum' into soft cement, is a natural marvel impervious to notions of morality both spiritual and profane.</p>
<p>Would the dough have turned out better if I'd sought the help of Into The Restless Ruins's harvest maiden, who grants the desires of those who petition her? Oh. <em>Oh</em>. The 'harvest' refers to slaughter, not grain. Should have guessed really.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is a roguelite dungeon crawler deckbuilder. A yawnsome genre prospect on paper, until I noticed that the dungeon you crawl is one you build yourself from your deck. Hang on! That's a bit like the original <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1634/warhammer-quest">Warhammer Quest</a>, my beloved! Only where the tabletop game used a randomised dungeon tile deck to create a sense of mystery, this one inverts the idea by having you build and plan your route before each run.</p>
<p>To a backdrop of chunky 80's synthpop, you'll begin each night by drawing a hand of five tile cards. Some of them are plain corridors or junction points, some are rooms with special effects. A damage-buffing armoury, say, or a place to heal. You get three build points, which normally means you can place three tiles. Your goal here is to go from entrance to exit by unlocking progressively deeper sections of the dungeon through locked seals, which require collectibles. But you also need to return to the entrance at the end of each run before your health runs out, either through combat or because you've let your torch die. You can place bonfire rooms which replenish your torch, but they might end up making your overall layout a little awkward, and it's possible to get completely blocked out of progression.</p>
<p>Your character swings their weapon automatically, but you can finesse combat through movement and positioning. Slain enemies drop glimour, and the harvest maiden will grant you new room cards when you collect enough. You can keep runs short and safe but there's an ominous counter that fills up each night at the top of the screen. I'm certain something bad happens if it fills but I always blocked myself off and had to restart before it got to that point.</p>
<p>This is all wrapped up in Scottish folklore, which is where the harvest maiden comes from, although that version of her <em>was</em> all about the grain. Storytelling is svelte during the actual runs, but room tiles do have snatches of detail. A training room where blood seeps from the dummies. A campfire you can't feel the warmth from. But I think my favourite thing here is - as far as I could tell - you can't pull the map up during the actual runs, which means you have to navigate from plans and memory, perhaps building yourself entire mazes of health and bonfire buffs off to one side to let you harvest glimour. I could have just pressed every key on my keyboard and seen if any of them brought the map up, but I'm choosing to believe this is deliberate because I like the implications. I did press, like, four of them.</p>
<p>If I had to describe it in a single word, I'd say "addicting". And then I'd beat myself up because the correct word is "addictive". And then I'd beat myself up some more because that's a horribly nefarious and cold word to describe something as lovingly made as a nice videogame. Ahem: I had to tear myself away and I want to play more of it. On the wishlist it goes.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877770/Into_the_Restless_Ruins/">Into The Restless Ruins' demo on Steam here</a>. It's due out this April from Wales Interactive and Ant Workshop Ltd, whose previous forays into ill-lit catacombs include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2144040/Dungeon_Golf/">Dungeon Golf</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
