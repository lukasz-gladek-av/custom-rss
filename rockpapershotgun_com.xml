            <p>When the website of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> suddenly began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-highguards-website-goes-dark-a-report-emerges-that-the-not-so-indie-shooter-was-funded-by-tencent">blaring that it was "unavailable"</a> not long after news broke of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">layoffs at developer Wildlight</a>, you could have been forgiven for thinking a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>-style pulling offline might be in the shooter's near future. That doesn't look to be the case, though, with the studio having just announced a couple of new additions set to arrive in the game this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These additions are a new base called Cloudreach and a raid toll called the Lockpick, both of which are set to arrive in a patch set to drop "later this week". The base is noteworthy for being home to a massive airship, which sounds like a key element in keeping battles on it varied. "The deck surrounding the airship overlooks the entire area, giving defenders an elevated position to snipe from, but allows quick repositioning to both generator rooms, where combat quickly turns close quarters," Wildlight wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lockpick isn't a lockpick. It's actually a dart gun you can fire to "open doors and windows, temporarily disabling them for the enemy and giving control to your team". I guess calling it the Handle's Worst Enemy instead would have been a bit lame. Anyway, the patch is also delivering a mount called a Moonbruin, which look a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Owlbears.</p> <div>

<p>"We are also working on our next patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things," Wildlight wrote to round out their post.</p><p>So, the shooter's set to keep on trucking for the time being, with this patch news backing up an <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">admin on the official Highguard Discord</a>'s assertion earlier this week that the website being down was simply a matter of fixing it currently being "low priority".</p>
