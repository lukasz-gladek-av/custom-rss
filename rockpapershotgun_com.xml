            <p>It seems as if every "wholesome" game is either a Stardewlike or a Animal Crossingbut. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-rocket-lab-is-a-factorio-and-stardew-valley-mashup-about-building-a-rocketship-in-a-cute-town">Little Rocket Lab</a>? Stardewlike. Piece By Piece? Animal Crossingbut. To be more specific, it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside. If you can't get enough of upcycling in Trash Goblin, here's one more for you.

<p>Counter to its cosy vibes, the press release threatens an iota of challenge to your management. "If you think this'll be a walk in the park, Piece by Piece is going to outfox you," it says. "Each day you'll need to tidy up your store, attend to anyone who needs help, then throw a bunch of stuff on sale and see if you can make a tasty profit. Being a good samaritan is great and all, but this fox needs to put food on the table!"
</p>
<p>I am betting I can't end up losing my shop to debt collectors, but maybe I'm wrong.
</p>
<p>I've whizzed through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> presentation tonight and written up this and three other stories, representing the most interesting news and games present at the show in my opinion. To cast some judgement across the field: these all seem like pleasant games which could be fun to play, but they're all so derivative, all of them riffing on the same two or three core concepts. It's faintly exhausting. Obviously other genres or tones of games do the same, but this is less "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting" and more "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting realistic weapons specifically, in a modern military setting, with a sniper mission in the desert." Even the dialogue boxes seem familiar.
</p><p>In a way "Animal Crossingbut" is the generous way to describe these games, because at least it requires a "but", suggesting some innovation. I'm not sure that's the case if I compare Piece By Piece to Trash Goblin (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407830/Trash_Goblin/">on Steam</a> in Early Access) or any of the other shop sims in recent years.
</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong. Piece By Piece is aiming for release in early 2025 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179050/Piece_by_Piece/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ooh, this feels like the biggest news out of this evening's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> showcase: nourishing photography adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is getting a sequel, appropriately called Toem 2. It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

<p>I know precious little about Toem 2 as I write this, hours in advance of the trailer's broadcast. I've got a single sentence description of the game, all the details of which I used in the opening paragraph. By the time you're reading this, however, you may be able to <a href="https://s.team/a/2900640">head to the Toem 2 Steam page</a> for more detail and screenshots.
</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that Alice B liked the original game a great deal for its straightforward pleasures. "It's just fun, isn't it? It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free," she wrote in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>That's good enough for me. I like a spot of in-game photography and cute worlds where I can do favours for people, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>. I really should get round to playing Toem.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
