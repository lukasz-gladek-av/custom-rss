            <p>Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> rolled onto the, er, battlefield late last week, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-here-and-nearly-2800-words-so-whip-out-your-reading-specs-private">huge patch having been smashed against its hull</a> to see it off, EA and their Battlefield Studios have understandably only put out a few more tweaks. Their latest little round of changes are server-side rather than being a proper patch, and enact a bit of balancing clearly deemed too important to wait for the next big patch's deployment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is the point at which I'm going to ask you to hold the hands of any mates of yours who use sniper rifles, specifically the M2010 ESR and PSR. The muzzle velocity of both long-range skull-deleters has been toned down. For the ESSER, it's gone from 900 to 800 meters a second. For the PISSR, a smaller tweak from 750 to 720 meters a second has been made.</p>
<p>Thus, esserers and pisserers will have to compensate for the slower speed of bullets leaving their barrels by leading shots on moving targets a bit more. If it's any solace, they've opted to use some of the longest guns out there, so odds are they're used to compensating for things.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we've rolled out a few backend changes across our servers, which should now be live across all platforms. The changes are as follows:</p><p>◼️Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).<br>◼️Reduced the muzzle velocity of…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Also among the tweaks is one which'll force <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m87a1-loadout-guide">shotgun</a> projectiles to take drag into account. Odds are that abiding by the laws of physics will amount to a nerf of some level. Maybe a support group which excludes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m433-loadout-guide">assault rifle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-l110-loadout-guide">machine gun</a> lot should be formed.</p><p>Finally, in non-weapon tweak news, Battlefield Studios have increased the ticket count for some rush maps from 75 to 100. So, there'll be more reinforcements on offer if you suddenly find your gun of choice isn't packing enough oomph to save you from regular murder at the hands of faceless strangers who may or may not tastelessly pause to crouch atop your corpse.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another post-release tweak Battlefield Studios made over the weekend was a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958">fix for jumping momentum being mucked up</a> when certain weapons were equipped. I assume that being rectified elicited an uninterrupted bounce of joy.</p>
