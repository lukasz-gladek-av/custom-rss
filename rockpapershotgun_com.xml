        <p>It "could bring new advertisers to our service"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Twitch have <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">introduced</a> a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.</p>
<p>Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brandsâ€™ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."</p> <!--more-->
<p>Streamers who fail to use the label appropriately will receive email warnings and eventually, have their accounts suspended. Twitch may also intervene to apply labels without the streamer's say-so.
</p>
<p>
The measures were <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">announced on 1st November</a>, and seem obviously timed to control the circulation of polemics during the US presidential elections on 5th November. The post above links to <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">a longer but far from complete breakdown of the new content category</a> - here are some examples of streams that will need the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label in future:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies
</p>
<p>
Live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes
</p>
<p>
Livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies
</p>
<p>
Discussing military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters
</p>
<p>
Discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion
</p>
<p>
Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As for what doesn't require a label, Twitch are fine with "streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate. For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote." They're also OK with "intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues".
</p><p>
As many Twitch users have <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1852370050335887512">pointed out on social media</a>, all these designations are quite blurry and therefore, <a href="https://x.com/MoonlightBVT/status/1852856903875100985">easy to twist and weaponise</a> against vulnerable groups. What does "intermittent" mean, exactly, as a proportion of total streaming time? Does "sharing knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner" become "advocacy" when the facts presented lead to certain conclusions? 
</p>
<p>
The ambiguity leaves the new category open to bad-faith reporting. The requirement to categorise "political" streams so people and advertisers can avoid them might also have a chilling effect on discussion of political narratives and themes in video games. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, for example, makes diversity a cornerstone of its writing, but a streamer discussing that would presumably risk having their streams labelled poliical and so, losing access to a chunk of potential viewers and ad revenue.

            <p>When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> launched into early access in September it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">somewhat messy</a>. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.</p>
<p>It's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Far from making things more difficult, the water thieves are really a way to give players who run out of water one last chance to scrape back from the loot wipe. They'll show up in your headquarters when you have basically no water left, and if you can manage to kill them and defend your home you'll get some water from their corpses and stave off the hideous thirstwipe for the time being. Fail to kill the home invaders and you'll suffer the usual consequences. </p>

<p>The water thieves are just one addition in the game's recent October update, which is mainly a bunch of bug fixes, a new map, and a frightening new mech boss called "the Rat King". You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4455841997094125639?snr=1_5_9_">the full patch notes here</a> but it basically seems to be the biggest update to the game so far, featuring more quests, a means of "AI buddy control" and some "AI pathing and combat improvements." Hopefully that means the enemies won't act quite as unpredictably as I've previously witnessed. </p><p>Meanwhile, the water system tweaks are not over, the developers say, as it's still a source of both confusion and annoyance for some folks. There are those who hate the way it gnaws at you even when you're not playing, and there are those who think it's not a big deal at all, insisting it's easy to find sufficient water in the battlefield to stay stocked up for a long time. I just feel it's the least of the game's design difficulties. Maybe picking up items should be less fiddly first? Maybe enemy sightlines should be more reliably knowable? Maybe tanks shouldn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U-ktTg7ACeI">fly into orbit</a>? There are a lot of things that make the moment-to-moment antics in these captivating death zones feel janky. Taken altogether, I'd say that's a bigger issue than one dwindling resource. </p>
<p>If you want to get a feel for the game without buying it, there's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4542536020217823369?snr=1_5_9_">a demo</a>, in which you can only play alongside other demo users. It only has one map to enlootify - the Ashen Mesa. It's one of the better battle zones of the game from what I've played. But you can also see what the player headquarters looks like. All my quibbles with the game's rough state aside, it has some very good-looking environments. It's worth playing the demo just to indulge in a bit of mech war tourism. If you find any water, let me know. I won't steal it. Promise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
