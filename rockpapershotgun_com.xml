            <p>
It is not exactly a secret that, in recent years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> hasn't been doing so hot. Frequenters of the pseudo-MMO have found certain expansions and updates to be disappointing, and for a live service game a few too many disappointments can be devastating. Now, in a new interview, the game's director Tyson Green has acknowledged how the game is struggling to bring in a new audience, and discussed the difficulties that come with that.
</p>
<p>
"For years now, Destiny has been on this steady hardening of the core [audience]," Green said, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>. "More and more core players are staying and playing the game, but relatively few [new] people come into the game. There's a tightening and contraction, and this presents problems for a game that you're trying to maintain as a live service, especially when you want to keep serving those core players with great, compelling expansions."
</p>
<p>
Part of the issue, Green thinks, is that Destiny 2's expansion The Final Shape, which essentially wrapped up the main story Bungie had been working on nigh on a decade. They found that those that played it felt satisfied, but "the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?"
</p>
<p>
Of course, as Green notes, from a business perspective this isn't what they had planned, and he noted that they wanted to and want to keep working within the world of Destiny. "There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something."
</p><p>
That something is the game's new Fate saga, the latest addition of that being the Star Wars themed Renegades. I'm not a Destiny person myself, and I can tell you personally that has someone who has floated the idea of picking the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> up, Star Wars does nothing for me (I think brand crossovers are the devil's work, particularly in narrative-driven live service games), and just how much of the story is vaulted away makes it feel not particularly worth it either.
</p><p>

Perhaps slightly soberingly, Green also said that he thinks Bungie have "been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny."

</p><p>
There are whispers from a source whose reputability I can't quite determine, so take this with the tiniest pinches of salt, <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752">that Destiny 3 is in the works</a>, but I am wondering if this isn't the trump card Bungie may want it to be. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">Marathon as it is</a>, well, Bungie can't really afford to make any mistakes.

Look, ok, I get it Square Enix. I understand why you put 2B in absolutely everything. She is a character with particular qualities that certain audiences found very appealing! But I am begging you… stop putting her in things. I'm sick to death of seeing her everywhere, her blindfolded eyes somehow still staring directly into my soul, begging me to spend money on endless gacha rolls, but this time in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a>, the next game she's set to appear in.
</p>
<p>
It's even easier to understand why she's in this one, it's another Square Enix game after all, they don't even have to do any annoying brand deals. On this particular occasion, rather than as a playable character (presumably because her fighting Sephiroth was too much for even Square Enix), 2B will be a boss fight you can take on. Which means that really, the main draw will be the outfits for a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> characters.

<p>
The two graced and/or cursed depending on how you look at it with such outfits are everyone's favourite ninja Yuffie, puppy-boy Cloud, and the more predictable choice out of the two, Tifa. I fear for what this might do to Clerith shippers that think this is a sign that Square Enix has a preference, but I digress.
</p><p>
More than anything, I would just like Square Enix to let Yoko Taro either make or, if they are working on one, announce a new… anything, honestly, but a fresh entry into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>'s world would be nice. The poor moon-shaped head lad can't seem to catch a break at the moment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-creator-yoko-taro-would-like-you-to-know-he-has-been-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-cancelled">what with him saying games he's been working on keep getting cancelled</a>. We're quickly approaching Automata's 10th anniversary! Let the endearing oddball get on with it.
