            <p>When the tragically half-empty hooch barrel of potential that was Capone 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-sin">Empire Of Sin</a> launched back in late 2020, it also sold a pass pledging two story expansions down the line. The first of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/empire-of-sins-first-dlc-and-major-free-update-launch-november-18th">arrived in 2021</a>. Time and more time passed, prompting a union of shaking fists to wave grubby promissory notes scrawled on diner hamburger wrappers and brace themselves for a trampling by the proverbial Pinkerton agents on horseback of continued disappointment. Despite this, that second DLC never materialised.</p>
<p>Do not fear the sound you hear. The Pinkerton's have not found you - it is simply the heavy clopping of legal obligations being grudgingly fulfilled. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Hunt For Aurora is now available</a>, assuming there's anyone left with the energy to avail it.</p>

<p>Romero Games haven't returned for this one. It's been developed by Moonmana, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628460/Ultimate_pirates/">shonky Pirate MMO fame</a>. The DLC centres around new boss Robin Kray and partner Sylvia Taylor trying to nab "the Aurora diamond". I don't know much about diamonds aside from the absurd onslaught of 60's marketing that popularised the engagement ring, and the capitalisation prompted me to look up the Aurora, although the most interesting piece of information I came away with is that "Fancy" is an actual proper grading term, which I enjoy quite a bit. Nevertheless, "crime friends want shiny rock" feels like a worthy enough setup.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Steam has to say</a> about Hunt For Aurora.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>New Boss:</strong> Robin Kray</li>
<li><strong>New Side Character:</strong> Sylvia Taylor</li>
<li><strong>New Gangster Class:</strong> Vanguard (melee and versatile combat builds)</li>
<li><strong>New Racket:</strong> Dance Clubs</li>
<li><strong>Lucky Companion:</strong> A loyal dog with uncanny good luck</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal Expansion:</strong> High-power Prototype Pistol, Plains Rifle, Model 21 Shotgun, M1886 Sniper Fusil, Irma Submachine Gun, MP 28 Submachine Gun, and Brn. Vz. 26 Machine Gun</li>
<li><strong>6 deadly melee weapons:</strong> P1907, Hooked Quillon Bayonet, 10'' Chefâ€™s Knife, Hunting Knife, Balisong, and Fish Knife</li>
<li><strong>4 New Mission Chains:</strong> Dive into 14 missions in total!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I haven't played Empire Of Sin for a very long time. If you have, can you please let me know if there's likely to be a tangible difference between the Chef's Knife and the Fish Knife?</p>
<p>I chatted to Romero Games back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-empire-of-sins-new-updates-are-adding-more-strategy-more-drama-and-truth-thats-stranger-than-fiction">2021 about the future of Empire Of Sin</a>, following a huge patch. I'd be very interested to learn the full story of how the game was effectively abandoned, because Brenda and the team sounded very motivated at the time.</p></div>
