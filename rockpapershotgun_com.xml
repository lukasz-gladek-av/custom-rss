            <p>Many moons ago, Danish developers Playdead released bleak platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-limbo">proved beyond reasonable doubt</a> that Gamez R Art, while also giving a bunch of witless scriveners massive arachnophobia. Today, we learn that one of the studio's co-founders, Arnt Jensen, is suing the other, Dino Patti, amid competing claims about the scale of his contribution to Limbo. Because of course all great things must end in calamity.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our source of this story is Patti himself, who left Playdead in 2017 after the release of the wonderfully awful/awfully wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a>, and is currently boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/somerville">Somerville</a> developer Jumpship. He and Jensen have famously not been on great terms for years, but things <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">came to a boil in late 2024</a>, when Patti published an account of Limbo's development on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Back in March this year, Jensen argued that the LinkedIn post exaggerates Patti's contribution to Limbo, insisting that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game." He also claimed that the post includes an "unauthorised" photo.</p>
<p>For this alleged infringement, Playdead asked for 500,000 Danish kroner or $72,630 as "suitable compensation and reimbursement." Now, Patti has revealed that Playdead's lawyers are taking him to court in a podcast interview this week with Danish site <a href="https://arkaden.dk/nyheder/dino-patti-der-kommer-en-retsag/">Arkaden</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/limbo-and-inside-studios-new-game-is-a-3rd-person-open-world-sci-fi-adventure/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>For his part, Patti contends that Jensen is trying to delete him from the game's origin story. "Arnt, please stop the bullying. I will not stop being who I am," he declared back in March. "I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." In the Arkaden podcast, Patti is upbeat about the situation, commenting that it's an opportunity to set the record straight, but with all due respect to the guy, that's the kind of thing you say when you're being sued.</p>
<p>None of this interferes with my eagerness to hear about Playdead's next game, "a third person science fiction adventure set in a remote corner of the universe", which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdead-reveal-art-for-their-secretive-inside-follow-up">revealed in 2017</a>. At the risk of sounding like I'm picking my favourite dad, I've yet to play Somerville, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">described</a> as an "interesting, if not particularly deep" spin on the Playdead school of apocalyptic minimalism.</p>
<p>I will ask Playdead and Jumpship for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the game about kicking it in the goal from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/absolver">Absolver</a> devs Sloclap, have launched today, June 19th. The folks behind it have rung in that occasion by outlining a bunch of their future plans, as well as saying they're very sorry you can't currently show off your mouse and keyboard skills by nutmegging some fool who owns one of those ex-boxers.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, crossplay and a bunch of other stuff are in the works for future updates to the foot-to-ball thing Nic and James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-and-nic-kick-a-thing-sloclaps-rematch-edition">dug the beta of</a>, and that currently sits fourth in Steam's top sellers list.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kicking off a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch message</a> (sorry, had to), Sloclap explained that crossplay didn't end up happening in time for Rematch's release because of "unforeseen technical complexities", continuing: "We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn’t be available at launch, and we’re sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>
<p>The devs said they have got a "basic working version from a technical standpoint", and getting that over the line is their "absolute highest priority" right now. So, you should be able to unleash your inner Roy Keane on some unsuspecting fool who bought a different video game box soonish.</p>
<p>Aside from that, SloClap are aiming to show a bunch of technical gremlins that folks reported throughout Early Access the red card (sorry again, I once took a football to the face as a small child and have never really recovered). Lag, stuttering, frame drops, and "player characters and the ball seemingly moving across the pitch unpredictably" are on the hit list.</p>
<p>The devs also have their eyes on a host of improvements and additions for future updates, including tournaments, the ability to create your own club, and bots you can train against. The likes of spectating your squad’s game when you join one and a way to let players team up and rematch with teammates they've liked having a kickabout with are also on the list in terms of social stuff, to go alongside that crossplay. </p>
<p>As for when all of this'll arrive, SloClap made clear not to expect everything by the end of this year, so you may well have to be patient if you've got your eye on one of those non-crossplay additions.</p>
<p>If it helps, imagine the devs dribbling through a circuit of well-placed cones that each represent a development thing equal in threat to a six foot four centre back called big Terry whose mum they've just insulted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
