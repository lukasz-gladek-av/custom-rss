            <p>
I hope none of you are allergic to shellfish, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shrimp-game">Shrimp Game</a> is exactly what it sounds like: a game about shrimp! And yet that is a complete bastardisation of what it is, for you do not simply play as a shrimp, you are piloting a shrimp, or SHRIMP (Submersible Hydrodynamic Research Integrated Marine Platforms), and you must survive a hellish underwater landscape filled with sea creatures that strive to see your life ended and "Lovecraftian bosses."
</p>
<p>
There is a hint of games like Armored Core to be found here, more so in movement mechanics. You don't pick out parts for your shrimp, but you do pilot it as if it were a mech, zooming around the seascape, shooting at other fishes and the like with your abilities. These abilities are based on elements like fire and earth, or light and dark, and you can even mix and match them to a certain degree. You will also find, amazingly, that you can play the game's campaign in six-player co-op, or you can try out its PvP modes like "Shrimp Royale, Shrimp Tag, and Capture the Turtle!"
</p>
<p>
Shrimp Game currently has a demo on Steam that I spent a bit of time with after spotting it in The Virtual Moose's most recent <a href="https://virtualmoose.org/2025/11/08/indie-game-roundup-november-8-2025/">indie game round-up</a> - just in the campaign mode, though its online mode is available too - and it is as frenetic as it is wacky. Enemy attacks approach you at all angles, you need to be constantly aware of your surroundings otherwise you'll end up sleeping with the fishes, literally and figuratively.
</p>
<p>
Its world is tantalizingly weird and mysterious too, as silly as it might be to feel this way about something called Shrimp Game, I really vibed with its salty hellscape. I want to learn about why this world exists in the way it does. I want to understand why I have to pilot the shrimp.
</p>
<p>
When can I do this? Well, sometime in 2026, as it doesn't have a more specific release date beyond that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824880/SHRIMP_GAME/">wishlist the game on Steam</a> (and try out the demo) right now.

Do you think there are people out there that feel as passionately as sports fans do when someone gets added to their team that might make them better, but with video game developers? Probably not, or at least only on a personal level, but for that hypothetical group of people that exists, a new trade (is that how you refer to sports doers, I really don't know) has taken place between the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and CD Projekt Red.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced on his personal Bwitter account earlier today that "<a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342">Things are happening!</a>" those things being that he now works for CD Projekt Red as a senior quest designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-loss-is-the-witcher-4s-gain-as-cd-projekt-red-picks-up-the-lead-gameplay-designer-behind-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-action-rpg/">GamesRadar</a>). While I can't tell you the exact missions Kolmann worked on in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a handy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolmann/overlay/1738234374263/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAA-hQ1MBs2pvuw9SYLFGUiET729k6q5A4Fw">LinkedIn post</a> tells us that he designed and wrote 11 of them, and also designed the game's crime system alongside the stealth and perception systems of NPCs.
</p>
<p>
A clue into the kind of work he might be doing on The Witcher 4? Literally no way of knowing! But he does have some specific skills, so Ciri getting up to some stealthy stuff feels possible at least.
</p>
<p>
As it currently stands, we… don't actually know all that much about The Witcher 4. Here's some things we do know: it's "more console-first" though it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-console-first-development-still-push-pcs">still be able to melt your PC</a>, it'll be made in Unreal Engine 5 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">even got a fancy tech demo</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't be out before 2027</a>, and will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">apparently explore sexism more directly</a> with Ciri at the helm. Considering it only properly started development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">at the end of last year</a>, we're probably a ways out from getting any kind of gameplay trailer. I'm sure you can just play The Witcher 4 for the umpteenth time while you wait.

            <p>
I am sure that, if I were a porter of any kind in the material world, I would find an exoskeleton quite helpful. Probably, anyway, I might also be too afraid that one would crush my bones, or fuse to my body in a horrendous accident that results in the government stealing me away to send me on top secret missions thanks to my strong part-robot body. None of that happened when I used an exoskeleton in both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games, it was actually quite a useful thing to do. And now, apparently, I can try out what the experience of what using one is like, free of my silly little bits, with an - I kid you not - officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> exoskeleton.
</p>
<p>
I know, I know, that one isn't on PC yet! You and I both know it'll come this way eventually, and the first one is, and I just needed to write about this ridiculous piece of merchandise that surely spells out the death of capitalism, and so this is my justification, alright? Anyway! The <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2">official Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton</a> comes from a company called Dnsys which makes, well, exoskeletons.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>DNSYS ✖️ DEATH STRANDING 2 co-branded exoskeleton is here 👍</p><p>📦 Dnsys Z1 Exoskeleton Pro – DEATH STRANDING 2 ON THE BEACH Limited Edition<br>It enhances lower-body strength and stability, allowing humans to keep moving through complex terrain and extreme environments. 🦵🦿… <a href="https://t.co/Yi1E6RnKNC">pic.twitter.com/Yi1E6RnKNC</a></p></div>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
It is apparently made in collaboration with Kojima Productions, and specifically co-designed with art director Yoji Shinkawa. The store page for it notes that it is the "first collaboration between the game developer and the exoskeleton manufacturer," a point that I don't think needed pointing out at all, and also raises several questions we won't get into right now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what it actually does, it "extends hiking range by 15.5 miles, and vertical climbing by 9.3 miles," it offers 50% extra power to your steps (whatever that means) and knee pressure relief, can make you feel up to 44 pounds lighter, can adapt to all kinds of terrain, and lasts up to four hours of continuous use. Oh, and it has some fancy lights which look like the ones on the game's exoskeletons.
</p><p>
Right now there's no price attached to this thing, but I'm betting on it being expensive. A different model from the company that isn't themed after a video game (how boring, right?) will apparently cost $1500 when it launches, so you're looking at around that minimum, though likely more.
</p>
<p>
Truthfully, this just feels like the kind of thing a superfan would buy and perhaps use once for a Halloween costume only to put it back in its box and stuff it in the attic. I admit it does have a potentially useful purpose, that purpose just feels diminished by its luxury goods status. It just leaves me wondering where merchandise can go from here. Will Kojima try to flog an actual baby in a pod? Perhaps Labubu style in mystery boxes! I pray we never evolve into such a world.
