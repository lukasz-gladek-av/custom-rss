            <p>Capcom are fine-tuning the live service of livestock-murdering game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> by making the Arch-tempered monster hunts a permanent fixture, rather than time-limited seasonal content quests. It's a bid to address the FOMO element that has dragged the game down to an Overwhelmingly Negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam user review consensus</a>, though there are other things to blame for that, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">dodgy performance</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>One Arch-tempered munster, Rey Dau, will return on July 23rd, after the currently available event quest ends on July 16th. (If you're unfamiliar, Rey Dau is a big golden Tesla dragon.) Arch-tempered Uth Duna will debut on the same date, a week ahead of schedule. (If you've yet to have the pleasure, Uth Duna is a flouncy alligator that loves to sneeze on itself.)</p>
<p>These may not be the first permanently available Arch-tempered monsters. "We are considering making the event quests for the upcoming Arch-tempered monsters and other event quests permanently available as well," Capcom comment via <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1943582546886889868">MechaHitler.com</a>. More details are to follow.</p>
<p>Going by the responses to this announcement, I gather that the limited-time quests in Monster Hunter Wilds have been causing a lot of ruckus. Some players object that the previous major series iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak">Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</a>, did not have these stressful features, while others point out that they were present in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, the last game from the Wilds team specifically.</p>
<p>My only, rather disingenuous thought here is that it's a bit rich for so-called "hunters" to be complaining of FOMO. Hunting is supposed to be about identifying and accommodating the prey animal's schedule, isn't it? Pretty dang sure the pre-Neolithic tribes weren't out there review-bombing the skygods because the herds kept moving south for the winter. Actually, that probably explains the formation of many organised religions.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered just not telling people when Arch-tempered monsters are present in the game. Foster the element of curiosity! I'm sure that would in no way increase the quantity of hatemail they're receiving. Capcom have recently <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">put out a statement</a> addressing the harassment of staff, which has been widely interpreted as a response to the ruckus over Monster Hunter Wilds.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo]]></content:encoded>
