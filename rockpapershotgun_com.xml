            <p>Last week, Ubisoft canned the long-in-development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake amid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a> which have come to serve as the starting bell for a bunch of organisational changes that are currently crystalising into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">job cuts</a>. Now, actor Eman Ayaz has released a video in which she discusses having learned last week that three years worth of her work on an unnamed project had been tipped down the drain. </p>

<p>The video doesn't see Ayaz specify that the project she's talking about is the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the actor claiming early on that she's "still under NDA". According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-cancelation-actress-says-shes-lost-3-years-of-work-and-found-out-via-the-internet">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-was-devastating-prince-of-persia-remake-actor-found-out-the-game-was-cancelled-via-the-internet/">VGC</a>, Ayaz has seperately reposted some comments from fans which suggest the Sands of Time remake is the project she's referring to here.</p>
<p>"I've dedicated the last three years of my life to this project and spent those years getting to know the team, which has become like a family to me," Ayaz said. I've watched it grow through countless stages of development and I've waited and waited for the day that it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it. And this week I found out through the internet that the project has been cancelled."</p><p>According to the actor, she found out about the cancellation after her brother spotted an article about it. "I was just in total shock," she recalled. "Just last month or two months ago, I had filmed marketing for this project. Everything had been running smoothly and that was the last that I had heard and we were all really looking forward to it being released this year."</p>
<p>Ayaz claimed she turned down "other opportunities" while working on the project and opted to keep coming to work on it with a broken foot. Following the cancellation, the Canadian Pakistani actor has had to abandon plans to apply for a visa to work in the US and aim to land gigs there off the back of having the now-cancelled project on her resume.</p>
<p>In their statement about the Sands of Time remake's cancellation, Ubisoft wrote that "while the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit". The company also added that they "didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents".</p>
<p>"Sadly, the entertainment industry is not really just about entertainment," Ayaz said towards the end of her video. "It's about guaranteeing a cash flow. And that means making decisions that treat people's lives as collateral damage and art as disposable content. I'm not the only person that this decision affects, and it's a really sad thing to see the aversion to risk in the entertainment industry."</p>

            <p>Valve's lawyers won't be able to file away one of the legal legalings they've been dealing with for a little while now, at least not yet. A tribunal have ruled that the £656m lawsuit brought against the company by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt and law firm Milberg London LLP last year - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-owe-you-44-quid-according-to-a-656-lawsuit-against-the-company-for-allegedly-overcharging-uk-customers">the one</a> that could net UK dwellers who've bought stuff on Steam since early June 2018 up to £44 in compensation - can go ahead.</p>
<p>As a result, Valve's Lionel Hutzes will have to face the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">lawsuit's accusations</a> that the company have used Steam's "dominant position" in the PC market to behave "anti-competitively", with the end result that regular folks are "paying too much for PC games and in-game content and have lesser PC Game platform alternatives".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">BBC</a>, Valve had been arguing the case shouldn't get the stamp of approval to proceed to trial. However, a competition appeal tribunal have ruled that the case will be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">summary of the tribunal's judgement</a>, which begins by outlining three key cogs to Shotbolt's accusations. The lawsuit claims that Valve impose platform parity obligations with Steam that stop publishers from selling games on rival stores with better terms. It also accuses Valve of using anti-steering provisions to lock in-game purchases made in Steam games into using the storefront's "application programming interface", wich means payments are subject to Valve’s commission charges. Finally, the lawsuit claims Valve are "imposing excessive commission charges which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers".</p><p>Valve, meanwhile, argued at this tribunal that Shotbolt's lawsuit hadn't "put forward an adequate methodology for determining Valve’s effective commission charge" and failed to consider how Steam Keys factor in. The company also claimed the suit lacked "an adequate empirical method for determining the effect" of the alleged platform parity obligations. Valve also argued that the Shotbolt's lawsuit lacked a "workable methodology" that Steam users, including minors, could use to identify themselves as being part of the group being claimed on behalf of by the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Evaluating those three arguments from Valve, the tribunal "accepted that the effect of Steam Keys is a slightly unusual feature in calculating Valve’s effective commission charge and could result in uncertainty in the price alleged to be unfair", but judged that Shotbolt and co "would be able to make a sufficient estimate using data from a range of sources". As far as the platform parity obligations went, the tribunal ruled that the lawsuit "would not simply rely on nebulous economic theory, as claimed by Valve, but rather on a mixture of evidence to support and evaluate a harm that competition law conventionally considers to occur".</p>
<p>Last of all, the tribunal opted to reject Valve's challenge about the methods of identifying which Steam users were being claimed on behalf of. Though, this came after Shotbolt and co outlined "revisions to the proposed class definition", which "tied the class tightly to the party who has suffered the loss, reducing the potential concern of the record keeping of minors".</p>
<p>So, on rumbles the case, no doubt feeling refreshed by virtue of having had a room full of people in suits shout big words at each other in relation to it.</p>
