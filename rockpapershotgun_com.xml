            <p>While we're getting a Gears Of War prequel in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears Of War: E-Day</a>, this does mean that Gears Of War 6 is yet to be a thing. In a recent episode of IGN's Podcast Unlocked, former Gears Of War director and current Diablo 4 lead Rod Fergusson revealed what his plans were for Gears 6 when he left. In short, he was going to take the game to space. Righto.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When asked for his thoughts on Gears Of War going down the prequel route, Fergusson said that it was ultimately a "really smart" decision, despite not being in line with his original plans for Gears 6. He was then, of course, asked what those plans were.</p>

<p>"I was just getting us off Sera, so Gears 6 was to leave Sera," Fergusson said - Sera being the planet that Gears is set in, all Locusted up and very much in a bad spot. Following up on this, he talked about how the story would be centred around the Union of Independent Republics rocket technology glimpsed in Gears 5.</p><p>"We were sort of laying the seeds and the groundwork that in taking over that UIR territory, we've adopted their space program," Fergusson said. "So what I wanted to do with Gears 6 is take you off Sera to encounter what that could mean to the rest of the galaxy or, at least, the rest of the solar system. Not that you'd be hopping [between planets], but... it was old, Russian-era, sputnik-type tech, so we weren't going to start Mass Effect-ing this. It was really about, 'let's get you to a new place to encounter what this looks like.'"</p>
<p>While I do think the Gears story needs a shake up, I don't know if the above "we're shipping off elsewhere" approach would have tied things together well. If anything needs changing about Gears it's surely the characters. I wish the series would drop the dull JD Fenix and co, and give us a more interesting roster without leaving Sera. Maybe they're not even COGs. Maybe we lean heavily into the survival horror that the original did so well? There's so much more to mine in Sera, I think, before you start introducing aliens.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/twitch-introduces-mandatory-politics-and-sensitive-social-issues-label-just-in-time-for-the-us-election<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>It "could bring new advertisers to our service"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Twitch have <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">introduced</a> a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.</p>
<p>Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."</p> <!--more-->
<p>Streamers who fail to use the label appropriately will receive email warnings and eventually, have their accounts suspended. Twitch may also intervene to apply labels without the streamer's say-so.
</p>
<p>
The measures were <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">announced on 1st November</a>, and seem obviously timed to control the circulation of polemics during the US presidential elections on 5th November. The post above links to <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">a longer but far from complete breakdown of the new content category</a> - here are some examples of streams that will need the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label in future:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies
</p>
<p>
Live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes
</p>
<p>
Livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies
</p>
<p>
Discussing military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters
</p>
<p>
Discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion
</p>
<p>
Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As for what doesn't require a label, Twitch are fine with "streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate. For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote." They're also OK with "intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues".
</p><p>
As many Twitch users have <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1852370050335887512">pointed out on social media</a>, all these designations are quite blurry and therefore, <a href="https://x.com/MoonlightBVT/status/1852856903875100985">easy to twist and weaponise</a> against vulnerable groups. What does "intermittent" mean, exactly, as a proportion of total streaming time? Does "sharing knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner" become "advocacy" when the facts presented lead to certain conclusions? 
</p>
<p>
The ambiguity leaves the new category open to bad-faith reporting. The requirement to categorise "political" streams so people and advertisers can avoid them might also have a chilling effect on discussion of political narratives and themes in video games. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, for example, makes diversity a cornerstone of its writing, but a streamer discussing that would presumably risk having their streams labelled political and so, losing access to a chunk of potential viewers and ad revenue.
