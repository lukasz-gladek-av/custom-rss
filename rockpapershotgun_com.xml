            <p>Attention, folks who like the idea of flinging a fire-breathing Group B monster down some dirt tracks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> devs Kunos are bringing out a rally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. It's called Assetto Corsa Rally, therefore instantly winning the inventive video game name award for this year.</p>
<p>As with road racing AC successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-evo-motors-into-multiplayer-racing-for-the-first-time-in-its-latest-early-access-update">Assetto Corsa EVO</a>, the studio and co-developers Supernova Games Studios have opted to go the Steam early access route for this selection of Scandinavian flicks, with a release penned in for November November 13 this year.</p>

<p>"Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts," Supernova studio director Mauro Notarberardino said in the game's <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/assetto-corsa-rally-wishlist-now-on-steam/">announcement post</a>. "A special thanks goes to Kunos Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series — especially in terms of the driving model — in this new chapter."</p><p>I can't help but read that first bit as pointing straight to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">EA "pausing" development on future rally sims</a> at Codemasters earlier this year, leaving a DIRTy great Colin McRae-adjacent gap in the market the studio had regularly filled for 25 years or so. Naturally, as Brendy pointed out at the time, there are plenty of other great rally games out there to help fill the hole, but few offer the kind of in-depth realism of a cutting-edge sim.</p>
<p>As for what Assetto Corsa Rally will offer, Kunos and Supernova promise laser-scanned stages faithfully mirroring real life counterparts, the use of Assetto Corsa's physics engine to render everything from surfaces to weather, and cars ranging from 60s and 70s classics to modern trail blazers. At early access launch, there'll be ten rides including the likes of the Lancia Stratos and Rally2 class Hyundai i20N. The screenshots also include a Group B Lancia 037, a Seb Loeby early 2000s Citroen Xsara, and a 90s Delta. Stages on Welsh gravel and French tarmac will be on offer out of the gate.</p>
<p>By the time of full release, which the Steam page outlines is aiming to come in "less than 18 months", the studios' goal is to have five different rallies and a roster of over 30 cars up and running. The likes of a driving school and career mode are also planned. As a number of players have <a href="https://x.com/AC_assettocorsa/status/1979095945531797808">pointed out</a> in response to the announcement, it's a lot to take on while Kunos still have Assetto Corsa EVO in paid early access and in need of more additions before its 1.0 release. That said, the fact AC Rally's being co-developed is enough for me not to be too concerned, at least at this point.</p>
<p>You can wishlist Assetto Corsa Rally via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Steam page</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
