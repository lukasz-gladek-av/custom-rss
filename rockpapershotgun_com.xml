            <p>If you're partial to a bit of sticking a thing on top of another thing, then having little people live in those things while you lord over them as an omnipotent and potentially wrathful god that's busy listening to yoga class music, pay attention. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pile-up">Pile Up!</a>, which is about strategically building cities on little islands, has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094910/Pile_Up/">emerged from early access</a> and gotten a bunch of new additions.</p>
<p>One of these fresh things comes with an insistence from Turkish developers Remoob that you "try fearmongering". Bold of them to assume I'm not already covertly steering the world around me towards a state of rabid paranoia.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The devs kicked off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2094910/view/496076123863515253?l=english">patch notes</a> for Pile Up! by giving themselves a "great" rating in terms of how they handled its two year-long early access period, during which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-micro-citybuilder-is-a-high-rise-delight">our Katharine dived in</a> and found the game to be more up her alley than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a>.</p>
<p>Then, they get into the new stuff. A fresh mechanic's been added to the houses you place on your little island, meaning that if you stick one "directly in the middle of different buildings", it'll gain more population. The devs say this is inspired by a certain game they won't name, and I'm drawing a blank, so I'm just gonna assume it's somehow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p>

<p>Then, we get to the fearmongering. Remoob have added in three new types of building to increase the combos and strategies on offer in your stacking. Utopia buildings will help keep your people happy, Fundamentals can help drive a baby boom, but if you want to "destroy your buildings to panic people and win", the devs are clear. Try fearmongering. Do it.</p>
<p>Whether you've used the new islands the update also adds to Pile Up! in order to build your city on an unstable ruin, over a constantly travelling whale or at a very high altitude, it doesn't matter, you've got to try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Ditto if you're trying the new passive upgrades, playing through the new missions to pile up more lore knowledge, or hopping into the reworked chill mode which eliminates the need to care about buildings with different mechanics. Try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Remoob say they plan to keep on updating the game going forwards, and will have more info on that soon. In the interim, why not try fearmongering?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chill-micro-citybuilder-pile-up-just-emerged-from-early-access-and-its-devs-want-you-to-try-fearmongering]]></content:encoded>
