            <p>Gah! I've lost them again. My precious brows and burns, they've gone walkabouts! Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> latest patch aims to take care of instances of misbehaving hair. That's far from the only fix in what's a very beefy list, with companion buffs, crash corrections, and instances of weird NPC antics also having been tended to. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The near 5000 words of bullet points which make up Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-patch-1050">patch 1.0.5.0</a> make for surprisingly fun reading, with as many fun bugs having been squashed by Obsidian as serious issues. "The player's eyebrows no longer disappear when using the inventory screen or idle camera," was the first note which caught my eye, followed by: "The player's eyebrow color will now be properly saved and applied to their in-game characters after character creation. Note: this unfortunately will not retroactively fix incorrect eyebrow color for existing characters."</p>
<p>Tragedy. Pour one out for all the space adventurers who're stuck explaining why the brows don't match their blonde, brown, or black barnet until the end of time. The hair-raising fixes don't end there. Obsidian have "made adjustments to side burn facial hair so that it no longer disappears at certain angles". Great relief for those roleplaying as American civil war generals or Victorian businessmen.</p>
<p>Getting serious for a moment before I shout out a bunch more wacky ones, Obsidian have fixed a couple of issues which could prevent saving and generally "increased Companion survivability", meaning that they should be more effective especially on harder difficulties and if your leadership skill's high. A number of crashes and scenarios that could see NPCs get stuck have had failsafes put in, while characters should "no longer unexpectedly take explosive damage through walls or objects". Companions should now properly follow you through vents and not get stuck wanting to talk to you when they've got nothing new to say. The studio have also nixed some references to cut content which were causing errors.</p>
<p>Right, more silliness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the Order of the Ascendants members were found to be having conversations with each other at very long distances on Cloister, this wasn't part of the grand equation and has been addressed</li>
<li>Preventing your VALERIE unit from 'beep bop booping' into Ladders if you have climbed it</li>
<li>Player arm doesn't freak out anymore after sliding into a forced cinematic or conversation</li>
<li>Marisol is no longer able to teleport to the rooftop of Scientician's Surplus and enter a problematic state</li>
<li>Characters will no longer make noises before they have been spawned into an encounter</li>
<li>Player can no longer sprint while being mentally refreshed</li>
<li>Glued shoulder pads back onto our 2-handed handgun users so they no longer fly</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice.

            <p>
A mouse cannot live on adorable visual aesthetics alone, but Winter Burrow is definitely handsome enough to get me through to lunchtime. In this just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> from Danish developers Pine Creek Games, you play a rodent who has returned from the Rodent Big City to fix up their old treestump home.</p>
<p>It's something of a tragedy: your parents died in Rodent Big City, after working themselves to toothpicks, and your aunt has now gone missing. But the hand-illustrated 2D art style immediately lifts the mood. Look at your cutaway living room, with its cheerfully blazing fireplace! Look at those creamy hummocks of snow! Look at your frosty carcass being devoured by a spider! 
</p>
<p>
I feel like the winningly tatty Hundred Acre ambience might be at odds with the survival game premise, past a certain point, but the developers do note that Winter Burrow is based on "a dream of being able to play a survival game that was more forgiving than the genre usually is, but where there was still challenge and depth." They also observe that "the setting is inspired by books like 'The Wind in the Willows', the comic 'Mouse Guard' and the animated TV-series 'Over the Garden Wall'."</p>
<p>Personally, my mind flew to the Deptford Mice novels of Robin Jarvis, and especially The Crystal Prison, in which mice battle spectres in a cornfield. Those books are pretty grisly but they at least don't have any mouse-eating spiders, that I can remember. Also, there's a setting for turning the spiders off in Winter Burrow.
</p><p>
I've had a quick play of the demo, and it seems to hang together well enough as a survival game. The thrill of it right now is mostly unlocking rustic art assets, but it seems sturdily made for a survive 'em up, with a digestible UI and simple controls.</p>
<p>There are some congenial flourishes that bring warmth to the familiar business of stuffing sticks and stones into item recipes - for example, you'll knit new clothes in your plump and patchy armchair, rather than hammering out new socks and jerkins in a forge, as is often the case in less sentimental and internally consistent survival games. You can also make friends with neighbours while searching for your lost aunt, and there's talk of baking pies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">Read more on Steam</a>. If you prefer your mice to be mildly rotten and capable of hacking badgers to death, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-souls-meets-ocarina-of-time-in-mouseward-a-back-to-basics-soulslike-collectathon-with-sweet-n64-visuals">Mouseward</a> instead.

            <p>Yep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are definitely planning to release some DLC for the action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-planned-to-drop-by-march-next-year-fromsoftwares-big-corporate-bosses-reveal">by March 2026</a>. A DLC dubbed The Forsaken Hollows was revealed at last night's PlayStation State of Play, and is set to drop on December 4th.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation blog</a> about the DLC speaks of the "Great Hollow", a big hole that's opened up in the depths of Limveld, shifting the earth. It's filled with ancient ruins, life-sapping crystals, and also lots of things that want to take your lunch money.</p>
<p>Venturing forth as your tried and tested Nightfarer or one of the two new ones added by the DLC, you'll come face to face with bosses like Shadow of the Erdtree's Dancing Lion and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>' abyss-battling knight Artorias. Don't worry, I'm sure they won't be too tough, especially if you accept those fresh shoes and take them on as the Scholar, a nerdy Nightfarer with big book smarts, or the Undertaker, an abbess with lots of strength, faith, and presumably the ability to immediately reassure anyone she says "my condolences" to.</p><p>As for how it'll all fit in lore-wise, FromSoft had the following to say: "In our war against the Night, every battle left a scar. These wounds were given will. A foul life, born of cast-away souls. Steel your resolve, Nightfarers. This hunt must be seen to its end." There's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988380951978861023">also chatter</a> about someone called "the Dreglord" and how they must be sliced, spelled or smacked out of existence in this tale of post-night battling. Odds are they're the weird thing which roars near the end of the trailer, with the studio being quite coy about both them and the gang of angelic fighters pictured in the new threats section of the PS blog.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you waltz over to your old buddy Artorias on December 4th, he'll be happy to give you the rundown.</p>
