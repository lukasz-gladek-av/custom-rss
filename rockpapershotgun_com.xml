            <p>Gerry from the River rides up to a noticeboard for the second time this week. Between contracts, he scans the pinned scraps for a fresh job to take on, only for his eyes to rest on another particularly peculiar bit of prose. 'There's a mysterious extra DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> in the works', this bit of paper claims. 'Oh yeah, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-reporting-winds-continue-to-howl-of-mysterious-extra-dlc-allegedly-arriving-this-year-and-theres-one-thing-id-love-to-see-it-do">I heard about that</a>,' Gerry's brain responds. 'Also, it reportedly might be set in Zerrikania,' says the paper. 'Ooh, that's new,' the Witcherman's noggin thinks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The bit of paper, this time symbolising reporting from <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">Ian Games Network Poland</a>, explains that it's heard CD Projekt's developers have previously been interested in exploring Zerrikania. For those who've not stuck their heads deep into the big bucket of witchery lore, that's a region located to the east of the locations throughout The Continent which have served as settings for Witcher games to this point.</p>
<p>If my memory serves correctly, the province has thus far been mentioned as an exotic locale of rainforests, deserts and steppes, ruled by a dragon-worshipping matriarchal society taking cues from the likes of ancient Scythia or Africa. So, a big change of pace from the generally medieval European-inspired climes Geralt's typically seen roaming. One of the bits of the Witcher books which has stuck with me in the long-term is a short story from Sword of Destiny in which Gerry meets a knight called Borch Three Jackdaws, who's accompanied by a pair of female Zerrikanian warriors called Téa and Véa, which has since featured in the Witcher Netflix series. I'll not spoil it here, but there are some dragon-hunting shenanigans.</p>
<p>While IGN Poland's bit of paper makes clear the info it's reporting now dates back several years, with the other recent reporting hinting at an extra Witcher 3 DLC being the reason it's being revisited now, if even a short trip to Zerrikania does turn out to be on the cards, I'd be up for it. I've generally been sceptical of what purpose this alleged extra might serve once the initial excitement at having more of a good game subsides, but offering a first taste of a place in the series' universe folks usually only hear whispers about or seen card art of would fill that blank.</p>
<p>I still struggle to see such a thing being pulled of in anywhere near as expansive fashion as the game-sized Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine DLCs, but much more contained add-ons can always be plenty of fun.</p>
<p>Or they could just stick to my previously outlined wish and put out a DLC in which Geralt becomes a goofy centaur. Oop, speaking of Gerry, he's galloped away from the noticeboard in a huff again.</p>

            <p>Microlandia deserves a much longer article, preferably written by our resident virtual metropolis judger Sin Vega. For the moment, I will only say that it’s a work-in-progress city-builder fuelled by a poetical mixture of admiration and terror for cities. </p><!--more-->
<p>This is the impression given by the developer’s changelogs, anyway. Here, for example, is <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1309434/microlandia-14-the-money-edition">how they describe</a> Microlandia update 1.4 on Itch.io, which makes adjustments to the game’s economy, company management and public transport simulation: “A city is a beautiful, but insane machine that survives always in homeostasis and always in chaos. In 1.4 you get a little less narrative, a little more reality, the structures of everyday life exposed, greed companies, economy that doesn't forgive, even the broke. The night mode is a pleasant anesthesia; use it, but do not confuse ambience with robustness.”</p>
<p>I will try not to, Information Superhighway Games. I will try not to confuse ambience with robustness.</p>

<p>Microlandia hit 1.0 release over December, so yes, we are playing Jenny Catch-Up here. In general, it looks to deliver a “brutally honest” rendition of city life and management. It executes the chemistry and causality of the urban human experience with chilly exactitude. Citizens are capable of falling not just into, but out of love. Imagine that. Imagine making it possible for your pops to undergo heartbreak. They also risk being fired if they show up late for work, perhaps because you've screwed up the bus timetables, and if they can’t find a job, they’ll turn to crime. </p><p>The mechanics go beyond pegging out residences, workplaces and leisure facilities while staying in budget. This is a mean town indeed. Landlords are greedy and will raise the rent when accommodation is scarce. Rich folk will embrace their opportunities without qualm: as an older Itch.io update <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1131465/microlandia-10-the-city-shaken-awake">explains</a>, “high-net-worth citizens will rent only low-density housing, and along with the upper class get NIMBY vibes and avoid buildings with disapproval aura.”</p>
<p>You’ll have to worry about pandemics, heatwaves, and compensating people for rezoning. There’s a local newspaper that tracks your decisions and does not spare the lash; if you reap some bad headlines, your budget may be reduced.</p>
<p>As developer explodi <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1029279/welcome-to-microlandia-the-brutally-honest-city-builder">explains in last year’s announcement post</a>, Microlandia is both a homage to and a critique of the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. “I always wondered what will happen in simcity if citizens live or die because of the many real reasons that determine the length of our lives here on earth,” they write. “Life expectancy, accidents, bad health system, or the lack of access to it. This statistics exist [sic], and we can use the power of new technology [to] create more realistic simulations.” </p>
<p>The game’s mechanics draw on study of research shared by the World Bank, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Equity Atlas and the Center for Urban Future, among others. They’re keeping track of all these sources in a colossal <a href="https://microlandia.city/simulation_parameters">live document</a>, auto-generated from the game’s code. If you’re proper nerdy about this stuff, I imagine you will have Opinions on the facts and figures therein. Do tell. You can also find Microlandia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4094120/Microlandia/">Steam</a>.</p>
