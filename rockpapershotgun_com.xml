            <p>
Cooking is a thing I think about almost on a daily basis, not because of the usual pesky reason that is my mortal coil demanding sustenance, but because I love to do it! Having a family background in hospitality will do that to you. Of course, doing this whole writing about games thingy is a bit of a different beast, but cooking does still often crop up in games. My only problem is I often wish it was a central aspect of a game, rather than a singular, miniscule feature. Lucky for me, a new restaurant management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-hearth-and-harbour">The Hearth and Harbour</a> from the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pale-beyond">The Pale Beyond</a> has just been announced!
</p>
<p>
In The Hearth and Harbour, you play as Kit, who's left their home behind in hopes of finding a new life, all while trying to avoid a war that's on the way. Kit ends up in a harbour city called Lewthport, acquiring a rundown restaurant to restore - though this does require paying off a substantial loan. That's where you come in! It's up to you to decide what kind of establishment this becomes, like a greasy spoon, a fancy bistro, or something a bit gourmet.

<p>
What this means in practical terms is choosing the layout and decor in the first instance, and once you're up and running, The Hearth and Harbour turns into a turn-based tactical game where you have to seat customers, take orders, and make sure food arrives in good time. Happier customers, more money.
</p><p>
Outside of working hours, you're able to wander around Lewthport. There's a market to pick up ingredients from, you can build relationships with your suppliers, maybe head to the pub for a pint. There's an opportunity to build a community here, and subsequently that affects how successful your restaurant ends up. You have to make important narrative choices through conversations too, it all seems quite neatly complex.
</p>
<p>
Not only is it made by The Pale Beyond developer Saltstore Studios, but The Hearth and Harbour is set in the same world and time period as the survival game. There's no release date just yet, but you can count me in on keeping an eye on this one. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2528170/The_Hearth_and_Harbour/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <p>
It is always an exciting time when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are up to something. The sheer variety they've put on display with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a> is nothing to sniff at. Now, it appears they're gearing up for the next project in an appropriately mysterious way. Earlier today, the official Red Candle Games YouTube channel shared a video titled "The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe," and it certainly isâ€¦ something.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is done in one of those creepypasta kinda video essays, the kind where the voice over has either been pitched down, or performed by a robot, or both. And it's all a bit, well, for lack of a better word, creepy. It opens up with the line "are you really human?" which is a question I thought only Yoko Taro was allowed to ask in video games, but nevertheless, an off putting way to start things.

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ynAl_k7AkVM?autoplay=1" title="The Dark Legacy of the Sun Tribe">

<p>
What proceeds is something that sounds like a conspiracy narrated by someone called Yuuki about human evolution, and that aforementioned dark legacy of the sun tribe. A tale is spun about an ancient bamboo scroll written in a language never seen before, a real Chinese alchemist named Xu Fu who sought after immortality by venturing to a place called Penglai, and a civilian scholar desperate to learn more.
</p><p>
A couple things worth noting here: the beginning of the video talks about people born with four fingers. Yi, the protagonist of Nine Sols, is a member of a race called the Solarians, who all have four fingers. Solarian obviously stems from solar, much like the sun tribe mentioned in this teaser. Immortality also comes up in Nine Sols, and Penglai is the name of the planet that Solarians are from. So, I don't know about you, but this sure does seem like something Nine Sols is on the way.
</p>
<p>
A sequel? DLC? Something else entirely? It's possible, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-pleasant-surprise-the-gorgeous-sekiro-like-metroidvania-nine-sols-has-a-prequel-manga">get a prequel manga earlier this year</a>. For now, we'll just have to let the conspiracy unravel itselfâ€¦

            <p>
It's that time of year, where the weather starts to get a bit chillier, cafes start to reintroduce seasonally appropriate hot beverages, and of course, the arrival of a new Football Manager is in sight. Sports Interactive announced the release date for this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 2026</a>, earlier today, which you may be pleased to hear is only a couple of months away: November 4th.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot of firsts with this year's version of the digital beautiful game. For one, it's been made in Unity for the first time, a fact that I'm sure at least one of you will bring up if this one ends up being a bit rubbish despite likely having nothing to do with what engine it was made in.
</p>
<p>
The bigger, and more exciting new thing is the introduction of Women's Football. While this should have been introduced years ago (can't have been that hard, can it Sports Interactive?), as the old saying goes, better later than never. A press release says Women's Football has been "seamlessly integrated into the FM ecosystem as one footballing world" and that its arrival is "backed by the most comprehensive database of its kind and a host of licensed competitions set to be revealed in the coming weeks."
</p>
<p>
With this entry of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim you'll also find the debut of the Premier League, complete with licensed club badges, kits, and player photos. On top of that, Football Manager 2026 has a "re-imagined" user interface that should give you a bit more control moment to moment. It's also meant to be just generally more intuitive, for both newbies and those who've been playing for a while.
</p>
<p>
Football Manager 2026 arrives on November 4th, later this year.
