            <p>Waiting's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">a bit of theme</a> during the early stages of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta, which has otherwise been earning a lot of thumbs up from FPS heads. If you've recently run into an never-ending loading screen while trying to jump into a Conquest match, the good news is that the devs have been working to solve those issues.</p>
<p>While EA reckon the problem's specific to that game mode and the Siege of Cairo map, that doesn't look to have stopped plenty of players from running into it over the past 24 hours. Cue a number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mkcz0j/infinite_loading_screen_glitch_in_beta/">frustrated</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mko40z/bug_as_of_this_morning_i_cant_get_into_a_game/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mklzer/need_infinite_loading_screen_fix_asap/">posts</a> that boil down to the word 'stuck' being yelled so loud it could bring down a helicopter.</p>

<p>"Our team has been investigating reports of an infinite loading screen sometimes occurring when matchmaking into Siege of Cairo while playing Conquest," the official Battlefield Comms account tweeted this morning. "We've identified the cause and are performing server restarts to resolve this. These restarts will not affect players currently in-match. Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>While waiting for EA to address the issue, folks had been trying stuff like verifying the game's files on Steam or restarting it to solve their problems.</p> <div>

<p>With those server restarts, hopefully Cairo conquesters'll no longer keep getting stuck staring at some soldiers' shapely posteriors in perma-load, and be back to staring at a soldier's shapely posterior because they've decided to use someone else as cover mid-match. It's a strategy. A crap one, but hey, some of us aren't blessed with Alexander the Great's tactical nous.</p>
<p>For those waiting until this weekend to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-early-access">jump into the Battlefield beta</a>, first of all congrats on likely missing the longest queues. Second, you'll need <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">turn on secure boot on your PC</a> if you've not done so already.</p>
<p>Also, EA have posted a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953500544162500657">lengthy list of known issues</a> they'll be updating as they keep firing RPGs at bugs and issues throughout the beta, so maybe give that look too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-beta-been-treating-you-to-infinite-loading-screens-ea-are-on-the-case]]></content:encoded>
