            <p>Please excuse the eyeball jelly. I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindwave">Mindwave</a>'s minigame barrage. The current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741670/MINDWAVE_Demo/">Steam demo</a> is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy". It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:</p>

<p>It's set in a "cognitive reality game" tournament, and your role as Pandora is to play frenetic rounds of minigames - most last just a few seconds before jumping to the next - in between chatting to the other contestants. "MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP OF MINDSCAPE TOWER. DELVE INTO THE MINDS OF YOUR OPPONENTS. BE CONSUMED BY THE TRUTH THEY SPEAK TO YOU, IN THIS CEREBRAL BATTLE OF SIGHT AND SOUND HIDDEN WITHIN EACH OF US", reads the Steam page. I'd usually reformat the caps there but honestly, Mindwave earns it caps.</p>
<p>In the short time I've played, I have: won a pistol duel to the death, fed some Tamagotchi-like creatures, caught a cat, brushed some hair, popped bubblewrap, spammed some typing, and several other things that went by too fast for me to remember. It's all very twee but quietly insidious at the same time.</p><p>It looks to have taken off in a big way already. The game is currently raising funds for a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/holohammer/mindwave">full release on Kickstarter</a>, but development team HoloHammer's socials are already brimming <a href="https://x.com/holohammer_">with fanart</a>. Members of the team have previously worked on several smaller games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618580/Run_Doodleguy/">Run, Doodleguy!</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/P_s9pjiB7qY">INSOMNIARY</a>, but say this is their biggest project yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JwFiIUAa5Jg">Dorkus64's soundtrack</a> is a real highlight here, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> a pleasing word to say? <em>Straftat</em>. It almost demands an angry bark, an accusatory finger. <em><strong>Straftat!</strong></em> The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">our favourite games of last year</a>, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> appears among them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Included in the update you'll find 15 maps named some variation of "TheSamePlace". If you know your Counter-Strike history you will recognise the layout of fy_iceworld. A simple boxy set of corridors with a few waist-high cover spots, and a cramped central buy zone where you will certainly perish. The image above is Counter-Strike's Iceworld, I should clarify, not the one in Straftat. That, you can see in the pics below.</p>

<p>Iceworld was a love-or-hate arena that was beautiful, panicky, and funny in its abstract simplicity. If there's a game where this map belongs in 2025, it is undoubtedly Straftat. Yes, some existing arenas in the shooter already feel a lot like Iceworld. But this is a truly unfettered reproduction. And there are a bunch of other variations on the same layout.</p><p>There's at least one other fun homage too. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>'s <a href="https://unreal.fandom.com/wiki/DM-MorbiasII">DM_Morbias</a> also makes an appearance, with its panopticon-like lobby inviting all into the embrace of death (did you know you can now also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-unreal-and-unreal-tournament-are-now-free-and-preserved-on-the-internet-archive">get Unreal Tournament for free</a> too?). There might be other mappy tributes in the big expandopack, but my arena shooter history fails me at this point. </p>

<p>The update also adds nine new weapons, including a katana and the Hill H15, an unusual prototype submachine gun from the 1950s that had a transparent magazine on the top. You can now also play a tutorial level, and set all the "active" maps you want into a playlist for more customised multiplayer shenanigans. All these additions and more are detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/764023363746136681">an update post</a> by developers Lemaitre Bros.</p>
<p>Straftat launched with 70 maps - but you could buy a DLC pack that added 70 more. With this update an extra three DLC maps have been added to that buyable expansion pack. And another seven maps got quietly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/2386720/announcements/detail/4453592738017837305?snr=2___">added back in November</a>. All this brings the total number of murder playgrounds to a vertigo-inducing 180. Probably more if I've missed a few "alt maps". That is wonderful. A playlist of death zones on shuffle. Or as our reviewer Rick Lane put it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">"an anarchic first-person speed dater"</a>. </p><p>As for Iceworld specifically, level designer Robert Yang once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">wrote a piece for us about the fan-made map's legacy</a>, comparing it to "the last desperate fight in the final circle of a battle royale, over and over". He even went in search of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-made-fy_iceworld-a-forensic-investigation">the map's original author</a>. If you're at all into mapping or just want to indulge in some multiplayer nostalgia, it's a good read. <strong><em>STRAFTAT!</em></strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
