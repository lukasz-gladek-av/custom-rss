Before you jeer at my beautiful baby boy the Tantus Tsunami, know that he has an Impact rating and a Stiffness of 3 stars. If somebody belts you with the Tantus Tsunami, you're going down like a sack of potatoes. The trade-off is that he has a balance rating of 22%. Best not wave him over your head, or you might glitch out. Also, that's not a smiley face, it's a deathshead. Ah, many are those who have trembled in the glare of the Tantus Tsunami (don't google it).

If you think this is preposterous, check out the tinfoil bullshit artistry the playtesters are smashing together on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesong/">subreddit</a>. One of their swords looks like a graphics card advert from 1997. Somebody else has made a trowel. Such nonsense. No videogame would ever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shovel-knight">feature a trowel as a weapon</a> and I certainly can't think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWpCag9R9U">any parallels in film</a>, either.

This is Bladesong - or Trowelsong, or Lightsabersong, or Treewandsong, or whatever else occurs the next time you're afflicted by a strange mood and confine yourself to a workshop. It's a blacksmith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you play the chief swordwhisperer of Eren Keep - the last stronghold in a ravaged world, where humans yet cling onto some society beneath the rule of the tyrannous, messianic Masked King. Over the course of the game, you'll take on commissions from mercs and bluebloods, hire storied characters to work around the forge, enmesh yourself with factions of scholars and scavengers, and investigate the mystery of the Masked King himself. 
</p><p>
Given how prone RPGs are to showering you in weapons, I do like the idea of playing the person who crafted them. That might be just another +3 bronze scimitar with a plain square guard to <em>you</em>, chum, but it was my first commission after completing my apprenticeship. That +3 bronze scimitar paid for the anvil I'm using to forge you this +5 steel claymore with a wire grip and light-up pommel. Which you are going to discard in five minutes time because you found a +6 steel claymore under a bridge. Don't apologise. I'm used to it. All part of the trade.
</p>
<p>
As I wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-bladesong-you-are-both-the-real-hero-and-villain-of-any-fantasy-rpg-the-person-who-makes-all-the-swords">our first article about Bladesong</a>, I'm interested to know how much the design and quality of your work affects quest outcomes. I'd like to be able to indirectly assassinate people I hate by serving them really shit swords. Let's face it, simply wearing the Tantus Tsunami on your belt will probably reduce you to a quivering wreck (don't google it).</p>
<p>These are questions for the full game. Right now we have a demo with a Creative Mode, and the first thing to do in any Creative Mode demo is slam all the sliders in different directions, then hoot and holler outta the building. OK, a few of the playtesters and demo downloaders are taking things more seriously. I think the below look quite plausible, for instance.

<p>Can you do better? I'm sure you can do worse. Find Bladesong on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">Steam</a>. The finished game launches sometime this year.</p>
