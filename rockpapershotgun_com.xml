            <p>Open that bottle of space champagne, the aliens have been wiped out. At least that's what the interstellar pilots of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4476110736154691200">landed in the Sol system</a>, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called "Cocijo". Don't worry, they got him.</p>

<p>"The war is over," say Frontier. "We vanquished the enemy at our doorstep and now is the time to rebuild." Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_OZXIEcq9Q">a recording of the Titan finally being blown to bits</a>, courtesy of player Ricardo, who recorded the final event while sitting in his ship watching the ET's last moments. Titans are the biggest alien vessel in the game, massive capital ships certainly capable of eating a planet or two. When they were first discovered, hiding in the maelstrom clouds after a game update, they were found to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-going-to-like-whats-inside-elite-dangerous-thargoid-maelstrom-clouds">scary and noisy</a>. "Like an orchestra of alien tubas gargling mouthwash," said Katharine. </p>
<p>The asplosion comes just two weeks after the ships <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/galnet/titan-cocijo-devastates-sol-system">showed up in Sol</a>, on December 5th. Titans are fought by bombing them to kingdom come. This means earth defenders had to load out their ships with some swish sci-fi gear. They needed "caustic sinks" to negate the hull-eating effects of a cloud of horrible space gas the alien exudes. They had to fit a "pulse neutraliser" to nullify the angry waves of painful gravity the aliens pump out. And they required rack after rack of missiles to rain down upon the monster when they finally did manage to get close, aiming (like all good trench runs) for the thermal vents on the alien's hull. All this while avoiding Thargoid interceptor ships, dodging the mines laid in the hideous caustic cloud, and escaping from a burst of blue energy the Titan unleashes when it feels most vulnerable.</p><p>Say what you like about the dry space trucking of the sim, this is excellent sci-fi craic. Few video games can result in video guides as <a href="https://youtu.be/h0U5PTVMlGA?feature=shared&amp;t=490">satisfyingly dambusters as this</a>. Veteran players may also notice in that linked video that the pilot is sitting there with his engine idling at a low heat. That's because Commanders <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/359320/discussions/0/595135660380133228/">were advised</a> to keep their thermal levels low if they wanted to watch the fireworks - so they wouldn't be noticed by any of the Titan's last protective fighter vessels. A successful bombing run netted players millions of credits in payment for an alien well-whacked. And now that the Titan lies in pieces, even pilots who avoid combat can go and scavenge the wreckage for Thargoid components worth a few hundred thousand credits. </p>
<p>Developers Frontier have also celebrated the victory with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/508441373248061525">a post on Steam</a>, calling it an "epilogue" to the Thargoid saga. But they haven't said what's next for the aliens. Does this mean we won't see any more Titans appearing in the galaxy? Or does it just mean the threat to Earth is over? Smaller Thargoid vessels are still around to mop up, it seems, and we're not told yet if they're planning to remove those or leave them around. </p>
<p>The Thargoids have had a fun history in the game when you pile it all up. The possibility of alien life beyond bacteria was first teased in early 2016 when players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-aliens-barnacles">strange barnacles</a> on the surface of planets. Players soon started to discover <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-threat-teased-in-elite-dangerous-distress-calls">spooky distress signals</a> hinting at further dangers from beyond known space. "Oh my gods, it can't be," read one of the ill-fated messages. "These things are a myth... That noise..." Soon enough players found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-pilots-finally-find-a-crashed-alien-spaceship">crashed remains</a> of extraterrestrials. Then pilots started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-thargoid-encounter">pulled out of warp</a> by huge Thargoid scout ships, who would disable their vessel, scan them with sinister intent, and warp away. </p>
<p>Eventually, the aliens attacked. Almost two years after the first signs of aggressive alien life appeared, an update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-alien-swarm-thargoids">brought combat encounters</a> with the Thargoids to the sim. They've been around in some form or another ever since, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elite-dangerous-just-got-invaded-by-thargoids">amping up their attacks on human space</a> significantly in 2022. Now, this seems to be putting a bookend on the aliens as the big bad guy.</p><p>Elite Dangerous itself is ten years old this year, which does make me curious about what's next on the agenda. Other games might have seen a sequel by now, but I'm not sure what a sequel would achieve that more expansions and continued support could not. I guess we'll see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both "shifting market trends" - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for "narrative-driven, story-rich games" - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in an <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8">investor release this week</a>, the cancelled game was known as Project 8 internally, and had 37 team members as of September 2024. For context, 11 bit studios currently have over 150 staff, according to their <a href="https://11bitstudios.recruitee.com/">recruitment site</a>. It began development in early 2018, with total development costs of about 48.4 million zloties  - around 9.4 million pounds or 11.8 million dollars - by this September.
</p>
<p>
"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting," 11 bit's president of the management board Przemysław Marszał observes in a release. "However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal."
</p>
<p>
Gloominess about the layoffs aside, I'm predictably both intrigued and worried that 11 bit think there's less interest now in games with a pronounced narrative component. Then again, the reasons for the cancellation aren't all macroeconomical. "With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks," Marszał went on. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued.
</p>
<p>
"While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations," he said. "Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew."
</p>
<p>
During the unannounced game's last project milestone review, Marszał explained, "our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project's overall profitability."
</p><p>
It's not yet clear how many people will be laid off thanks to the cancellation, as it'll be a "phased" reduction. Marszał did specify that "more than half" of the Project 8 team will "be offered opportunities to transition to other existing teams or to new, as-yet-unannounced initiatives". 
</p>
<p>
I wasn't aware 11 bit were working on a console-focussed game. Their recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enthused many reviewers, though our own Sin Vega was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">pretty mixed on it</a>, and her conclusions chime with my misgivings at the preview stage.</p>
<p>I'm also not entirely sure what to make of next year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, a fancy sci-fi yarn in which you play a castaway who clones himself in order to operate a rolling space base, and then has to deal with his proportionately-multiplied psychological baggage. I think it'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">memorable</a>, whatever happens. In-house projects aside, 11 bit have also published some wonderful third-party creations, including acerbic religious fable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> and fantasy reshelving sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'd have been interested to see Project 8, assuming it also shipped on PC. Best of luck to everybody affected by the cancellation. Hopefully this will be 2024's final <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoff</a> post. It's certainly been <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">a long year</a>, and not just for video game developers.

            <p>
The announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking to Eurogamer this week</a>, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The specific section of the interview in question begins with Weber noting that, in the original Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski, Ciri is repeatedly described as a witcher, so you're all out of luck if you're arguing against her protagonism on the basis that it disagrees with the source material. He and Kalemba acknowledge that, yes, fair enough, Geralt is a good laugh and some people would love to have him back, but Ciri is already playable at points in The Witcher 3, and CD Projekt want to see what more they can do with her.
</p>
<p>
"I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well," Weber said. "So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care."
</p><p>
Did CD Projekt consider introducing a custom Witcher 4 protagonist, Eurogamer asked, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? "I think, honestly, this character-driven storytelling has been always in the DNA of our Witcher games," said Weber. "First with Geralt, and then, of course, we started setting up Ciri as a second protagonist in The Witcher 3, and now we want to continue with her as well." 
</p>
<p>
Weber added that what makes Ciri an intriguing choice of protag is partly that she <em>isn't</em> quite a witcher. She might not be a fully customisable character, but she has room to grow where grizzly Ger had already nailed down his Eastwoodian outsider persona by the time he became a video game leading man.
</p>
<p>
"One of the things that makes Ciri into an interesting new protagonist for us is, of course, also that she is at the beginning of her journey as a witcher," said Weber. "So as an example, Geralt was very, very experienced already. He went through so many things. And, you know, he created his own code, his value of neutrality, he created through so many experiences. And Ciri still has to make many of those experiences. She has to go through so many of these things. 
</p>
<p>
"So in a way, even though Ciri is, of course, a defined character, with her, players will have the opportunity to still define her quite a bit more, specifically define the path that she will take on her way to becoming a witcher, and basically also what kind of person that will make her."
</p><p>
Naturally, Ciri also promises to bring a fresh perspective to the broadly misogynistic, alternately sensitive and pervy universe of The Witcher, a video game series that once let you collect porno cards for female characters, and still loves to make a spectacle of its nubile sorceresses.
</p>
<p>
"I mean, I would say the world of The Witcher is a really dark one that's really inspired by, of course, dark fantasy folklore," Weber commented, when asked about the game's portrayal of gender politics and sexism. "But also medieval to early Renaissance history, and that is a world that was tough - tough for many different groups, women among them. As an example, in The Witcher, we also deal a lot with racism when it comes to non-humans, and this is something that we want to keep up with The Witcher 4. I think it's something that has always been really important. 
</p>
<p>
"We make games for adults, and it also means that we tackle some difficult topics," he suggested. "We tackle them in interesting ways. We tackle them without giving easy answers, but often opening difficult questions that players have to answer. And I think some of those questions might be going in this direction as well, because, yeah, Ciri is a woman, and as a witcher in this world, this is an unusual state. So I don't think it's going to be this story everywhere, but since this is a part of this world, and we want to tackle so many of those different themes, it's definitely also going to appear there as well."
</p>
<p>
There's also the tiniest snippet of hand-wavey commentary on the question of Ciri's various supernatural capabilities, and how they might disrupt the quest design and slash-dodge-aard combat of The Witcher 3. Will Ciri begin The Witcher 4 in a low-power state, without the talents she displayed towards the end of the previous game, enquired Eurogamer? CD Projekt don't have anything to share for the moment. 
</p><p>
"No, we cannot tell you exactly how," said Kalemba. "But we can tell you just, like, believe us: that was one of the things, or first things, that we were solving, to make sure - the way we develop here, we do not leave anything without a clear answer." OK then. 
</p>
<p>
Previously codenamed Polaris, The Witcher 4 is the first of several new Witcher experiences. You can read more about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">our announcement post</a>. If you're still pining for Geralt, you might prefer to read about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-unveil-codename-canis-majoris-as-the-witcher-remake">The Witcher 1 remake</a> in development at Fool's Theory. I wouldn't be surprised if it did away with some of the original game's laddier elements.
