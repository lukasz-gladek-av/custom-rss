            <p>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">financial earnings</a>. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Zelnick repeated that Rockstar would launch the criminalistic third-person city wrecker for consoles "in the fall" and also confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>'s summer release, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s release sometime "before year end". </p>
<p>It's a bit weird to write a news story which is essentially: "nothing has changed". Especially since Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">already told us the same thing in November last year</a>. Back then Zelnick said he was "highly confident in the timing". I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. </p>
<p>I know! Let's think of this news story as, oh, an investment. If GTA 6 <em>is</em> delayed, we can make a post about the delay and then link back to these two news items, with a headline like "GTA 6 has been delayed even though Take-Two told everyone it wouldn't be... twice". So if you're seeing this article from the future in which that has happened: hello!</p><p>The call also includes the usual business boasts. GTA V has sold 210 million copies, says Zelnick. GTA Online has spanned three console generations. Take-Two have an "extraordinary corporate database" that tracks 1 billion records about their players. "We observe all privacy regulations, of course." adds Zelnick, cyberpunkily.   </p>
<p>Most of this he says after being asked broadly about sales expectations and whether younger people will buy the game, with some brief stakeholder lipbiting over "lapsed players".</p>
<p>"We're looking over our shoulder," says Zelnick, "our competitors are not asleep... Rockstar Games in particular seeks perfection in everything they do."</p>
<p>It'd be good if they could perfectly give me a PC release date. I'm needy and insecure too!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
