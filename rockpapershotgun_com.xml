            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a> is a bit of an alarming game to look at. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game is so clearly an anime-esque riff on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a>, with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a> style web swinging thrown in for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. All of that's been obviously more or less since its announcement. But the game just received its first gameplay trailer at Tokyo Game Show, and it looks scarilyâ€¦ expensive.
</p>
<p>
Through the roughly seven minutes of gameplay, set to a song I can only describe as "song you let play on the radio while driving just because you want to fill the silence," more and more Things just kept happening. One minute the main character is driving a motorbike, the next they're taking a selfie through different scenes, one of which shows a mostly naked man escaping police on a robotic, walking toilet, and then the next they're fighting goons Yakuza-style in the street.
</p>

<p>
And more things keep happening after that! There's the aforementioned Spider-Man swinging, a giant city-destroying robot, and just so many fictitious shops with such well realised branding you could convince me I could actually visit them. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't even mentioning the fact that Ananta just wholesale rips off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s character transition, letting you hop into another, presumably gacha rolled, character's body, continuing on whatever they're doing. There's even quite an interesting use of this where you can do so while you're being held at gunpoint, with the switch to another character allowing you to snipe enemies from afar.
</p><p>
It really has that GTA ethos of "you can do everything," an ethos I don't necessarily feel great about considering the amount of labour likely required to achieve it, which raises questions of how ethical that labour was achieved. There's a chance it's teetering on the edge of having too much to do the do, to the point it becomes overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Ananta isn't just alarming because of how much of an "everything" game it presents itself as, but because I have some reservations about its narrative framing. The main character is the new captain of a special task force, essentially what seems to be the police. There's even a moment about halfway through where, as a different character, you can just handcuff and arrest an NPC.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can have games where you play as the police, there are good and interesting stories about police too, but I can't help but feel a bit concerned by such a, potentially small, gameplay feature. There's no amount of cute half-animal anime women that can make it easy to breeze past such a thing.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a game to be curious but cautious about, whenever it comes out.

            <p>This week, a streamer attempting to raise money for their own cancer treatment instead lost $32,000 to malware added to a new Steam game after release. The Steam game, BlockBlasters, has now been yanked from sale, and the malware distributors reportedly identified and confronted by free-roaming cybersecurity nerds. The streamer in question, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rastalandtv">RastalandTV</a>, has also been compensated for the theft. It's a happier ending than you often get from malware infection stories, and a reminder to be wary of random free games on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>Created by first-time Steam developer Genesis Interactive and published on 31st July, BlockBlasters is/was a free-to-play 2D action platformer about beating up crab monsters. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/another-malware-masquerading-as-a-steam-game-took-tens-of-thousands-from-streamers-cancer-recovery-donations/">PCGamer</a> and shared in this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tokyo-game-show-silent-hill-babel-city-building-and-an-rpg-about-a-fugitive-king">Maw</a> by MiniMatt, RastalandTV downloaded the game after being prompted to do so in his stream chat. RastalandTV <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258">noticed the scam</a> right in the middle of his fund-raising stream - be warned that the saved clip is very distressing.</p>
<p>As reported by cybersecurity site <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware">G Data</a>, BlockBlasters appears to have been updated with malware after launch. It was patched on August 30th with a batch file whose functions include gathering Steam login details together with IP and location info, and searching for installed anti-virus products. </p>
<p>Having carried out these functions, G Data report, the batch script then executes scripts from password-protected archives (whose contents can't, apparently, be detected during download) which record the user's browser extensions and crypto wallet information, amongst other things. I suspect I've made a hash of summarising G Data's analysis, so maybe read the rest on there.</p><p>Cryptocurrency investor Alex Becker has donated $30,000 to RastalandTV, so he's at least recovered the bulk of the money for his cancer treatment. Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1970170201736933604">vxunderground</a> and other "open source intelligence" peeps claim they have used Telegram credentials inside the malware to track down the scammers and investigate their social media feeds. They say they've contacted one of the malware distributors, who initially promised to return the money, then "nuked everything" instead. </p>
<p>A few of the internet sleuths have put together a <a href="https://vx-underground.org/Malware%20Analysis/2025/2025-09-21%20-%20Block%20Blasters%20-%20Forensic%20Report/Paper">report</a> that accuses Valve of "appalling levels of vetting". The report also suggests that the game may have been deliberately developed to serve as a Trojan horse for the malware, given that one of the alleged scammers was at one point "looking for a video game programmer to make a basic 2D game".</p>
<p>Another streamer has reported <a href="https://x.com/GEOFFCOINCRYPTO/status/1969393116529770720">losing $15,000 to the BlockBlasters malware</a>. A third <a href="https://x.com/TeddyxROO/status/1969341835077448125">says the scammers have been approaching various people in chat</a>, trying to get them to download the game. Thousands of Steam users own BlockBlasters, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/charts/">a SteamDB.info estimate</a>, and G Data say that hundreds may have downloaded the malware update. The site also claims that there has been "a rise in malware infections" from Steam games this year, citing another free-to-play title, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1inniw1/a_game_called_piratefi_released_on_steam_last/">PirateFi</a>, and early access game <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-sneaks-infostealer-malware-into-early-access-steam-game/">Chemia</a>.</p>
<p>Other than removing the game from Steam, Valve have yet to acknowledge or comment on the BlockBlasters story. I'll ask them if they have anything to share right now about Steam security procedures.</p>
