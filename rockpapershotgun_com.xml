            <p>
The future is here! Or, I guess it's around 40,000 years away, but that's still more or less here for the Total War series, which'll be tackling a futuristic setting for the first time in last night's reveal of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Warhammer 40,000 spin-off reveal</a>. It's got most of what you'd expect, like those mean ole Space Marines, and big, dramatic, explosive battles with so much going on on screen you'll get a hernia. But there were a few details shared in a post-reveal blog post that go into some small bits that weren't a part of the big reveal.
</p>
<p>
Right at the bottom of said <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/total-war-warhammer-40000">blog post</a> is an FAQ, with the first notable question there being "where are the Chaos Space Marines?" As it stands, the only revealed factions so far are the regular Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum. In response to that question, Creative Assembly explained that the Chaos Space Marines won't be there at launch, but they'll "absolutely" be a part of their plans "at some point, along with all the other iconic factions from the setting."
</p>
<p>
Then there's the question of modding. From right off the bat, the team wants to support modding on the Steam Workshop from launch, but it's the official modding tools you'll have to wait a while longer for. This is down to Creative Assembly's new Warcore engine, and they note that they'll have more details to share on that "close to launch." Oh, and don't worry, there won't be any blood DLC because the "41st Millennium is a setting of eternal war, so blood and dismemberment is key to creating an authentic experience."
</p>
<p>
The blog post also makes mention of a "small roundtable with members of the development team" coming next week on December 16th. Important to note that you shouldn't expect a big look at gameplay, it sounds like more of a light chat about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. A full look at its story and gameplay will apparently come in spring, so hang tight for now.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>’s promised free expansion is available to download right now, developers Sandfall Interactive have announced at this evening’s Trial by Keighley, aka the Game Awards. </p>
<p>The update includes new enemies and bosses, a new dungeon, enemies, new language support and costumes. The extra environment appears to be toy-themed and accessible later on in the game. If you’re concerned about spoilers (I myself still haven't finished this), I would skip the below trailer. I would also skip the below trailer if the prospect of death by lollipop strikes you as a bridge too far even for Clair Obscur, a game of many disarming eccentricities.

<p>The update includes a photo mode, all the better to check out the assortment of extra headgear and outfits. Why don't I wear a top hat like that, eh? Because I have neither the money nor the audacity, that's why. Anyway, let me weep in peace. Catch the full feature breakdown below, care of my old friend Monsieur Blockquote.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence…</li>
<li>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms. You can listen to the playlist on YouTube here.</li>
<li>Challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower. Besting these powerful adversaries will reward players with powerful new Pictos, costumes and gear.</li>
<li>A much-requested official Photo Mode, allowing players to pause the action and commemorate their favorite moments from the game’s story and battles.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19. </li>
<li>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and frame generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs.</li>
<li>New Quality of Life improvements, other new features and further improvements to the game’s performance across platforms, including on handheld PC systems. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Vinegar Dot Com regard the awards section of the Game Awards as so much flaking greasepaint for a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-reportedly-charges-over-1-million-for-a-three-minute-trailer-while-just-a-minute-can-run-up-nearly-half-of-that?preview_key=pMAvYLie7_Gilad_GyovTCtVBAFwDlQZ&amp;preview_device=desktop">expensive</a> marketing machine, but I will grudgingly note that Clair Obscur won a lot of gongs tonight, and that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">deserves the praise</a>. Today’s update looks to be a fitting victory lap.
