            <p>Are you from the UK and partial to risque adult Steam games, such as Amarillo's Butt Slapper - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> of Butt Slapping - or the timelessly iconic MILFs of Sunville? Bad! Naughty! GO DIRECTLY TO BED. Unless you have a valid credit card. Steam have begun rolling out a requirement for all UK-based users to verify their ages, if they wish to access store pages for games rated mature.</p>
<p>You should already have done this, of course, if you've bought anything on Steam, which I'm going to assume is 90% of you, with the other 10% being GOG stopouts, holier-than-thou Itch lovers and stinky pirates. According to reports, debit cards are acceptable too.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The regulation follows the passing of the UK's Online Safety Act, which now requires a host of online platforms to impose age verification systems, so as to protect younger people from pornography (among other things). I will offer no further comment on the OSA at this stage - it's after 2pm on Friday, which is far too late in the week to have Opinions - but I'm relieved to discover that I can still google images of donkey willies on a work PC. Eurogamer's Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">a fuller write-up</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Valve have a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Steam blog</a> up, which explains the process for age verification and the need for a credit card in particular.</p>
<p>"In the UK, Ofcom is the independent regulator for online safety. Ofcom's guidance on the OSA states that one highly effective age assurance measure is credit card checks," it reads. "This is because, in the UK, an individual must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, therefore credit card issuers are obliged to verify the age of an applicant before providing them with a credit card.
</p>
<p>"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the post continues.
</p>
<p>According to the Redditors who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1n34vzd/uk_users_must_verify_their_age_to_access_steam/">spotted all this earlier today</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-requires-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-mature-game-pages/">VGC</a>), debit cards appear to be acceptable at least for the time being. Which is good, because I don't have a credit card, and I'd sure hate to be unable to buy *googles random adult games again* "Ideology In Friction"? I didn't know Althusser made a porno.</p><p>Valve have had a busy few months in terms of adult-rated controversy. As you're hopefully very well aware, given that we wouldn't shut up about it, they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">changed</a> Steam's regulations to give banks and credit card networks a say on the definition of acceptable NSFW games. A bunch of games have been delisted as a consequence. In connection to all that, Paypal recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">pulled support for Steam purchases in certain countries</a> at the behest of one of their acquiring banks.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta may be over, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> might also have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-pave-over-battlefield-2042s-bullet-casing-filled-potholes-with-a-road-to-battlefield-6">transformed into Battlefield 6</a>, but there must be more battles in the fields of six, so sign-ups for another round of Labs testing are now open. Two fresh maps with plenty of room for vehicle-based fisticuffs will be on offer, as well as a chance to check out the server browser that may well be chock full of 24/7 scraps once the final game launches.</p>
<p>EA have wheeled out all of this info in two separate <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">blog</a> <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1961084754091995529">posts</a>, which follow neatly on from them running down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">all of their learnings from the open beta</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the two maps. Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley are set to debut, and if you were among the many miffed at the open beta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-betas-rush-mode-gets-a-balancing-tweak-with-ea-monitoring-the-situation-amid-player-complaints-about-battle-bigness">largely sticking to smaller maps</a>, you'll be glad to hear that they facilitate larger scraps with "a diverse range of vehicles, from quad bikes to tanks and aircraft".</p>
<p>As you might expect, their inclusion's part of EA working to ensure "balancing occurs across different-sized environments" following the open beta. "Improvements to weapons, large-scale vehicular combat, gadget balancing, and more" are all on the publisher's radar to monitor and tweak. This round of testing'll  also be used to lock in "the official setting for Hardcore mode", so put on your best killing pants.</p><p>If you hop into this latest Labs test, you'll also get your first chance to muck around with a work-in-progress version of Battlefield 6's server browser. Its features will be "intentionally limited" so EA can focus on making sure it's stable and useable at a basic level. Basically, making sure folks can set up a server via a shortcode, fill out its description and tags, then host away trouble-free as other players join and leave.</p>
<p>Those who've grown up jumping into 24/7 servers that serve you one map on repeat and don't disappear when everyone goes to bed at the end of the first day will be glad to know EA have confirmed custom servers will be persistent. It won't cost you any extra over the base price of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> either, which is a nice bit of non-money-grabbing from EA, and should mean Battlefield 6 has less trouble establishing a strong sense of community out of the gate.</p>
<p>If you've not taken part in any Battlefield 6 Labs tests to this point, you can <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">head here to sign up</a>. Though, there's no guarantee you'll be granted access either right away or at all, as the spots are much more limted than the open beta.</p>
