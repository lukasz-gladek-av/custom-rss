The thing about computers is that they're just really annoying, actually. They're massively complicated, constantly changing machines, and despite the fact the hardware is technically better now, they can sometimes struggle to run older games because of… reasons. Those reasons often being software issues I won't even attempt to understand. So, it always brings a smile to my face when I see another game back from the dead through the efforts of GOG's preservation program, the most recent entry being the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breath-of-fire-iv">Breath of Fire 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
You see, Breath of Fire 4 did actually have a PC release way back in the day. It was originally released for the PS1 back in 2000, later coming to PC in 2003, though only for Japan and Europe. As mentioned, the problem with older PC games is that they don't always work on modern hardware, and ignoring that it can be tough to track down legitimate copies of certain games. With <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 joining GOG's preservation program</a> however, it's now playable on Windows 10 and 11.

Outside of that, there's a few new display options like a windowed mode, V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing, and refined gamma correction for better visuals, alongside an upgrade to the audio engine. That one has brought back some previously missing environmental sounds, and you'll have a few options to tinker around with now too. Plus, it being GOG, the game is DRM-free, so if you decide to pick it up it's yours forever.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 isn't the only game to be spruced up either, there's other classics like Ultima Underworld 1+2, Worms: Armageddon, and Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon. Good stuff! Looking forward to whatever the GOG preservation program brings back next.

            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!
</p>

<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

<p>
The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.
