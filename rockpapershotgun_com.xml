            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> studio id Software are now home to a "wall-to-wall" union according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA's press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of "developers, artists, programmers, and more" - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. "Remote work isn’t a perk," he said. "It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being."</p><p>The CWA release also cited "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass industry layoffs</a>, sudden periods of crunch time, and unfair pay" as part of the impetus behind a wider push towards unionisation among devs across the industry this year, adding that the total of unionised workers across Microsoft's fiefdom is now "nearly 4,000" strong.</p>
<p>CWA president Ron Swaggerty added that the union "look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication these workers bring to every project."</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the CWA's unionisation efforts as the games industry's suits and moneyfolk continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announce-mass-layoffs-with-over-100-uk-staff-reportedly-expected-to-be-at-risk">lob</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">developers</a> out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">windows</a> with depressing regularity, give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">this interview Nic did</a> a read.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, members of the "industry-wide union" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">the CWA announced</a> earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1999257505751532008">held a protest</a> outside of The Game Awards yesterday, with their aim being to "to acknowledge the video games and studios that have been closed and to also condemn the creativity that’s been crushed by corporate greed and studio executives".
</p>
<p>Solidarity to these id Software workers.</p>

            <p>
I have to say, it does tickle me that pretty much anyone involved with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> just seem to still want to make Left 4 Dead. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-anacrusis">The Anacrusis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> both were made by folks who worked on the original co-op shooter, and now the original lead designer of it Mike Booth is back with yet another incarnation, 4:Loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-dev-mike-booth-has-teamed-up-with-jj-abrams-to-make-another-four-player-shooter-with-purple-aliens-this-time">revealed at Geoff's Ads and Statues Evening</a>. As part of that reveal, Booth took part in a little interview over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/announcing-4loop-a-new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-sie-and-bad-robot-games/">PlayStation Blog</a> where he touched on the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> mechanics, and how excited he is for people to break them.
</p>
<p>
Booth explained that he's been a fan of roguelikes since the original Rogue, and how the genre appeals to him because of the ways you can be creative in achieving certain goals. "Some runs even feel like you have such a great combination of tools that you 'break the game,'" Booth said, also noting that with 4:Loop he does still just want to let people "jump in and play."
</p>
<p>
We'll come back to that game breaking stuff in a moment, but first here's how Booth explains the core loop. Essentially, you and three of your buds need to try and destroy an alien mothership, with each mission you embark on letting you make different choices to improve equipment. Along the way, you might pick up certain items that help you out in tricky scenarios.
</p>
<p>
One such scenario Booth described was an instance where a playtester was trying to outrun a lethal beam of some sort that basically means game over if you can't get to the escape zone in time. Said playtester had picked up an item called a blink berry, which you can sort of throw like a grenade, and wherever it lands it'll teleport whatever it hits to somewhere random. So, the playtester threw it at themself, was teleported away, and made it to the escape zone in time.
</p><p>
"I built both of those game mechanics and had never even considered that strategy," Booth said. "I’m excited to see how our gaming community 'breaks the game' in other unexpected ways." Apparently there's bit of "meta-progression" where you learn things about the world and how it works that "give you an edge for your next run."
</p>
<p>
From the sounds of things it won't be a full-on roguelike, maybe more towards a roguelite, something to keep runs fresh rather than just taking hordes of aliens on over and over again. No release date attached to this one yet, so, just keep replaying Left 4 Dead like you I'm assuming you already do.

            <p>
When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a> was revealed back in September, it quickly became apparent how Simply Not Great this thing looked. There was way too strong of a "we have to make this thing look new and modern and well lit" vibe to it that did not go down very well with pretty much anyway. It even tried to convince us that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-deus-ex-remastered-i-simply-do-not-believe-you-need-an-rtx-2080-to-run-at-recommended-settings">you'd need an RTX 2080 to run it at the recommended settings</a>! The gall! And here we are, almost three months later, with word that the game has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Not only has it been delayed, but it's been delayed indefinitely. Yesterday, developer Aspyr shared a statement on Bitter announcing the delay, writing that they've "listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Further than that, anyone that's preordered the game will receive a full refund. The statement doesn't provide any details other than that, nor when Aspyr expect to share any other details about the remaster. 
</p>
<p>
If you were someone desperate to jump back into a slightly flashier version of Deus Ex (but as Mark noted at the time of the remaster's announcement, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">you can bag the OG for only £6</a>, so I'm not sure why you'd want such a thing), I'd keep your expectations in check for now. Such an overhaul will take quite a while.
</p><p>
It is worth noting that it's not just the graphics that got a new look. There are supposed quality-of-life improvements like autosaves, faster loading, controller support, little things we take for granted now essentially. When the time comes, it might be a nice new way to play the game, but for now, put it at the back of your mind.
