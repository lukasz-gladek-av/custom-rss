            <p>NetEase have shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment, a studio founded in 2023 by former BioWare developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> executive producer Rich Vogel.</p>
<p>The studio had been working on an online multiplayer sci-fi action game, with contributions from a number of ex-BioWare and Bethesda staff including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> design lead Mark Tucker and senior producer Scott Malone. However, that project and T-Minus Zero Entertainment's on-going existence are not a good fit for "current market conditions".</p><!--more-->
<p>Vogel announced the end of NetEase's partnership with T-Minus in a LinkedIn post on 26th August. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-shuts-down-rich-vogel-led-t-minus-zero-entertainment">Game Developer</a> have now obtained confirmation that the studio has been closed down, in the absence of other funding.</p>
<p>"Every journey has its twists and turns, and ours with NetEase is coming to an end," Vogel writes in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/t-minus-zero-entertainment_an-update-on-t-minus-zero-every-journey-activity-7365874626570170369-U_ZD/">the LinkedIn statement</a>. "We deeply appreciate NetEase for providing us with both ample runway and support - from helping us find potential investors to giving us the time and budget to develop our game into a fully playable hands-on demo. It has generated a lot of interest. However, despite this progress, current market conditions have prevented us from securing the funding we need at this time."</p><p>Vogel goes on to celebrate his team's "dedication and passion" adding that "now may not be the best time to seek funding given today's climate, but our playable demo proves our potential to develop something fresh and exciting that will resonate with players for years."</p>
<p>As Game Developer report, senior NetEase staff have commented on the post to praise the bygone studio's work, with former NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu commenting that the prototype "delivers [the] great fantasy of fighting against 15th floor kaiju to protect the city you care about" while NetEase head of brand/publishing for North America &amp; Europe Cisco Maldonado called it a "super great concept and [in my opinion] a solid market fit".</p>
<p>Approached for comment, a NetEase spokesperson told Game Developer that "this decision was made with careful consideration, as we have been inspired by our partnership with the studio and their bold vision. However, we have had to reassess our business priorities and are now working closely with the studio to provide support and explore next steps."</p>
<p>NetEase have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">cutting staff and projects recently</a>, after investing in several studios founded by big names in the triple-A business. Last November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">called time on Worlds Untold</a>, a studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> writer Mac Walters. In January this year, they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">did likewise for Jar Of Sparks</a>, the studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook. In February, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">trimmed down the Marvel Rivals development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">made layoffs at Liquid Swords</a>, the studio founded by Avalanche co-founder Christofer Sundberg.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all the former T-Minus Zero Entertainment employees now looking for a safe port. </p>

        <p>I swear, it's always been like this you s'wit</p>

            <p>Remember when, back in the day, you made the trek through the ashlands to Red Mountain? Within, you encountered an unforgettable foe. "Come, Nerevar. Friend or traitor, come. Come and look upon the Heart, and Akulakhan. And bring Wraithguard... I have need of it", they said. "Heed my words. I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a>. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat."</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe not, but it's a nice image with which to open the news that a modder's managed to port the entirety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s landmass into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's still very much a work-in-progress, as you might expect given its version of Vvardenfell's populated by copies of the same random woman and goats, but it certainly makes for a surreal watch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Morrowind is one of my favorite games of all-time, but god damn is it dated," the modder in question, YouTuber InfernoPlus, explained in video showing off their Elden Scrolls. "So, my goal here is to try and combine the world and lore of Morrowind with the combat of a Souls game. Basically, just taking the best parts of both and slapping them together into a common fruit and scrib jelly sandwich."</p>
<p>The result so far is a really cool re-creation of all the locations you remember from Morrowind, rendered with the extra fidelity and weather effects possible in the engine of a modern FromSoft game. You can wander through the streets of Balmora, gaze out at the ghost fence from Red Mountain, and even pop by Vivec to dick around on its namesake's favourite hovering spot.</p><p>You won't find the Warrior-Poet there though, nor any other Dunmer, Argonians or other Elder Scrolls races across the landscape of Dagoth Souls though. As I mentioned, InfernoPlus has stuck clones of a generic Elden Ring lady in as placeholders for humanoid NPCs, with goats serving the same role for every creature. These mysterious women, who one can only assume are evidence of Divayth Fyr getting up to even more daughter-clone-siring than in the base game, do have written dialogue, but only speak the sound of a page turning. They all also assume the player's already dealt with Dagoth Ur, which is probably why they look to be in happier spirits than the game's usual insult-spitting blue blokes.</p>
<p>"I've done a fair bit of research on what remaining work is left, and from what I can tell, everything I want to do is possible," the modder explains later on the video. "It really just comes down to the number of hours it's going to take to build it all out."</p>
<p>Interestingly, he notes that he tried cramming Morrowind into both the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> before turning to Eddie Rang, because it'd come without the headache of being close to the world-loading restrictions. He's also not worried about any Lionel Hutzes from Bethesda or FromSoftware potentially seeing one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo0nuQCq10w">couple of videos</a> he's now posted about the mod, declaring that "this project does not violate any copyright whatsoever".</p>
<p>If, or when, this mod makes it to release, InfernoPlus adds that it'll work a bit like the <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/">Tale of Two Wastelands</a> mod which merges <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> into one experience that allows you to travel between the two games' worlds. As such, you'll need to own a copy of Morrowind and a copy of Elden Ring to give it a go.</p>
