            <p>The developers of post-apocalyptic shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl</a> have shared a roadmap for future updates, promising new guns, smarter foes, and a helpful development kit for modders. Among the changes is good news for anyone frustrated after pumping their entire backpack of bullets into 30 to 50 feral hogs. Murderised mutants will now drop loot of some kind, instead of offering no reward at all.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>We're not told what kind of loot they'll drop, but in the developer's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/572627883580720125">roadmap post on Steam</a> there's a little picture of a tooth scribbled next to the note "mutant loot". So probably lots of handy gizzards and guts. Currently, when you kill a mutant, their corpses are simply empty. This is unlike defeated human foes who can be ransacked for bullets, food, and boots. This means that a series of mutant encounters can quickly drain your ammunition stocks. Especially when it comes to the spongier beasts. And getting nothing back after firing all that precious ammo into hides can feel frustrating to some.</p>
<p>Like I say, it's not the only upcoming change. The developers listed their other priorities for the next three months in the post. Smarter enemy and ally AI are high on the list, with "better cover/flanking use" and "limited grenades". Mutants will soon eat fallen victims if all goes to plan, and will "react to threats". There will also be two new weapons, we're told, alongside widescreen support and "further stabilization".  </p>

 </a>
<figcaption>I got nothing for killing this? What a boar. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/GSC Game World</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another item on the list is a beta for a planned "ModKit". While there are already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-bulletsponge-mutants-can-be-nerfed-with-this-handy-mod-saving-you-precious-rounds">plenty of handy mods</a> for Stalker 2 (including one that already adds <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389">mutant loot</a>), this SDK will come packaged with a guide and might make modders' lives a little easier. The devs are also planning to set up Steam Workshop support, so players can add mods easily from there. </p>
<p>These plans might change, say GSC Game World in a flavoury disclaimer scribbled at the bottom of the stained note: "Mission targets may be moved from Q2 to later dates in case of Zone instability." </p>
<p>Stalker 2 launched in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-is-out-now-and-buggy-as-hell-but-the-developers-are-already-planning-fixes">very buggy state</a> but was well-received despite the jank. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a> James called it "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off". Soon after the radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> came out, the developers admitted that some important features, such as the "A-life" simulation of patrolling squads, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">simply broken</a>. But they've been routinely and reliably patching things since then, with the latest significant batch of fixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-latest-patch-once-again-comes-with-four-figures-worth-of-fixes-and-improvements">landing last month</a>. </p>
<p>James also once became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beastmaster-of-stalker-2-part-one-how-to-make-friends-and-eviscerate-people">a beastmaster with lots of mutant minions</a> in the game. I wonder how he feels now his "friends" will soon become skinnable loot rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'm thankfully very remote from the capital these days, but Edwin will occasionally regale the morning meeting with dark fables about how much a pint now costs in London. He'll stumble on to camera, his eyes bloodshot and breathing heavy, and we'll all know he's traded a new vital organ for a swift half. Occasionally he'll dart his head around to the sound of banging at the door then immediately dive out of the window, and we'll pray for his safe return after outrunning The Bad Teapot gang, who he borrowed £8000 from in 2006 for a warm plastic beaker of Carling with a dead wasp floating in it. Sounds bleak down there.</p>
<p>As such, I would not blame anyone south of the Severn-Wash for resorting to the stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle </a>drink stealing antics we find in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sipssassin">Sipssassin</a>. You play a bald, sharply dressed sneak thief. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never pay for another drink as long as you live. There are some nonsense lore reasons about why it's actually good and cool that you're half-inching everyone's tipples but that just makes it less fun, honestly. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Many classic stealth tricks are available to you. Disguising yourself as a security guard. Hiding in a cardboard box. Burying yourself in a ridiculously-placed hay bale. Putting a moose head over your victim's eyes so they can't see you pinch their margarita. As with classic Hitman, there are also a selection of mundane objects to bonk people with, stunning them so you can make a getaway. You're not confined to just Agent 47's disappointing son, either. You'll also unlock other characters, one of which is Agent 47's much less disappointing son, a horrible goose.</p>
<p>There are four game modes in all. 'Sipstraction' tasks you simply with stealing six drinks then scoring you on how many times you were discovered. In 'Happy Hour' you'll need to combo guzzle as many ill-gotten bevvies as possible in a two minute time limit. 'Drinkvesitage' involves a "special tracking activity", and there's also an exploration free roam mode, where you'll take on side quests and meet characters. I'll let good mate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820190/Sipssassin/">Steam</a> describe the features. That's just good business sense, that.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>25 playable characters to unlock</li>
<li>5 unique missions with hidden secrets</li>
<li>4 distinct game modes to prove your Sipssassin abilities</li>
<li>Over 60 different drinks to drink</li>
<li>Lots of NPCs to steal drinks from</li>
<li>6 Legendary Drinks that grant special power up abilities</li>
<li>6 Special Gadgets that help you be a sneaky little guy</li>
<li>50 collectible shards to find and rebuild the Chalice of Destiny</li>
<li>Disguises to gain access to restricted areas</li>
<li>Wacky characters to meet and talk to</li>
<li>An alternate dimension video game conference called "Yeet3"</li>
<li>A super long straw so you can drink your neighbor's milkshake</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sipsassin is due out on May 2nd, 2025. No price details, yet. Slightly more than a wasp pint, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>15 years on from the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a>, I still think with fondness and yearning of the Uboinik automatic shotgun. It’s a six chamber cylindrical affair with mouthwatering red shells that dangle before your trigger finger like pert, juicy plums. This is just to say / I have shot / the shells / that were in / the shotgun / and which / you were probably / saving / for the mutant round the corner. / Forgive me / they were murderous / so sockety / and so round. Ahem.</p>
<p>Reloading the shotgun is an intricate process of 1) sliding four shells into the available chambers while tossing the weapon jauntily from hand to hand, and then 2) cocking it again to expose and fill the remaining two chambers. You can also chamber a single shell and cock the weapon, if you don’t have time for a full reload, which means when you load another four shells and fire them, there’ll be an empty chamber to reckon with midway through the next burst. That empty chamber has gotten me killed a dozen times, I think.</p><!--more-->

<p>Somebody poured love into that reloading animation. Love and a certain spitefulness. This is Metro 2033, 4A Games’s spiritual successor to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which takes place in the Moscow underground after the nukes. Ammo is also currency here, and the dingy rails teem with bandits and mutants. There is no time to get poetic about shotguns. Today, 15th April, you can experience all that love and spitefulness for free. The Redux edition is 100% off on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a> till tomorrow to mark the game’s 15th birthday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-metro-2033">the RPS review of the original Metro 2033</a>, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) was wooed but not wowed, calling attention to “a jarring disconnect between the excellence of its appearance and the adequacy of its action. 

"It’s a good enough shooter, but it looks like it should be a phenomenal one,” he went on. “In a perfect world, there’ll be a mod that fiddles with the balance, maybe ups the human count and lowers the mutant count, and definitely leaves a few more gas masks lying around.” </p>
<p>The 2014-released Redux version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metro-redux-review">adds a bunch of modes and graphics features</a>: as Christopher Livingston summarised, “if you enjoyed Metro 2033, I strongly suspect you'll like it even more on the new engine, especially since the options for a grueling, hardcore experience are still there despite the revamped stealth and improved AI making things a little easier for you.”</p>
<p>The typical question to ask of any 4A Games news piece is: which 4A Games, exactly? The studio began life in Ukraine in 2006, but in 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta. While they've collaborated on Metro for years, the two studios are now totally separate: 4A Games in Ukraine have rebranded as Reburn, and are now developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, while Metro remains in the hands of the Malta studio, who are still owned by Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
