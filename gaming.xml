			<p>The development history of Lost Soul Aside reads like an epic fantasy in and of itself. Originally the dream project of a solo developer, Yang Bing, it was revealed in 2016 before being picked up as part of Sony’s China Hero Project. Between 2016 and 2025, however, the game went through various different teams and visions, finally being released as a weird fusion of Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, and an Anime 101 storytelling guidebook. The end result is a fascinating mess that isn’t a complete disaster but instead manages to be almost the dictionary definition of mediocre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRhg0RYYsa0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First, up, Lost Soul Aside has some fairly impressive production values. At times it looks really nice and the framerate was mostly satisfactory on a base PS5 using performance mode, although there were moments when I wasn’t sure if there were deliberate slow-mo effects or if the game was lagging somewhat. Environments are varied, albeit following the generic pattern of fire zone, ice zone etc. Voice acting is functional but the English dub isn’t going to win any awards (the actors don’t have a great deal to work with to be fair), while the music is decent with some great battle music and area themes.</p>


<p>The solid quality of the game’s aesthetics is undermined, however, by an almost complete lack of any individuality. Almost every character looks like they’ve been lifted from a generic anime protagonist class, and my wife immediately thought it was a Final Fantasy game despite having little to no interest in gaming. Your main character, Kaser, is an emo cypher with long black trenchcoat and a taciturn personality, whilst his companions are various flavours of waifu (the goth one, the noble but reserved one, etc.). Your quest starts out as a political one as you fight against the tyrannical Empire as the guerrilla group, Glimmer. It soon shifts into a more magical tale as a demonic force known as the Voidrax begin to steal the souls of humans, with Kaser’s sister, Louisa, being one of their victims.</p>


<p>The early stages of the game are very slow, but I quite liked the setting and characters until it took a turn for the more generic fantasy narrative. The Emperor becomes a slightly more complex character as the game progresses and continues to wear the most ludicrously oversized helmet this side of Mel Brooks’ Spaceballs. After the Voidrax attack, you become linked to a mysterious power called Lord Arena, who has been trapped for centuries, whilst his power is used to develop the technological breakthroughs of the Empire. Arena is ostensibly a giant dragon, but his power is so diminished that he manifests as a far smaller presence, as well as seemingly being your weapons too.</p>
<p>There is the bones of an interesting story here but, whether due to translation or lack of experience, it feels like a flow chart of ideas rather than anything more complex. You soon have to complete the traditional McGuffin quest as you go off in search of Life Crystals.</p>

<p>So, Lost Soul Aside looks decent and is entirely generic but does it offer anything new? Well, kind of, since the combat system is fluid and filled with potential. You start off with a standard sword, but unlock a huge two-handed version, a speedy polearm, and a scythe as you progress. These all have secondary skills that are vital in area progression, which is welcome but they are rarely mixed up and feel as by the numbers as much of the rest of the game. Combat itself features an unlockable combo tree and an impressive number of attacks considering the two button controls. Alongside the light and heavy attacks you have various skills and can call on Lord Arena to power your attacks when the relevant metre is filled.</p>
<p>Each of the weapons feel pretty distinct in combat and you can switch between them on the fly. Some enemies are susceptible to different elements so later in the game you can equip different versions of each weapon to take advantage of this. As with Final Fantasy XVI, though, this aspect is underdone and could have been used to greater effect. As well as elemental characteristics, you pick up weapon charms that add extra bonuses. These actually have to be fitted onto the weapons themselves and can lead to some ludicrous looking creations if you want. I found that the ones adding base attack bonus and health renewal on criticals were the most effective.</p>

<p>This combat system comes into its own in a number of challenging boss fights but these are few and far between as most of the time you’ll be fighting mobs of similar looking enemies that offer little in the way of challenge. The vast majority of battles can be overcome by spamming the light attack, especially when you unlock the polearm and scythe which are both fast enough to overwhelm your opponents. I’m curious as to whether the combat comes into its own more on the harder difficulty unlocked upon completion but not enough to draw me back into the game yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious feature here is the fact that Kaser pulls off some amazing acrobatics and magical transformations but all in non-interactive cutscenes. I actually found myself longing for some QTEs just to feel involved in some way. I wouldn’t be surprised if these were originally a feature but were removed as that feature became less popular. The end result, though, is a series of long corridor levels with brainless battles, inane dialogue, only occasionally redeemed with boss battles that require you to use the full range of skills in a depressingly under-utilised combat system.</p>

            <p>
There's plenty of debate online around the difficulty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but while most of us are struggling, speedrunners have already beaten the game in under 90 minutes mere days after release.
</p>
<p>
The record is moving fast, literally! Yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaRbJ-y0tI">YouTuber Onaku</a> managed a Silksong any% speedrun in 1:46:47, but hours later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If8bCzk3MCw">YouTuber BlueSR</a> managed a run in 1:26:20. What's more, the speedrunner will be aiming for an even quicker World Record time today.
</p>
<p>
I've linked to the runs of both speedrunners above, but of course these will be full of spoilers for anyone still back in the early game. Or perhaps you're keen to check out some expert strategies.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/silksong">official speedrunning leaderboard</a> won't open until 1st October, at which point we'll have a firm idea of the World Record time and the official rules. Until then, speedrunners will be rapidly sharing their times on social media.
</p>
<p>
Judging by the game's achievements, it's possible to achieve 100 percent game completion in under 30 hours, but there's also an achievement for completing the game in under five hours (aptly named "Speedrunner"). So even if a run of just over an hour isn't achievable for you, those looking to gain all achievements will still need to complete an exceptionally fast run.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, the current <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/hollowknight">World Record for the original Hollow Knight</a> sits at just over 30 minutes!

            <p>Microsoft have announced plans to roll out a policy which will mandate that staff return to working from the office at least three days per week, with a first phase of it set to come into force as of February 2026.</p>
<p>In a memo about the move shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">The Verge</a>, Microsoft executive vice president and chief people officer Amy Coleman asserted that it's "not about reducing headcount". The mandate comes just a couple of months after the company's mass layoffs which saw about 9,000 employees let go and several games cancelled. The bloodletting hasn't stopped since that point either, with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-layoffs-continue-into-5th-consecutive-month/">The Seattle Times</a> reporting this week that Microsoft have laid off a further 42 employees, bringing the total to 15,000 since May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive — they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results," Coleman wrote in the memo about the proposed return to office. "As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together. With that in mind, we’re updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office." The Verge report that some teams at Microsoft might be expected to work from the office four or five days a week, and that some roles like consulting will be exempt.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to read that the RTO mandate reflects the company's wider plans for generative AI. Microsoft have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">shovelling billions of dollars into AI tech</a> over the course of this year, a move that definitely doesn't have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/23/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst-and-send-the-stock-market-into-freefall">the potential to end terribly</a> pretty soon. Back in July, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">spoke of the need</a> for a "messy" organisational transformation to carry out Microsoft's aims for genAI, while talking around the "incongruence" between the company's vast profits and mass layoffs.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren cites some Microsoft staff he spoke to last month as having agreed that this return to office mandate could be seen as a form of 'soft' or 'stealth' layoffs. This is something companies instituting return to office mandates have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">accused of</a> for a number of years now, with the logic being that in rescinding the option of full-time remote work, these businesses are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandates-layoffs-quit-jobs-hybrid-remote-work-office-2025-5">making an effort to push certain staff towards leaving voluntarily</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you're a worker facing a lengthy commute, a move to a different place in order to be able to go into the office while maintaining a decent work/life balance, or have a disability/condition and aren't able to secure an exception, the word 'voluntarily' might be doing some heavy lifting there. Microsoft staff will reportedly be able to apply for an exception to this mandate by September 19th.</p>
<p>Clearly aiming to get out ahead of any accusations along those lines, Coleman wrote in her memo: "Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It’s about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers’ needs."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Communication Workers of America union, which have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">helped organise several of the unions that've been formed at game studios under the Microsoft/Xbox banner in recent years</a>, for comment.</p>
<p>The proposed first phase of Microsoft's proposed return to office mandate is set to only affect staff who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington. The second and third phases set to follow with "other US locations" and then staff outside the US further down the line.</p>
<p>Aside from the job cuts, Microsoft have also recently faced protests over their links to the Israeli government, something you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">read more about in this feature from Edwin</a>.</p>

            <p>It's not a good time for Bungie. This year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion, The Edge of Fate, is widely regarded as one of the worst expansions the game has ever seen - a big feat to achieve when you're 11 years old. As intriguing as some of the new story developments in the expanding world of Destiny are, little could soften the impact of some atrocious decision-making from the sandbox and gear teams within the studio: the grind in Destiny has rarely been worse, and fans' patience for the MMOFPS is becoming increasingly thin.</p>
<p>Even the blowout reveal of what should have been a slam dunk for Bungie - a Star Wars collab <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">that was initially announced back in May</a> - has been met with apathy and disinterest. Renegades (to give the event its proper name) will be the first ever crossover-themed campaign in Destiny's complicated history, and operates in a muddy middle ground between full crossover and vague skin-based collab.</p>
<p>"Renegades merges Destiny's distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise," Bungie enthuses in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-inspired-expansion-detailed-launches-december-2/">its own press release</a>. In the expansion, we "will defy the Vanguard" to pursue Drifter across Sol, navigating a world of shadows and syndicates in the new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, as we work across story missions to build a crew and resist a rising faction tied to the Nine.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video above, Renegades positions an activity called the Lawless Frontier front and center: per Bungie, it's "a chaotic, cooperative new game mode, where players take on a variety of high-risk jobs and contracts to earn reputation, unlock all-new Renegade abilities that change the tide of battle, and wield weapons that include the iconic Praxic Blade and an energy-based arsenal from the new Blaster archetype." A new dungeon is also promised to land after the expansion's launch on 2nd December.</p><p>But, frankly, who cares? This should have been a home run for Bungie - a big crossover like this is often catnip for MMO ride-or-dies - but the general consensus amongst the community at the moment is one of exhausted apathy. After the presentation that debuted information on both Renegades and the other incoming expansion, Ash &amp; Iron, the top post on Destiny's dedicated Subreddit reads: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ncz9u7/i_think_tonight_this_is_a_breakpoint_for_many/">I think tonight this is a breakpoint for many people and Bungie as a whole</a>.

<p>Now, I've been a member of /r/DestinyTheGame for about 12 years, and even since the early days (alpha and beta for D1!), the sub has had toxicity issues. Go figure. But this is something else: I don't think I've ever seen the community so fed up and bored with basically everything that is suggested.</p>
<p>The problem is three-fold: as well as Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-following-years-of-criticism-layoffs-and-that-infamous-classic-car-collection">losing key staff</a> that have overseen the Destiny vision since inception, the remaining designers have also implemented sandbox aspects players actively hate - namely, The Portal, a high-grind, low-reward anomaly of game design that actively punishes you for wanting choice in the things you do and the gear you equip. Decisions like these seem to manifest because of a studio culture<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue"> that "stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture,"</a> per one recent report.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this point, it feels like Bungie's back is against a wall: player numbers are dropping, player satisfaction is low, and even massive crossover events like Star Wars are failing to stem the haemorrhaging. As a big new update lands, concurrent player counts on Steam are even struggling to reach 50k - a historic low for the game. Will this trend reverse by December, when the Star Wars update actually launches? We'll have to wait and see but right now, it doesn't seem likely.</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62ddaba56e80d/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo, in its ongoing battle against Pocketpair and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>, has been filing various patents left, right, and centre in the US, the latest of which is almost certainly cause for concern.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>, Patent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-custom-tracking-id="5652783286200639599" data-google-interstitial="false" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-hl-processed="none" data-url="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf" href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf">No. 12,403,39</a> has been granted which essentially covers the summoning of a sub character and letting it fight on your behalf. Now, we're not sure about you, but we can already think of quite a few games that make use of such mechanics outside of Pokémon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, for example?</p>
<p>It goes into further detail and states that the sub character can either be controller by issuing commands, or it can act on its own accord, battling enemies automatically should any appear within the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>So, according to analysis from Games Fray, games that make us of <em>all</em> of the following could potentially trigger an infringement lawsuit from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. There must be a PC, console or other computing device and the game is stored on a drive or similar storage medium.</p>
<p>2. You can move a character in a virtual space.</p>
<p>3. You must be able to summon a character. They call it a “sub character” by which they mean it’s not the player character, but, for example, a little monster such as a Pokémon that the player character has at its disposal.</p>
<p>Then the logic branches out, with items 4 and 5 being mutually exclusive scenarios, before reuniting again in item 6.</p>
<p>4. This is about summoning the “sub character” in a place where there already is another character that it will then (when instructed to do so) fight.</p>
<p>5. This alternative scenario is about summoning the “sub character” at a position where there is no other character to fight immediately.</p>
<p>6. This final step is about sending the “sub character” in a direction and then letting an automatic battle ensue with another character. It is not clear whether this is even needed if one previously executed step (4) where the “sub character” will basically be thrown at another character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world of patents is complicated, and we've no doubt that there will be a number of loop holes that developers could potentially take advantage of to avoid Nintendo's wrath. It's not good though, is it? This is such a wide-reaching game mechanic, and so many titles already make use of it.</p>
<p>This isn't just targeting Palworld, let's put it that way. Whether Nintendo actually intends to make use of the patent in its legal battle against Pocketpair is unclear at this stage, but the mere fact that it exists is a bit of a blow.</p>

            <p>
In my experience, there are two kinds of tank in Battlefield games. There are the ones driven by other people, which are cut from solid granite yet move like ballet dancers. And then there are the ones driven by me, which are made out of candy floss and handle like shopping trolleys. Possibly, this reflects some kind of underlying "skill issue", but come now, that's speculative reporting that flies in the face of logic. <em>Clearly</em> it's a balancing issue. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> lead producer David Sirland with a little more, based on learnings during the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games%22%22">shooter</a>'s multiplayer beta.
</p>
<p>
You may have found that the tanks, helicopters, jeeps and jets on show in said Battlefield 6 beta were somewhat squishy, versus the hardiness of infantry and especially, engineers equipped with anti-tank mines and rockets. Responding to an aggrieved Xitter post (as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-producer-acknowledges-vehicles-were-underpowered-in-the-beta-but-says-its-better-than-the-alternative-rather-have-too-weak-vehicles-over-too-powerful/">PCGamer</a>), Sirland acknowledged that there's a balancing issue here, but also, suggested that developers DICE, Ripple, Motive and Criterion may have lowballed the rides to begin with, in order to set a good foundation.
</p>
<p>
"That is a balance issue wholesale, not specific to this special situation however," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1965413764414718144">wrote</a>, when one user complained about the potency of said engineers and their dastardly munitions. "And one we are actively working on. Rather have too weak vehicles over too powerful to start. Its a tricky one as players get better at using them over time as well."
</p>
<p>
I find this both funny and interesting. Funny because Battlefield 6 has made a drinking game out of slaughtering vehicles in trailers: those choppers certainly don't seem fit for much besides blowing up. And interesting because it's a quick glimpse into the ever-gripping intricacies of game balancing.</p><p>There is arguably no such thing as "good balance" inasmuch as balancing is an on-going process - developers have to keep adjusting the mixture to keep up with the ingenuity and quirks of clashing groups of players, while hazily targeting some kind of optimal all-round experience. Sirland's aside has made me consider the prospect that developers might deliberately ship a game they consider 'unbalanced' because they're trying to anticipate how player behaviour might evolve. They're trying to balance for how people will be playing in a few month's time, perhaps. A fearful gamble, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Add these insights to EA's longer, official account of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">how they're changing Battlefield 6 based on the beta playtest</a>. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-persistent-servers-and-two-vehicle-heavy-maps-are-coming-in-the-next-labs-playtest">vehicle-heavy maps coming in future Battlefield Labs playtests</a>, so we can get another sense of the curiously variable sponginess of those tanks, which assuredly has nothing to do with the steadiness of my thumbs.</p>
<p>The final game will release on October 10th. The single player story sees the US army trying to save NATO from a rogue PMC, which I think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-make-the-usa-the-villain-in-the-next-call-of-duty-or-battlefield-game">a bit daft</a> given the current US administration's foreign policies.

            <p>Dead Island 3 might not be officially announced, but current series developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a> has given a very serious hint, nod, and wink towards it being in development.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243">Steam</a>, the developer gave a small, but rather obvious hint and what is coming next in the zombie-slaying series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dambuster Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote><p>It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi.</p>
<p>Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p>
<p>This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next.</p>
<p>For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it as far as new information. From the teaser image, which appears to show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Jacob trying to hitch a ride out of LA, we're definitely looking at the next game moving to a new location.</p>
<p>While there's a possibility this tease is for a stand-alone expansion of sorts, similar to Dead Island follow-up, Riptide, it's been two and a half years since Dead Island 2 released and a full titled sequel feels most likely.</p>

<li>There are also a bunch of visual and audio updates (in-game, UI, etc.)</li>



<li>New enemy sound effects and a few extra tracks by Dzivia</li>
</ul>



<p>Update 1.1 also introduces many bug fixes and minor tweaks to the game. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1466060/view/541115924558645329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>. Questline has shared a 20-minute video crafted by YouTuber WolfheartFPS for those who prefer a visual overview.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon launched in late May after a sizable early access period. The game earned itself a decent fanbase on Steam, where it is estimated to have sold between 520K and 645K units. Steam user reviews are also very positive, with an 88% rating. However, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 6.5 out of 10</a> due to some severe bugs:</p>



<p><em>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world that’s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time, once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this patch has solved them.</p>

<p>Introducing the Detective and Viper</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Among Us" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee65c8e5c04b/among-us.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> has received a new update across all platforms this week, bumping it up to Version 17.0.0 and adding two new roles to the game along with various quality of life updates.</p>
<p>The new roles include the Detective and the Viper. Here's a rundown about both roles courtesy of developer Innersloth, along with a look:</p>
<h3>Detective<br></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Keep track of a dead Crewmate’s location, your list of suspects, and what kind of Impostor you’re looking for.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Interrogate:</strong> Start questioning your fellow Crewmates, and find out where they were during the crime!</p>
<p>You can only use the ability on one active case at a time! You’ll need to switch the file if you’re researching multiple murders.</p>
<p>You can change how many Interrogations a Detective can do via the advanced role settings when you’re in the Dropship.</p>
<p>When we made this role, we really wanted to make Emergency Meeting discussions even more fun!</p>
<p>Be careful, though! As you start putting the pieces together, you might be the Impostor’s next target. Make sure to grab a fresh notebook and your magnifying glass — you’re gonna need ’em!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Viper</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>This new Impostor role is perfect for destroying, or in this case, dissolving their victims. Use a well-timed Sabotage to keep the rest of the crew busy while you use your <strong>Acid</strong> ability and watch the Crewmate’s body slowly melt away. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>After a kill, the Crewmate corpse will decay in 3 stages: slightly dissolved, very dissolved, and then just a bone before it’s completely gone.</p>
<p>You can adjust how quickly the corpse dissolves in the advanced role settings in the Dropship.</p>
<p>Before long, the body is gone, and all you have to worry about is your alibi. Time it right and you might achieve the ultimate Impostor dream: killing without leaving any trace of it behind. No one’s going to call an Emergency Meeting when there’s nothing, right?</p>
<p>If you find yourself on the unfortunate end of the Viper’s acidic spit, sadly… this is your end. But at least you’ll be treated to a brand new kill animation before you watch your body start to sizzle.</p>
<p>We had a great time testing these roles and are excited to see how y’all handle these new abilities — whether you become The Skeld’s greatest detective or you just want to go around spitting at other Crewmates (a lil gross, ngl), it’s sure to be a ton of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As for the QoL updates, players can expect updates to the guide settings, role settings, and an improvement to practice mode. There are various other fixes and bugs addressed in this latest update as well.</p>

<p>"It’s a pig, it’s a plane, it’s the Superman DLC"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>To celebrate the recent Superman movie in cinemas, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has received some themed DLC on the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>It gives fans a chance to play as Superman, use his powers like Super Strength and Heat Vision, and take down villains, all while protecting Metropolis. You'll also be able to fly to the Fortress of Solitude to "hang out with Kypto".</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the official Minecraft website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this DLC, Lex Luthor is opening a shelter for lost puppies, providing food, shelter, and love. HA! Of course, that’s not what he’s doing. No, no, no, he’s doing evil stuff, as per usual.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>More specifically, he’s orchestrating a most disturbing scheme, perhaps his most disturbing scheme yet (and there’s not a puppy in sight). But Lex is no fool, he knows that Superman constantly foils his masterplans, so to keep the cape-clad avenger (you) occupied, he’s stirring ruckus in Metropolis so that he can work in peace.</p>
<p>To unravel the mystery and save Metropolis, you'll have to swoosh through the air, punch, beam, and freeze your enemies, crack puzzles, and if you ever need any help, you can always ask <em>Daily Planet</em> intrepid reporter Lois Lane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alongside this paid DLC, there's also a free Superman fan top you can redeem in the game's Dressing Room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Obviously, you want to flaunt and flash the classic Superman “S”, so we’re handing out a free Character Creator item – the Superman fan top! Find it in the Dressing Room and show the world whose side you’re on (NOT Lex Luthor’s!)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates about this, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

                <p>In 2020, a remake of Sega's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/panzer-paladin-review/1900-6417520/" data-ref-id="1900-6417520">Panzer Dragoon</a> was released on modern consoles by Forever Entertainment.

Players assume control of Jaen Jaqeue Lundi, a young man who defies convention by raising and training a dragon named Lagi. The dragon is the players' means of transport and their primary weapon in the game, as Lagi and Jaen face an onslaught of deadly enemies while uncovering secrets of lost civilizations.</p><p>Like the original, Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei: Remake will be a rail shooter. It will also have some modern touches, including branching routes and an evolution of Lagi's powers that depends upon players' performance and play style. Additionally, players can utilize a berserk attack and replay mission variants after the campaign is finished.</p><p>Fans who buy Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei: Remake will have the option of choosing between classic and modern controls. The game will also feature modernized graphics as well as a remastered version of the soundtrack included alongside the original score.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beloved-loser-horse-that-inspired-a-generation-and-an-umamusume-anime-girl-dies.1293159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, I went to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3ly54pyazjk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rave</a> celebrating a series about fleet-footed anime girls based on real-life race horses. Today, the most-beloved of those IRL inspirations, a dismally untalented horse named Haru Urara, died at age 29, which is pretty old for a horse. An incredible number of people – far more than anyone ever would have expected even a scant few months ago – are in mourning.</p><p>The official Twitter account of <em>Umamusume</em>, the aforementioned <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime horse girl sensation</a> that continues to sweep multiple nations, broke the news to fans earlier today.</p><p>“It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away on September 9,” <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1965367711531434346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the account</a>, which has become <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1953800765572632981?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something of a horse death tracker</a> in recent months. “The legendary racehorse's legacy serves as the inspiration for the character of the same name in <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>. We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care.”</p><p>Across social media, fans have come together to celebrate the not-so-mighty mare’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rest in peace, you will forever live in our hearts, our shining hope,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8hotc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one comment on Reddit</a> that’s received thousands of upvotes.</p><p>"I came to [university] to do something I loved and started hating cuz of uni and the competition, and AI is taking the role I am going with," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8jwp8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>. "Haru Urara['s] story gave me a second wind, and I am going ballistic with my side projects and getting myself better. It's because Haru never gave up and enjoyed the run. Losing is never painful if you are enjoying your run. REST IN PEACE Haru Urara."</p><p>Many, many others have shared fan art of Haru Urara’s <em>Umamusume </em>character, including <a href="https://x.com/LuisArreol33565/status/1965370342681313323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an image of her being reunited</a> with other in-game characters whose IRL inspirations have passed.</p><p>Race horses are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/15/medina-spirit-scandal-horse-abuse-bob-baffert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated about as well as the dirt they run on</a>, and this goes double for those who underperform. The story of Haru Urara’s career ranks among the saddest; before she retired in 2004, she lost every single one of her 113 races.&nbsp;</p><p>"Race horses are destroyed when they don't win," Haru Urara’s former trainer, Dai Muneishi, <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/horse-that-never-wins-has-become-the-toast-of-japan-2459872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Scotsman</a> in 2004 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/millions-of-gamers-on-steam-and-beyond-gather-to-mourn-famously-untalented-horse-who-inspired-the-beloved-anime-girl-in-umamusume-haru-urara-may-she-get-all-the-grass-and-carrots-in-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamesradar</a>). "But to my way of thinking, a horse is also a living being, and it's inexcusable to destroy it at the mere whim of humans."</p><p>Muneishi also described Haru Urara as “physically small” and fearful of other horses. As a result, training her to race was an ordeal.</p><p>The tide began to turn for Haru Urara in 2003, at the tail end of her time on the tracks, when Japanese media took notice of her unlikely record, which then stood at a mere 80 consecutive losses. That sudden surge in popularity saved her life; in 2003 her then-owner <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/asia-travel/japan/horse-on-losing-trot-could-be-worlds-worst-lh9p86fnjbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Times</a> that she’d been on a collision course with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the knacker’s yard</a> prior to that point.&nbsp;</p><p>At the peak of her fame in 2004, Haru Urara was dubbed “the shining star of losers everywhere” and lured 13,000 spectators out to the Kochi Racetrack in Kochi, Japan where, despite being ridden by Japan's top jockey, Yutaka Take, she lost her 106th race.</p><p>At the time, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3558275.stm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Japanese television ran footage of the race, focusing on the mare with her trademark pink "Hello Kitty" hood.</p><p>"All the fans seem to be going home happy," a reporter covering for Asahi TV said.</p><p>"They feel that it was OK for her to lose."</p><p>Correspondents say Haru Urara, the eternal loser who does not give up, has struck a chord with those Japanese who have lost most during the past decade of economic stagnation and job losses.</p><p>Her spectacular lack of success is also proving as profitable as it is inspirational. Kochi racecourse, nearly bankrupt, has seen its revenues shoot up.</p><p>Others are also cashing in with "Haru" tours, t-shirts, good luck charms said to contain a hair from her tail, books, and postage stamps. There is a pop song about her and a movie is in the works.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Haru Urara’s career <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9#CITEREF%E9%80%B1%E5%88%8A%E6%96%B0%E6%BD%AE2008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> with a dispute between her trainer, owner, and others about whether she remained fit to race – along with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1mn9uuj/untold_stories_of_haru_urara_you_will_barely_find/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation</a> about involved parties attempting to squeeze another financial windfall out of her – after which she spent the next handful of years involved in her owner’s therapy and education efforts. There were also plans to breed her with other famous Japanese horses, but they never fully materialized. Eventually, in 2013, ownership of Haru Urara was transferred to Matha Farm in Japan’s Chiba prefecture, where she lived out the remainder of her days.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Umamusume</em>’s take on Haru Urara, a pink-haired anime girl with a legion of in-game fans despite her penchant for losing, exposed the ancient race horse to a new audience. Her story resonated with younger people in the West as well. Earlier this year, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/anime-horse-girls-are-causing-one-real-life-mare-dubbed-the-shining-star-of-losers-everywhere-to-receive-so-much-usd40-grass-she-broke-the-donation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashed a website</a> that let them donate $40 ryegrass gifts to her. In the end, <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the website</a>, fans donated a total grass amount of 3,410 kg, or 7,518 lbs. That is too much for one horse to eat, but I’m sure Haru Urara appreciated it on some level.</p><p>Haru Urara <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died of colic</a>, a form of gas build up that is often deadly to horses, but was apparently healthy up to that point. I find it difficult not to feel a little weird about a situation in which an animal suffered to make money for a bunch of different people, only to be declared an inspiration for never giving up despite <em>her </em>apparent desire to be doing anything else – and then a lot of other people became parasocially attached to an anime girl, further obscuring, at least in some cases, the wants and needs of real animals trapped in a broken system. But it sounds like Haru Urara lived out her final years in peace, and that’s better than nothing.</p><p>"One of these beautiful tragedies," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd92he3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comment</a> on the <em>Umamusume </em>subreddit. "We didn't expect it so soon, but our gal made it to 29 years old. Lived the last of them in absolute luxury and love."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Oh boy, it's time for another instalment of<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What I Do, our regular feature showcasing just what it is that individuals across the video game industry actually do for a living</a>.</p><p>This week we've got Michal Napora, someone who has done not one job recently, but two. And while both have something <em>broadly </em>to do with selling video games, they're also different enough to count as two hats, which is a lot of hats to be wearing in video games in 2025.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey man, thanks for taking the time to chat with us today. Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Who you are, how you got your start in games, that kinda stuff.</strong></p><p><strong>Michal Napora</strong>: Hi! My name is Michal and I’m the founder of video games publisher UNIKAT Label and video games marketing agency 32-33. I’ve been in the video games industry for around 12 years. I got my first taste of game marketing in my town of Perth, Western Australia, where I helped a local indie crew Gnomic Studio with their game <em>Square Heroes</em>. Totally new and absolutely naive, I tried to spread the word on this full-of-heart indie shooter while finishing off my Masters in Marketing. Once I graduated, I shot my shot and applied for a Social Media Manager role at a Polish studio called Techland. They were working on an upcoming AAA zombie horror game called <em>Dying Light</em>. A few weeks after I applied, I had a call with them. Then another. And another. Finally, a few weeks after the application was sent, they offered me a job. So I packed my bags, said goodbyes, and moved from Perth to Europe and worked on <em>Dying Light</em>. During the two years I was there, I learned a TON. My brain was a sponge, soaking it all in. It was fun, and at times stressful, surrounded by beautiful, intelligent, and insanely talented people. When the game came out and received praise (as well as social and press clout), it felt like<a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/borussia-dortmund-champions-league-finalists-2013-where-are-they-now-lewandowski-klopp-27291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we were the 2012/2013 Borussia Dortmund team - a bunch of young up-and-comers that reached the Champions League final</a>.</p><p>After two years working at Techland, I decided to do something of my own, and that’s how my boutique marketing agency 32-33 came to be. Throughout my time at 32-33, I am fortunate to count some great clients: teams such as Frogwares (<em>The Sinking City</em>, <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> series), Bloober Team (<em>The Medium</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em> on Switch), indies such as <em>Dinkum</em>, <em>Bramble: The Mountain King</em>, <em>Medieval Dynasty</em>, <em>Squirrel With a Gun</em>, and loads, loads more. Working on a variety of projects with people from all over the world is such a cool experience. It made me realise that we as people, we are all the same - we want the same things, we have similar interests, and similar loves. It’s a nice feeling to work with like-minded individuals.</p><p>And as of April last year, I started my own publishing house called UNIKAT Label. I believe it could be the first video games publisher from Perth. Our first two games were <em>POOLS</em> and <em>Dystopika</em>, and once again, I am feeling privileged that I got to work with some seriously talented people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: If you can sum it up as neatly as a business card (or two business cards) allows, what's your exact job title?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Technically, I am a Founder. Or the hated-by-me title of CEO. Which feels too damn corporate. Founder is good.</p><p><strong>LP: So what does that involve, exactly? Like on a daily basis, and then more strategically, what is it that you do for a living across two jobs?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: As someone who runs a publisher and a marketing agency, I do a lot of varied things. At the start of each week, I plan out a list of tasks that I need to accomplish for the next 4-5 days. And as I am looking at my board, talking with people is my number one task - be it on Discord, on calls, or via email. I talk to my partner and fellow people that I work with, developers that I work with, my clients, journalists, events custodians, content creators, first and third parties (just a fancy industry term that describes companies like Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Unreal, Unity, etc) and other people who are in our industry. Talking is something that I do a lot. So plan and talk.&nbsp;</p><p>Next is doing the actual work - be it writing press releases, applying for events, finalising events that I am organising myself, think about social content, and plan out marketing activities. Planning out marketing campaigns is something I enjoy a lot. I also like to take time for myself and that’s when I usually like to think through what worked well in the week, what didn’t, lessons that I should take on board and stuff to watch out for. It’s also a time when I like to look at the long term vision of what UNIKAT is all about. Thinking, reflecting, and writing in a journal really helps me out. Getting stuff out of your head into the physical world helps clear up that head and gives you space for new ideas to come out. Otherwise, stuff just ferments.&nbsp;</p><p>Reading the net - scouring it. Be it for games, opportunities, or information is something that’s on my card too. I like going down rabbit holes and coming across different communities of people. In general, I feel I have a very varied line of work. It’s fun and always keeps you engaged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: On your best day, what's the best thing about your job?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Meeting people. I am a bit of a cheerful introvert who likes to talk. I do like the comfort of my desk and being silent when I work, but talking with people does bring a bit of a smile to my face. I have to say that about 93% of the people in our industry are fantastic people - full of charm, good energy and just want to make games. The other 7% are leeches, but you do start getting a feeling for them after some time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also like the feeling of all of our hard work coming together and culminating to one specific point - be it an announcement of a new game, a demo drop, being part of an event. Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling. And game release days are pretty special too. There is this quiet freeing point; the moment you hit release until you start seeing responses from the market is a real high - it’s like jumping out of a plane without a parachute and waiting for stuff to happen. The limbo zone. Will people like it? Will people buy it? Will it do well? That feeling of being out but not having the answers yet is sooo freeing. You don’t know what to do, or which way things will go. The reality of the situation hasn’t hit yet. I always get my heart pumping in this spot. It doesn’t last long, as answers usually come pretty soon. And once answers come through, reality hits - be it good or bad. You have a direction of what to do next. You need to plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But actually, as I am typing this, the best thing to see is seeing developers happy with your and their work. It’s cheesy as fuck when I am typing this, but it’s soooo damn cool seeing devs, especially first time devs, tasting success. It reminds me of how I felt at the start as well. Seeing people lose their minds because their game is trending and featured on Steam’s front page is a wicked happy feeling - like being at a rave, you’re feeling ultra happy, the future looks optimistic, and time slows down. That’s also a very nice feeling (and the opposite of that kinda sucks).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pools - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AFoK14RMJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>LP: Conversely, what do you think are some of the biggest challenges you see facing over the next few years? Whether that's yourself, your business or just video games in general.</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Discoverability. The amount of games being made and pumped out is staggering. And I’m not just talking about the bad or even average ones. There are a lot of good games being made these days. It’s a fantastic position for gamers, as they get to play some amazing gems. However, for people making them, it’s harder and harder to get noticed. There is a lot of competition for eyeballs, be it press eyeballs, content creators, heck, even on Steam itself. We like to say that indies don’t compete with themselves, but they kinda do. We don’t compete for sales, we compete for attention. Some content creators get over 30 “play my game” emails a day. And I would imagine Aftermath gets their fair share of press releases too. And it’s physically impossible for you to publish all of the news. I feel that the massive amount of recent industry layoffs will create a batch of new micro-studios that will have some amazing games to show off. It’ll also mean that a lot of developers, be it big or small, will need to re-adjust their expectations when it comes to sales. And indie devs will need to face the reality of how good their projects really are. I feel a bit of a reckoning is coming. I’m really keen to see where this goes.</p><p>On the “market watch” side, I feel that with people having less and less disposable income (especially in Western countries), it’s the cheaper games that will be winners. Just like social media content, people are ok with dropping small amounts for fleeting game experiences. Play, laugh, move on. Friendslop is a good example of this. I feel that a bit of Friendsloppification might start filtering through to other genres - city builders, narrative games, shooters. Cheaper games that offer a cool experience that can be consumed within a few sessions and we “swipe up”/move on. Will AAAs die off? Probably not. There is definitely space for them too (<em>GTA VI</em> is going to kill it, looks like <em>Battlefield 6</em> will too). But games in the $30 to $50 USD price point might struggle a bit. Imagine trying to sell a $49 7/10 game now? Of course, I could be completely wrong and by 2026 the economies of the world will be roaring and we’re all going to have cash coming out of our whazoos. That actually would be cool. Let’s hope that this is what will happen. However, my pessimistic side doesn’t think it will, and that’s when all of the 7/10 and less games or games not fit for market will suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Any final shout outs you'd want to give before we wrap this up?</strong><strong>MN</strong>: Huge, HUGE shoutouts to all the people I’ve met along the way! There’s too many to list individually, but looking back, definitely a huge shoutout to the Techland <em>Dying Light</em> and <em>Dying Light: The Following</em> crew. Lots of great memories there. Also a huge thanks to all of the devs and publishers I’ve worked with over the years. Thank you so much for the trust and for letting me play and market your games. Finally, to the industry, perhaps I would say let’s not be so goddamn short-term focused. It’s ok if things slow down a bit. Just think of the long-term vision, what it does to your studio and to your studio’s name. It’s ok to wait a bit to see good results. Hypercapitalism is leading to burnout, not just of people within the industry, but players too. It’s alright to slow down. Pat a cat. Or a duck. Let’s slow it down a notch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve
