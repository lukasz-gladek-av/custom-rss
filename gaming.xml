Inspired by this idea, <em>CASSETTE BOY</em> introduces the unique “Schrodinger System,” where objects outside of your view simply vanish from the world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At first glance, the visuals may resemble classic pixel art. In reality, the entire game is built in 3D. By rotating the camera and shifting perspectives, players solve puzzles in entirely new ways. For example, if an object is hidden behind a wall and you cannot see it, it no longer exists. Obstacles such as NPCs, monsters, arrows you’ve fired, or even bombs can disappear simply by changing your viewpoint—opening the path forward.</p><p>Classic-looking pixel art and familiar puzzle tropes are given surprising twists. In this world, puzzles cannot be solved in the “usual” way.</p><p>It looks retro, yet feels brand new—an innovative puzzle RPG born from the fusion of retro style and quantum-inspired mechanics.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cassette-boy-adds-xbox-series-ps4-and-xbox-one-versions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A demo of <em>Itachi: Haunted Abodes – Wandering Through 2000s Tokyo Culture</em> will be playable at the room6 booth at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which will run from September 25 to 28 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. Stickers will also be distributed to those who add the game to their wishlist.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Itachi: Hunted Abodes</em> is a paranormal suspense adventure that has you wandering through 2000s Tokyo’s subculture scenes!</p><p><strong>A Paranormal Subculture Story Starting with a Stigmatized Property</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to early 2000s Tokyo.</p><p>Meet Itachi, a college student without a place to stay. He finds a part-time job that provides him a house… specifically, a stigmatized property. That is, a house with a dark past.</p><p>No experience is needed, all expenses are paid for, and all that’s required of him is to live in the house, normally, for a week. And he gets paid quite well for it, too.</p><p>The only slightly annoying thing is that he has to live with Tanuki, an employee from the real estate company giving him this job.</p><p>Well, there’s one more “slightly annoying” thing. What he doesn’t know is that he was actually hired to be a lure for “Landgods,” a type of spectre haunting the houses of those who died away from their hometown.</p><p>The idea is to drive these Landgods away so that the house can be sold safely… regardless of what happens to Itachi in the process.</p><p>Join “weasel” Itachi and “raccoon dog” Tanuki in this adventure through Tokyo’s subculture scenes.</p><p>Your own job? Finding clues on the previous tenant’s untimely death.</p><p><strong>Two Opposite Perspectives</strong></p><p>During the investigation parts, you’ll be able to switch between Itachi’s and Tanuki’s points of view. Itachi is just a normal human being who can’t even see the Landgods, but he’s great at talking to people. Band followers, girls in maid costumes—he could make anyone spill the beans.</p><p>Tanuki’s not so good with people, but he can see the Landgods. He can stop their attacks to collect information directly from them.</p><p>Only by combining these two opposite perspectives will you be able to see the whole truth.</p><p>Itachi’s job is to live in that creepy apartment, but he won’t be spending the whole day there. Go on a trip through Tokyo, looking for hints in the most disparate subculture scenes.</p><p>Live music clubs with visual-kei bands? Check.</p><p>Maid cafés where everything is cutesy to a fault? Check.</p><p>Harajuku and its frilly, over-the-top fashion? Check.</p><p>Go back in history, explore these unique 2000s scenes, and you might find the dark secrets you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Send Those Monsters Back to Their Land</strong></p><p>Once you have enough information, Tanuki can start a ritual to exorcise the Landgods back to where they came from.</p><p>You’ll need to show them that you know who they are: their name, their place of origin, and the cause of death of the person they followed to this house.</p><p>Use all the information you have to complete the ritual, but be careful… If you make too many mistakes, Itachi is the one who’ll pay for it.</p><p><strong>The Abodes You’ll Visit</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sudden Bassist Death Syndrome</strong> – What do the visual-kei groupies know?</li><li><strong>A Maid Made to Die</strong> – Not all of this maid’s secrets were so cute.</li><li><strong>Workaholics Anonymous</strong> – Why work when you can play dress up in Harajuku?</li><li><strong>Baggage From Home</strong> – Uncover an old grudge with the goths’ help.</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/paranormal-suspense-adventure-game-itachi-haunted-abodes-wandering-through-2000s-tokyo-culture-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-wants-you-to-ditch-your-old-laptop-and-upgrade-to-the-new-macbook-air-at-a-record-low-2000627500</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-wants-you-to-ditch-your-old-laptop-and-upgrade-to-the-new-macbook-air-at-a-record-low.1303956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s latest MacBook Air (launched in March) has been among the company’s most popular laptops for some time now, but price has usually been the stumbling block. On Apple’s website, this MacBook Air with the M4 chip in its base configuration (16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage) starts at $999.</p>
<p>But today, Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">knocked everyone back by lowering the very same model to an all-time low price of $799</a>. It includes the same warranty, the same box-fresh product and even more convenient delivery and return arrangements.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Lightest MacBook Just Got Serious Power</h2>
<p>The new M4 chip is at the heart of it and brings faster performance across the board. For everyday use, it makes juggling multiple apps smoother and faster. But it also goes into denser ground like photo and video editing or even graphics-intensive games. On top of that, Apple’s new Intelligence features which rely on the M4 to make writing assistance, automating operations and privacy-first AI capabilities possible.</p>



<p>While the performance boost is significant, design is still focused on portability: Winging in at over 2.7 pounds and under half an inch thick, this MacBook Air is meant to slide into a bag and almost disappear until you need it. Battery life is another bonus with up to 18 hours on one charge. That means you really can make it through a whole workday without having to plug in. It still has the same MagSafe charging port that’s so fashionable again, plus two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 support. For extreme users, you can even connect up to two external monitors.</p>
<p>The screen is also somewhere where the Air does better than you might guess at this price: The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen displays a billion colors and has amazing brightness and contrast. Text is razor-sharp for everyday use like reading and writing. But when streaming TV shows or looking at photos, the color accuracy is actually superb.</p>
<p>Apple has also put major work into the camera and audio system, changes that are more vital than ever with so much of life happening on video calls. The 12MP camera with Center Stage keeps you centered and properly focused and the three-microphone array ensures voices sound loud and clear. Four built-in speakers handle audio with support for Spatial Audio, and thus music or conference calls can sound surprisingly immersive.</p>
<p>What should seal the deal for many is the value angle. At $999, the MacBook Air M4 is already positioned as Apple’s most balanced machine between performance and portability. But at $799 on Amazon, you’re essentially getting premium performance, build quality, and the ecosystem advantages of macOS at a price that undercuts many Windows ultrabooks with weaker specs. Throw in Amazon’s delivery speed and return policy, and it’s difficult to argue full price up front from Apple’s website at this point.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air has long had the reputation of being the Mac for everyday use. With the M4 chip now inside and a historic price cut dropping it under $800, the 2025 MacBook Air feels like a golden moment for upgrading.</p>

              <p>One of Apple’s most practical products is not a MacBook or an iPhone. It’s something much smaller that addresses a headache just about everyone experiences: losing things. Apple’s AirTag has become an international best-seller because it makes keeping track of your things so easy, whether that’s your keys, your suitcases while traveling or even your kid’s backpack at school.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has an all-time-low deal with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">single AirTag dropping to just $21 (down from $29)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">the 4-pack decreasing to $74 (normally $99)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AirTags Are the Everyday Fix You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
<p>If you have ever spent mornings searching for your keys or nervously hoped your suitcase made it onto the right plane, AirTags can make your life a lot easier. The technology that goes into them is really cool for devices so tiny. <strong>All AirTags use Apple’s Find My network which taps into hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the globe</strong>. You’re not just using your phone by itself to locate your item, then – there’s an entire crowd-sourced network trying to help you locate it. And in everyday use, it functions with incredible accuracy.</p>



<p>It doesn’t get much simpler to set one up. Place the AirTag alongside your iPhone or iPad, tap once as prompted, and it’s set. Then you can attach it to whatever you need to track. Most begin with wallets, keys or bags, but you’ll find many creative uses. Parents have been known to attach one to a child’s school bag, travelers place one in checked luggage and some even attach them to expensive gear or bikes for extra security. Because the AirTag itself is just over an inch in diameter and weighs only 0.39 ounces, it never feels obtrusive or out of place.</p>
<p>An individual AirTag uses a standard CR2032 coin battery that will survive for about a year before you’ll want to replace it. That means you won’t need to stress about charging it constantly unlike so many other intelligent gadgets. The AirTag also has an IP67 water and dust resistance rating so it will be okay if it’s caught in the rain or dropped in a puddle. For iPhone 11 and later users, Precision Finding uses ultra-wideband technology to give you on-screen arrows and even haptic feedback to guide you to your lost item, which offers you the exact direction and distance to it.</p>
<p>Amazon’s discount makes them even more appealing. One AirTag available for $21 lets you get your foot in the door for not a lot. But the best deal is the 4-pack for $74, which comes out to just over $18 per tag. Considering how many items in your life that could use a bit of an extra safety net, more than one is easily worth it.</p>

            <p>Konami wants your opinion on which Metal Gear game you think should get the remake treatment next.</p>
<p>In a new survey entitled "Metal Gear – Production Hotline at TGS2025 Post-viewing survey", the publisher asked a number of questions about how it communicates with fans, but most interestingly, it also polls players for information about which Metal Gear titles they'd like to see "remade".</p>

<p>The options provided on the survey included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>
<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriot</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also a text box inviting "other" suggestions, too, so if you've a burning desire to see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> remade, you'll have to pop it in there (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">InsiderGaming</a>).</p>
<p>Expect more at the next Metal Gear Production Hotline livestream, scheduled for 25th September (which just so happens to be the launch date of the next instalment of Konami's other big franchise, Silent Hill).</p> <div>

            <p>A trophy list for a PS4 version of 2007's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-anniversary">Tomb Raider: Anniversary</a> has popped up online.</p>
<p>While we've heard nothing official about a Tomb Raider: Anniversary re-release – let alone confirmation of a third remastered collection – the achievements are available on the PlayStation trophy tracking site, <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/trophies">True Trophies</a>.</p>

<p>Odds are, however, this is probably just a port rather than the next instalment of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-review">Aspyr's remaster efforts</a>, not least because there are substantially fewer trophies than we would expect from a modern remaster, and as the redditor who spotted the leak <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/anniversary_leaked_for_ps4/">posits</a>, we'd probably see trophies for Legend and Underworld, too, if Anniversary was part of wider collection.</p><p>As the OP <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/comment/nfe1z1i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">explains</a> it, "the style of this leaked list tracks with other games released for Sony’s classics catalogue, e.g. the small number of trophies and the design of the images. If it were Saber’s remaster, it would likely have a large, expansive list of things to do, and the images would be in the same style as TR1-6 were".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/anniversary_leaked_for_ps4/">Anniversary leaked for PS4</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VeldinX/">u/VeldinX</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/">TombRaider</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>That doesn't mean Aspyr <em>isn't</em> working on a new remastered collection, of course, only that this probably isn't it. We'll probably find out for sure one way or the other soon, though.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider is one of the most storied franchises in gaming history. Debuting almost 30 years ago, Lara Croft's first adventure was one of the pioneers of early 3D gaming, and turned the fearless explorer into an instant icon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Here's how to play the entire Tomb Raider franchise in order</a>, either by release or chronological date.</p><p>Françoise Cadol, the actor who voiced the French version of Lara Croft in all of Tomb Raider games from their inception to 2008, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-lara-croft-taking-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-ai-generated-voice-use-in-tomb-raider-remasters">recently revealed she was taking legal action against Aspyr Media for the apparent AI-generated use of her voice</a> in the Tomb Raider 4-6 remasters.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/jsaux-all-in-one-carry-case-for-switch-2-rugged-robust-and-just-really-good</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-jsaux-all-in-one-carry-case-for-switch-2-rugged-robust-and-just-really-good.1303821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="JSAUX All-In-One Carry Case 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5356c1cb675a6/jsaux-all-in-one-carry-case-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many folks, a basic case — much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">Nintendo’s own official offering</a> — to house the Switch 2 in its handheld configuration will likely be enough for general day-to-day use. But for instances in which you might need to haul everything from the dock to the Pro Controller out and about, an ‘all-in-one’ option might be preferable.</p>
<p>Nintendo offers its own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-gives-us-a-closer-look-at-switch-2s-all-in-one-carrying-case">all-in-one case</a>, but at <strong>£64.99 / $84.99</strong>, its price might be a little hard to stomach. JSAUX undercuts this significantly with its own variant priced at <strong>£29.99 / $37.99</strong>, and considering how much you’re saving here, it’s genuinely difficult to find much to fault.</p>

<p>JSAUX’s case contains two main compartments separated by two dual zips. The one at the top houses your Switch 2, with ten slots available for your cartridges underneath, and a velcro strap to keep your console nice and secure. The bottom compartment is for everything else: your dock, Pro Controller, cables, Joy-Con grip – basically everything you might consider ‘the essentials’.</p>
<p>By default, the lower compartment is separated into sections, with two larger slots in the centre, and one smaller section on each side. What became immediately apparent, however, is that the dividers separating the sections are held together by velcro.</p>
<p>Hold up now, that’s a good thing! It means you can essentially customise the way in which you store your Switch 2 accessories if you’re not quite happy with the default setup.</p>

<p>Granted, there are only so many ways in which the sections actually fit together, but if you have an accessory that’s of particularly high value, then you can always just alter the dividers slightly so that it fits a bit more snugly, preventing excessive movement when you’re carrying it around.</p>
<p>Even if you do happen to drop this thing, though, you’re unlikely to damage anything. The larger flat surfaces only cave ever-so-slightly under pressure, and the corners in particular are absolutely rock solid. You could probably chuck this thing down a flight of stairs and it wouldn’t harm the case itself or anything contained within. I still wouldn’t recommend doing so, of course, but accidents happen, y’know?</p>

<p>Hopefully you won’t be dropping anything, mind you, since the case comes with its own handle. Alternatively, you could opt for the shoulder strap. Naturally, its length is adjustable, so you can have it so that the case hangs just low enough for you to keep it secure with your hand or forearm. As a bonus, the case itself is also scratch resistant and water resistant, so no worries if you're out in the rain or if you happen to have a particularly feisty cat skulking around.</p>
<p>If you’re after something robust, yet affordable, JSAUX’s all-in-one case ticks all the right boxes. If I had to find something to nitpick, I’d say that it’s lacking a bit of visual flair; nothing much is needed here, but I do like how the official case from Nintendo has those coloured zip rings, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you probably don’t want something that’s going to draw attention when you’re lugging this around a busy train station, or something.</p>

            <p>Lenovo has confirmed that whilst Legion Go 2 units are now making their way to "major retailers globally", some pre-orders placed on Lenovo's very own website will "need" to be cancelled.</p>
<p>The company did not confirm how many pre-orders have been affected, but said it was "truly sorry for the inconvenience it has caused".</p>

<p>"[W]e will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com," the company said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/were_the_lenovo_legion_team_ask_us_anything_about/">in a post on Reddit</a>. "We don’t believe in holding onto customer payments for products we can’t ship in a timely manner. As soon as our online inventory is replenished, Lenovo.com will show updated availability and ordering will reopen.</p><p>"We know this is frustrating, and we’re truly sorry for the inconvenience it caused, especially for our most passionate fans. The Legion Go Gen 2 was built with you in mind, and this experience has been an important lesson for us. We'll use this to improve and ensure a better process moving forward."</p>
<p>Lenovo states pre-orders "substantially exceeded our projections, leading to unforeseen delivery range extensions". It says it's "working diligently with our teams worldwide to fill these orders as quickly as possible. We truly appreciate the overwhelming support of Legion fans, and ask for your patience while we work to get the Legion Go Gen 2 into your waiting hands".</p>
<p>Dozens of unhappy customers have responded to the statement, some asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf2owd3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">why Lenovo is prioritising customers who placed orders with third-party retailers</a> rather than those who pre-ordered directly with the tech company, and questioning why there's been no compensation for players who paid thousands of dollars months ago, only to find their orders now cancelled. Others say that if their order is not fulfilled, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf3xg7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">they "won't buy [from Lenovo] at all"</a>.</p>
<p>"You can't just state some orders will be cancelled and ride back off into the sunset, state which ones and why! If it's to do with discount codes say so," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/nf3xg7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">commented</a> one unhappy pre-orderer. "There's NO reason to cancel someone's order who is willing to wait other than you don't like the price they paid for it. 'We don’t believe in holding onto customer payments' is a very weak excuse.</p>
<p>"If mine is cancelled, it will be the last straw and I won't buy it at all, a competitor benefits instead. I won't wait around constantly checking for a window of opportunity to order again."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear how long the delay will be for those prepared to wait but Lenovo admitted it had "messed up this time but we promise we’ll move forward with a lot more caution and care because that’s what you, our awesome community, deserves".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lenovo-unveils-legion-go-2-and-go-s-handheld-gaming-pcs-including-steamos-model">Lenovo's second-generation handheld gaming PC Legion Go 2 was announced back in January</a>. Alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers, it sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. You can also boost the spec up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a few days after the debut of Dying Light: The Beast, and without even needing Techland to share the official mod tools, Nexus Mods already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/dyinglightthebeast/mods?sort=endorsements&amp;excludedTag=Translation&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosts</a> 121 mods for the first-person open world action gam<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/dyinglightthebeast/mods?sort=endorsements&amp;excludedTag=Translation&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a>. Some of them actually manage to greatly improve the game in a few key areas. In this article, we'll recommend five in particular.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLTB Retouched</a></strong> - Nexus Mods user aethersquared focused on quality of life enhancements in this mod, which delivers a rework of stamina usage. Its consumption has been slightly reduced and stamina regeneration has been increased. Furthermore, the stamina usage of some combat skills, such as the iconic dropkick, has been halved to encourage a more aggressive playstyle, and the dropkick is also usable in Beast Mode. The main character, Kyle Crane (who returns from the original Dying Light title), now takes longer to get oily/sweaty hands when parkouring. The size of the dot crosshair has been reduced to make it more immersive. The Field of View (FoV) will no longer temporarily increase just when dashing, and you can dash when swimming, making water traversal a bit faster. Lastly, dismantling items is quicker.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>VAXIS's Dumber Zombies</strong></a> - If you played a little of Dying Light: The Beast, you probably noticed that even regular zombies somehow have a sixth sense when it comes to locating your character, and that's even when you are crouching to be more stealthy. With this mod, their perception is lowered and they will also take longer to recognize you as a threat to attack. This affects only basic zombies, not special zombies.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Zombie Grab Range Reducer</strong></a> - Another gameplay aspect that irked me right away in the game was that every zombie seems capable of grabbing Kyle Crane with ease and even at a fair distance. This mod, created by Fr4nsson, lets you reduce the range from the vanilla 1.7 meters to 1.3 meters, 1.0 meters, or even disable grabbing outright. I wouldn't recommend the latter option, though. Some grabbing makes sense, but only if they really get close.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Better Beast Mode</strong></a> - One of the main additions of this new installment (it's in the title, after all) is a little underwhelming by default, but can get a lot better with this mod by starkillercrane55, which fills up the meter faster, hits enemies faster (while in the mode), increases jump height and makes the grappling hook go faster. Critically, Beast Mode now takes much longer to end without hitting enemies or manually stopping.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More Repairs</a></strong> - As suggested by the title, this mod created by Phobi666 greatly increases the amount of maximum repairs you can perform on an item within a particular rarity. White and green weapons can now be repaired 10 times, blue 20, violet 25, orange 35, and platinum/exotic weapons have infinite repairs. Limited weapons are unaffected.</li>
</ol>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast shines the most when playing in co-op with some friends. As such, there is actually a bonus mod to recommend: Synsteric's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Online with Mods</a>', which disables the multiplayer CRC check to make mods work in co-op mode.</p>



<p>If you're on the fence about Techland's new game, you can read David Carcasole's review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a> is back next week in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a>, and ahead of the big launch, the game's Japanese website has shared an official comparison chart.</p>
<p>It shows how the game will perform and look on the Switch and Switch 2. So here's what you can expect for both platforms in terms of the quality and performance modes:</p>
<h3><strong>Switch 2:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Quality priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV Mode: 3840 x 2160p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>"Maximum" 30fps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Frame rate priority):</strong></p>

<li>TV Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>60fps</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switch</h3>
<p><strong>Resolution &amp; Frame Rate (Quality priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TV mode: 1920 x 1080p</li>
<li>Handheld Mode: 1280 x 720p</li>

<li>Handheld Mode: 1024 x 576</li>
<li>30fps</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Going All In, Selling the New AirPods Pro 3 Cheaper Than Apple]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-going-all-in-selling-the-new-airpods-pro-3-cheaper-than-apple-2000627489</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-going-all-in-selling-the-new-airpods-pro-3-cheaper-than-apple.1303770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple introduced the new iPhone 17 and AirPods Pro 3 just a few days ago, and even though they are available only from Friday, something totally absurd is happening: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon of is now offering the AirPods Pro 3 at $239, which is $10 lower than Apple’s current offering</a>. This kind of day-one price reduction by Amazon is unheard of and it’s mind-blowing to see this kind of thing occur so rapidly with brand-new materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Better Sound with Clever Features</h2>
<p>These AirPods Pro 3 offer what is perhaps some of the <strong>best in-ear active noise cancellation available on the market</strong>. Apple has raised the stakes with a guarantee to <strong>cut out twice as much extraneous noise as the AirPods Pro 2</strong> so when you’re listening with them, you’re fully immersed in your music (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-review-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-not-where-it-has-been-2000658726">check out the AirPods Pro 3 review at Gizmodo here</a>). It’s not just about noise-blocking, though – they’ve completely rebooted the sound experience. The <strong>3D spatial sound creates this amazing depth</strong> where you can clearly hear every instrument, the bass is more complete and vocals are heard in glorious detail.</p>
<p>And then <strong>there’s the heart rate sensor</strong>. Yes, these earbuds don’t only pump sound; they track your heart rate and calories burned during any of up to 50 different workouts. Coupled with the fitness capabilities of your iPhone, including the Move ring and new Workout Buddy, you’ve got a dead serious personal trainer in your ears. Cool, right?</p>



<p><strong>Live translation</strong> is fueled by Apple Intelligence and it’s another doozy: That equates to being able to overcome language barriers in real time when you’re chatting with friends or traveling abroad. The feature is intelligent and effortless so conversation is like you shared the same language.</p>
<p>Battery life is also excellent as you can listen<strong> for 8 hours with Active Noise Cancellation on</strong>, and 10 hours when you’re listening with Transparency mode enabled with Hearing Aid. And<strong> new ear tips come in five sizes</strong> so you can find your best fit for yourself, with them staying put and sound even better.</p>
<p>With these changes in mind, it’s incredible to think that Amazon is offering them for less than Apple charges. If this combination of features and this price is sounding like a deal too good to resist, that’s because it is. Don’t wait too long – this sale doesn’t last forever.</p>

              <p>Small power banks normally only do as much as charging up phones, and that’s it. However, if you want a small charger that also can charge your laptop,<strong> this Ugreen 145W 25,000mAh model is something to consider</strong>. It’s rather revolutionary in its segment and is being sold in store on Amazon as an early Prime Day deal: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4212/">it’s dropping to an all-time low price of $66, down from $99</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4212/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Powerhouse with Laptop-Level Charging</h2>
<p>Ugreen’s power bank doesn’t just handle phones but it also tackles laptops and other high-demand devices with ease. Equipped with a <strong>massive 25,000mAh battery</strong>, it offers enough juice to fully recharge laptops about 1.3 times and phones up to 5.2 times.</p>



<p>What distinguishes the model is its <strong>turbo-speed 145W charging through PD3.1 and QC3.0 technology</strong>. Standout is the USB-C1 port, which has a capacity of up to 140W. That equates to charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 56% in 30 minutes which is a quick pace for a portable charger. Besides that, there is two-way fast charging, meaning with a 65W or higher charger, you can easily top-up the power bank itself in roughly 2 hours.</p>
<p>The convenience factor is also very high with a very slim and light weight design that can be <strong>carried in any backpack or even a large pocket</strong>. There is a digital showing that displays the battery level clearly, so you will never be left stranded by low power at a critical time.</p>
<p>For $66 on Amazon with a 34% discount, it’s an all-time low price for a portable charger with serious power without serious bulk.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/3x-cheaper-than-apple-headphones-this-hp-laptop-with-windows-11-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000627472</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3x-cheaper-than-apple-headphones-this-hp-laptop-with-windows-11-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1303743/</guid>

              <p>With hundreds of laptops available today, it almost feels like there’s one model for every person out there. But if you’re working with a tighter budget and don’t want to settle for a Chromebook without Windows, there’s a solid option to consider: This HP 14-inch laptop (64GB storage) is packing Windows 11 Home and ranks among the top 5 bestsellers on Amazon—and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">it’s hitting its lowest price for a Windows laptop we’ve seen at $171, down from $229</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Budget Windows Laptop for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>It has a razor-thin and light design along with a <strong>14-inch HD micro-edge bezel display of only 6.5mm</strong> and provides an immersive viewing experience with a 79% screen-to-body ratio. That is, you are nearly entirely viewing screen when you look at it which is ideal if you want a laptop that is up-to-date in terms of appearance without the clunky body. The 1366×768 screen resolution offers sharp images that will play nicely for streaming and the thin bezel renders the machine compact enough to carry around all day long.</p>



<p>Internally, the Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core processor strikes a balance between energy efficiency and power. It’s not meant for heavy users doing intensive tasks like video editing or all-day gaming sessions but it’s good enough for everyday use and does it while monitoring battery life to take you through the day. Intel UHD Graphics 600 offers streaming capabilities for 4K media and light games, so it satisfies light media needs with ease. The laptop’s 4GB of RAM enhances multitasking abilities and speeds up app switching, making it less frustrating during those hectic moments.</p>
<p>Storage is acceptable considering the price with a 64GB embedded multimedia flash card providing quick access to your files and software, though you might want additional external or cloud storage if you’re creating high-definition video or large sets of photography. Windows 11 Home edition comes pre-installed, which gives you the updated features and interface improvements, which make the device run quicker and easier to navigate than older releases of Windows or limited systems like Chromebooks.</p>
<p>If your laptop needs aren’t fancy but you want something that runs Windows just fine, this one’s worth a look.</p>
