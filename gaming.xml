            <p>
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the Airship library, Innersloth and Schell Games have announced a 3D version of popular social stealth sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. Or at least, they have taken the existing VR version and made it non-VR. It's a stab in the back for the Meta Questers, perhaps, but it's great news for me, a person who has only ever owned the launch model of the PS4's VR headset, and is currently using its box as a draft excluder.

<p>
Among Us 3D will get a demo in Steam Next Fest next week. Here's a teaser trailer full of jaunty music.

"Experience the core Among Us gameplay you know and love -- tasks, sabotages, Emergency Meetings, and venting -- now in an extremely immersive, 3D environment where everything (yup, everything!) is close up and personal," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">the Steam page</a>. It'll support native proximity voice chat and crossplay functionality with VR users (but not the original Among Us game, unfortunately). You can expect "new and returning minigames" with first-person controls, and cosmetic customisation that makes use of a new Stardust currency. The Steam demo doesn't include all the core features - there's no crossplay with VR. 
</p>
<p>
After launch, they'll  be adding more modes, tasks, collaborations, hats and limited time events. So when is the full game launching? That's for Innersloth to know and you to wonder about until they spring up behind you and shove a release date through your guts.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbro%E2%80%99s-tentpole-franchises.1115229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive is officially making a new game based on one of Hasbro's big franchises. The news comes directly from Chris Cocks, formerly president of Wizards of the Coast and now CEO of parent company Hasbro (quote <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/20/hasbro-has-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Motley Fool</a>):</p>
<p><em>We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant about what it could be. Hasbro has several big franchises that could be adapted into a videogame: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, to name the most important ones. However, Transformers seems to be the most fitting for the developer behind the highly successful Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. There's already a G.I. Joe game starring Snake Eyes in development at Wizards of the Coast-owned developer Atomic Arcade, after all, and Dungeons and Dragons already has its own lineup: a co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Starbreeze</a> targeting a 2026 launch; a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Invoke</a>, formerly Tuque, developer of Dark Alliance; another game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Demeo developer Resolution Games</a>, now announced as <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/battlemarked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dungeons: Battlemarked</a>; and another game that Chris Cocks had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>Transformers fans, on the other hand, had to deal with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate at Splash Damage</a>. Plus, there's the fact that the studio's expertise seems much more suited to a shooter game rather than, say, a Magic: The Gathering game. Still, we'll have to wait and see. It might be a while before we learn more about this project.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Saber is also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok: Origins</a>, a triple-A RPG based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Jurassic Park Survival, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a> that was once in the hands of Aspyr. If that sounds like too much work, it's worth reminding that Saber is a massive company with many offices across the globe and nearly 2,700 employees.</p>

            <p>Supergiant Games has confirmed it hasn't recast any actors for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, following accusations from the voice actor of Athena the studio is unwilling to utilise the SAG-AFTRA interim agreement.</p>
<p>The US actors' union is currently on strike due to concerns over the use of AI in the games industry, but an interim agreement is in place to ensure acting work can still continue until a full agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Marin Miller, the voice behind Athena in both Hades and Hades 2, has accused Supergiant of recasting the character because the studio "refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>"It's possible you may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular," they wrote on social media. "If I am, it was not because I stepped away from the character willingly. It's because the employer refused to flip to an interim."</p>
<p>And while they didn't explicitly mention Supergiant, their follow up post wasn't subtle: "It would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors."</p>

</span></p><p>Supergiant has responded with a lengthy statement, confirming it has not re-cast any characters, but noted its games have not been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons".</p>
<p>"Voice talent has been integral to each of our games," the statement begins. "Recently, questions arose here about how we work with our voice talent, which we want to address."</p>
<p>Supergiant boasts it offers "the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable".</p>
<p>It continues: "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them.</p>
<p>"We have not re-cast any of our characters in Hades 2, and wish to keep working with each and every member of our wonderful cast.</p>
<p>"We have respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike. While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve."</p>
<p>It's unclear what the reasons are for not using SAG-AFTRA contracts, though many of the voice actors from Hades 2 are either in-house staff or British (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s Ben Starr, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s Colin Ryan, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler) and therefore not part of the US union. Or perhaps the studio believes its own protections are enough.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Supergiant for more information.</p>

</span></p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likhkirnp22q">follow up thread</a>, Miller emphasised their reliance on SAG-AFTRA for protection, noting this is the seventh month of the strike. "SAG-AFTRA contracts are protected by their legal staff - I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they wrote.</p>
<p>"Clients keep asking me, 'If we include a no-AI rider, will you work non-union or on a 2020 agreement?' Will you be willing to cover the costs of my legal fees if you violate my agreement? Why are you refusing to sign a contract I can enforce?"</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July last year</a>, with AI usage the primary concern of the union.</p>
<p>"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers that have signed the existing Interactive Media Agreement, responded: "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with celebrated voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Bayonetta 3) about the strike and why it's taking so long to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she says. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-second-major-update-adds-god-of-war-but-still-no-full-release-date">second major update to Hades 2</a> revealed yesterday, as the game remains in early access, without a full release date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has announced Among Us 3D for PC, with a Steam Next Fest demo set to debut next week.
</p>
<p>
This 3D, first-person version of the game isn't brand new, however. Virtual reality headset fans will notice this is very much Among Us VR without the VR.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Among Us 3D features crossplay with Among Us VR (though not, unsurprisingly, with the original 2D game). Essentially, this new version of the VR version allows a much wider 'flatscreen' PC audience to join in.

</figure>
<p>
Otherwise, this is the Among Us you know and have probably played before, now with an additional dimension. The game caters for between four and 10 players, and of course lets you customise your bean with hats.
</p>
<p>A new Stardust currency will be introduced to let you acquire more cosmetic items for your bean. Post-launch, the game will add new modes, tasks, collaborations, and additional limited time events. As well as more hats.
</p>
<p>
There's no full release date for Among Us 3D yet, and no word of it appearing outside of PC at all. Still, if you're interested, and if you're a Steam user, you should probably keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Steam page</a> for when its demo arrives as part of Steam Next Fest in just a couple of days.

		<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> patch, with hotfix 1.1.2 targeting a clutch of crash bugs so the game won’t keel over when “looking at certain locked doors”, “interacting with a cart” or when “spamming keys on the EULA screen”.</p>
<p>I think spamming keys at the EULA is pretty much universal gamer behaviour, because who’s got time in their finite lives to actually read that legalese gibberish? But once you actually get into the game, looking at doors of all kinds and interacting with carts are both pretty integral to the immersive medieval experience that KCD2 provides.</p>


<p>I’m poking a little bit of fun, of course, and it’s always good to see developers stamping out the odd little bugs and crashes that inevitably remain in games after release. Warhorse has plenty plans for more support with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions/">three major questline expansions coming through the rest of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched at the start of February to plenty of praise from critics – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our KCD2 review here</a> – and players alike, continuing down the immersive RPG style of the original. The game has already turned a profit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/542223437984170029">on its way to 2 million sales</a>, and the positive word of mouth could see that number keep on climbing, even in an absolutely stacked start to the year with big game releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the KCD2 Hotfix 1.1.2 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>Fortuna&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bozhena and Pavlena will no longer report the player for crimes during the quest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The King’s Gambit&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quest interactor for wine will no longer disappear, allowing players to continue pouring wine for the guests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the crossbow aiming zoom on ultrawide resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform-specific fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Epic Games Store: Fixed the issue with achievements not being completed after longer than one hour of play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the issue with rewards sometimes requiring game restart to be awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when looking at certain locked doors and chests.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash sometimes occurring loading the game after finishing the dice mini-game.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to opening the horse inventory.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to interacting with a cart.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when spamming keys on the EULA screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when having conflicting versions of the Bink library.</li>
<li>A few dozen additional stability fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-better-path-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> Update 3 has been released, and while there’s a huge swathe of bug fixes made throughout the game, the new features are all focussed on PC hardware support, improved path tracing, and broader availability of path tracing in the game.</p>
<p>With the recent releases of Nvidia’s GeForce 50 series cards and DLSS 4, this has now been integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, introducing the new transformer-based model for upscaling and ray-reconstruction, and up to 4x multi-frame generation. For AMD and Intel, AMD FSR 3.1 (with frame gen) is now integrated, and so is Intel XESS 1.4.</p>


<p>The game relies on certain ray-tracing effects for lighting and ambient occlusion across the board, but up until now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">the path tracing option</a> (described as ‘Full Ray Tracing’) has been limited to Nvidia GPUs that are more capable of getting playable performance out of it. MachineGames has now loosened the reigns on this, so AMD and Intel GPU owners can enable path tracing and enjoy what some might call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/09/assassins-creed-unity-devs-say-30fps-is-more-cinematic-and-feels-better/">more cinematic performance</a>…</p>
<p>Could this hint at a path tracing mode for the PS5 release of the game that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">expected this spring</a>, taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>? Probably not, but if it happens, I’m going to say “I told you so!”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (beware of spoilers through the bug fixes, though).</p>

<h2>NEW FEATURES</h2>
<h3>NVIDIA DLSS 4</h3>
<p>Update 3 brings support for NVIDIA DLSS 4: a suite of rendering technologies that boosts framerates, increases performance, and improves image quality! – Players using supported NVIDIA hardware can enable Multi Frame Generation (3x, 4x) using the new transformer-based model – Ray Reconstruction increases the clarity and stability of ray-traced images – DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution have also been updated to the transformer-based model. These options when enabled enhance native and upscaled image quality, respectively</p>
<h3>Ray-Traced Local Lights</h3>
<p>For players who have Path Tracing enabled, this update includes a new option for ray-traced shadows to include all light sources, which significantly increases the quality of shadows in interior locations. (Players can also choose to keep the previous setting, which provides ray-traced shadows from the sun only.)</p>
<h3>Path Tracing (Full Ray Tracing) Support for AMD and Intel Graphics Cards</h3>
<p>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer! Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</p>
<h3>FSR 3.1, including Frame Generation</h3>
<p>Update 3 adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology.</p>
<h3>Intel XESS 1.4</h3>
<p>Update 3 also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<h3>Quality of Life Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repair kits can now also be used by selecting them directly from the inventory (Rather than only by selecting your broken weapon or tool!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>BUG FIXES — MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!</h2>

<li>Fixed an issue where collecting the last ancient relic for “Riddles of the Ancients” did not update the counter in the UI, giving the impression there was still another to collect.

<li>Fixed an issue where the cogwheel markers might not appear if players purchased the map information pamphlet after a certain point in Sukhothai</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the main Sukhothai main map could be lost if you put it down after inspecting it (instead of collecting it)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would not leave Wat Si Sawai if you left the temple while she was talking with Aran</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent the desk drawer being opened in the poker tent in Gizeh</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would repeat her lines from the ambush (“That was too close”) while you are in the boat. Please note this will, unfortunately, not correct the issue for players who are currently experiencing the bug, but it will prevent it from happening again</li>
<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>

In addition to all of the robbery, there are also a handful of new locations, including an urban locale simply called Crime City.

<p>Details about Cliffhanger’s upcoming Black Panther game have surfaced online thanks to a popular leaker, and it seems players will be able to try out characters like T’Challa, Killmonger, Shuri and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new information about Cliffhanger’s Black Panther game comes from the popular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1892746064505246088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) provides players with exclusive details on the upcoming game, such as character choice, combat details, POV, exploration, narrative aspects, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details reveal that the upcoming Black Panther game will allow players to choose their protagonist, which varies from T’Challa to M’Baku, Azari, Shuri, Killmonger, and more. Each Black Panther will have unique weapons, armour, and gadgets. Regarding combat, players can expect “authentic African Martial Arts mixed with Superhuman strength/agility” along with tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding exploration, the upcoming Black Panther game will feature cities, savannahs, and other locations where players will experience different cultures and interact with new characters. The game will feature an over-the-shoulder POV. Lastly, Black Panther’s story will react to your choices and actions, providing players with “unique stories, missions &amp; dynamics” in return.</p>



<p>The Black Panther game was announced by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA in 2023</a>, with Cliffhanger Games developing the AAA title. Monolith’s Kevin Stephens is leading the project, and the team includes veterans from top franchises like Halo Infinite, God of War, Call of Duty, and others.&nbsp;A job listing from last year confirmed an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-panther-game-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a> for the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has crossed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million players</a> in three months. Also, NetEase has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> on the recent layoffs.

		<p>Innersloth and Schell Games have revealed an un-VR-ified version of Among Us VR. Among Us 3D is coming to PC via Steam with a Steam Next Fest demo coming next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Us 3D ???? Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the fullness of time, Among Us 3D will be a flatscreen counterpart to Among Us VR, coming with cross-play between the two 3D adaptations of the hit social deduction game. In turn, it is very much like the original 2D Among Us… but in three dimensions. The game can be played with 4-10 players, all running around completing tasks on the map until a murdered body is discovered, calling an Emergency Meeting to try and determine who the imposter is, and eject the into space. Of course, playing either in VR or 3D makes this all much closer and more personal…</p>
<p>The Steam Next Fest demo is more limited than the full Among Us 3D release will be, and will not support all features or game modes. So there’s no crossplay or additional cosmetics, until the full release comes down the pipe.</p>
<p>Here’s the feature breakdown from the Steam listing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Native Proximity Voice Chat</strong> — Yap with your friends directly in-game. No need for additional third-party platforms!</li>
<li><strong>New and Returning Minigames</strong> —&nbsp; Experience the tasks you know and love, along with some new ones. Now, with first-person controls.</li>
<li><strong>Crossplay Functionality —</strong> Join lobbies with other VR<i> </i>players! (<i>Note: <strong>The game is NOT compatible with the original </strong></i><strong>Among Us <i>game</i></strong><i>. Sorry, beans.</i>)</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Beansona </strong>— Expand your wardrobe of hats, gloves, and skins with an endless number of cosmetic customization combinations!</li>
</ul>
<p>After Among Us became one of the breakout hits of 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/among-us-is-getting-vr/">Innersloth partnered with Schell Games to produce Among Us VR</a>, launching in 2022. It’s a great fit conceptually for VR, adding more tactile minigames, the isolation of running around doing tasks, while trying to be aware of your surroundings and spot suspicious behaviour. But VR games have often been adapted back to flatscreen, and now it’s Among Us’ turn to make that return trip. The 2D original game will surely remain the most popular version of Among Us, but a 3D counterpart is sure to pick up an audience of its own, especially with VR cross-play.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings">A Lord of the Rings</a> game has been delayed again, being pushed back from March to a new 29th July 2025 release date. The cosy Hobbit life sim is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Netflix gaming.</p>
<p>Weta Workshop announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-of-the-shire">Tales of the Shire</a> delay on a place we ain’t linking to these days:</p>


<p>Dear Fellow Hobbits,</p>
<p>A good Hobbit feast takes time, and so does <a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> the Shire! We’re taking a little longer to ensure that every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cozy experience. The game will now launch on July 29, 2025.</p>
<p>We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth, and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you’ll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right.</p>

<p>We appreciate your patience and cannot wait for you to experience life in The Shire this summer. In the meantime, arrange the table, polish your silver and get ready for a feast fit for a Hobbit!</p>
<p>Looking forward to welcoming you to Bywater.</p>
<p>—From the folks at Weta Workshop Game Studio</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/tales-of-the-shire-is-a-cosy-life-sim-set-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-universe/">announced</a> and expected to launch in 2024, Tales of the Shire has now had multiple delays. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">A rough 2025 window</a> was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">narrowed to March 2025</a>, but clearly Weta need more time to realise this cosy take on fantasy world.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more.1115199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-new-rumor-set-in-hammerfell-and-high-rock-featuring-naval-combat-ship-building-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The second The Elder Scrolls VI news item of the week is a rarity, to be sure. After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-can-get-you-into-the-game-as-an-npc-for-a-meager-10-5k-and-upward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> of Bethesda's silent auction to work with the highest bidder on adding a non-player character (NPC) to the game, though, we have a much juicier rumor from extas1s on the game itself.</p>
<p>The leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY3Udvjn1Eo&amp;pp=ygUHZXh0YXMxcw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> info from a colleague who heard that major technical improvements will be made to the Creation Engine 2 seen in Starfield. These improvements could possibly reduce or eliminate load times between zones in an attempt to make the game feel more immersive. Needless to say, this would be a major boon to Bethesda's games, which have always had to deal with this shortcoming.</p>
<p>In terms of setting, the rumor confirms previous speculations that the game will take place in both Hammerfell and High Rock, the homes of the Redguards and Bretons, respectively. Interestingly, according to the source, The Elder Scrolls VI could feature between twelve and thirteen major cities, which would be a major step up from Skyrim, where there are only four or five that could really be considered that way.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing details reported is that the game will feature naval exploration, combat, and shipbuilding. This would be a transformed version of what we saw in Starfield, although of course, naval exploration and combat in the actual sea instead of space would be very different. Likewise, we might see the return of another feature seen in Starfield but originally introduced with Fallout 4: Settlements. Again, this would be expanded to allow players to build and customize villages and fortresses.</p>
<p>The character progression is said to be completely freeform, with improvements to the magic and melee combat systems. Lastly, dragons would be featured prominently, not only through boss encounters but also in the story.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unlikely part of the rumor is that we could see a teaser for The Elder Scrolls VI as early as this June, presumably at the Xbox Game Showcase, alongside the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored Oblivion remaster/remake</a>. This seems really farfetched, to be honest. Bethesda is known for only showing their games relatively close to release, and it's nowhere near time for that. Starfield only <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in September 2023, so realistically, The Elder Scrolls VI won't be released before 2027.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do you think of these details? Would you be happy if they were confirmed? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Boss Fight, Ranked]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-boss-fight-ranked.1115190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, without any doubt, one of the best games in the entire series. It debuted on PlayStation 2 way back in 2004, and since then, it has remained a cult classic title, the subject of many memes, and the target of re-releases and remasters. It features a collection of boss fights, each one as memorable as the other, and all of them unique in their way. </p>



<p>In this list, I’m breaking down all the Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, ranking them in order of how awesome they are to behold.</p>



<hr>







<p>It’s mostly subjective, right? For one man’s trash, there’s another man’s treasure – and that’s the same thing with these boss fights. They’re all special in their way, but some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 boss fights are so iconic that they’ll stick in our minds forever.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-the-pain">9. The Pain</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pain is the first member of ‘Cobra’ that we get to fight in MGS3: Snake Eater. As such, his fight is relatively plain and easy to overcome, and his abilities are rather weak and not all that impressive. He can control bees – that’s about it. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-the-shagohod">8. The Shagohod</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You wouldn’t think that going up against an enormous, nuclear-capable tank would be a boring boss fight, but that’s just what it is. It’s memorable because you’re fighting something so massive, but it’s an on-rails scene followed by a repetitive mechanism that sees you bring the behemoth to its knees relatively quickly.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-the-sorrow">7. The Sorrow</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Sorrow’s battle is one of the cleverest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, as it’s built around how you’ve played the game up until that point. If you’ve killed lots of enemies, your battle here will be ‘longed out’, but if you’re on a no-kill run, it’ll be over quickly. It rewards users with a nice camo suit, but ultimately, this fight is a walking simulator – but a smart one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-ocelot">6. Ocelot</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ocelot is cool – he’s one of the best Metal Gear Solid characters of all time and a memorable one at that. He and Naked Snake clash three times in Snake Eater, but the most exciting fight with him is his first one, when he is using his dual revolvers across a crevice – it’s the scene from which a few memes surfaced over the years. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-the-end">5. The End</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting The End can either be an intense slog riddled with jumpscares or it can be the easiest battle in the world. Originally, users could trick the game, setting the time/date on their PlayStation 2 forward by a week once they’ve met The End, and he’d die in-game of old age… Clever, right? Otherwise, players could take part in a thrilling cat-and-mouse sniper battle across several regions of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-fear">4. The Fear</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fear lives up to his name by basically offering up the creepiest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight in the game. He’s a strange, fork-tongued man who can dislocate his limbs at will, scramble up trees like a spider, and strike at Naked Snake with a crossbow in relative silence. With his remarkable camouflage, players are left to rely on sounds to track him, and he leaves traps everywhere to trip Snake up.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-the-fury">3. The Fury</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fury is a phenomenal boss that fights the player in a suffocating battle backed up by an overwhelming flamethrower and a whole lot of anger. He’s not insanely difficult to kill, but he can devastate the player very quickly in the close-knit, phobia-inducing environment in which the fight takes place. At the end of the fight, he supernovates and explodes in a brutal, cataclysmic eruption.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-colonel-volgin">2. Colonel Volgin</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As the big baddy in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Colonel Volgin makes for a fantastic opponent. There are plenty of secret tricks the player can use to turn the tide of battle, but his abilities alone make his face-off one of the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights in the game. He’s a powerful fighter with electromagnetic and lightning powers, and visually, he’s one of the most impressive bosses in Metal Gear history.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-the-boss">1. The Boss</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If there’s a more emotional boss battle in gaming, I don’t know what it is. At the very end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake must fight his mentor – The Boss. She means a huge amount to Snake, but still, he must do away with her, and that means an intense battle between the master and the apprentice must take place. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack to this fight is incredible and the setting is nothing short of beautiful. It’s such a dramatic battle, it’s the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight on record.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Being Sued For ‘Artificially High Prices’ on PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-being-sued-for-%E2%80%98artificially-high-prices%E2%80%99-on-playstation-store.1115181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that a Dutch consumer group has filed a class action lawsuit against Sony. The organisation – Massaschade &amp; Consument – alleges that Sony is keeping prices on the PlayStation Store ‘artificially high’ and is abusing a position of power by preventing players from buying digital versions of PS4 and PS5 games elsewhere.</p>



<p>The class action lawsuit joins others that have surfaced recently in Portugal and the United Kingdom, and this particular suit is exclusively reserved for residents of the Netherlands.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-re-paying-too-much-for-playstation-games">‘You’re Paying Too Much for PlayStation Games’</h2>



<p>The class action lawsuit, which was discovered first by ‘<a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/231990/nederlandse-stichting-start-massaclaim-tegen-sony-om-prijzen-playstation-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tweakers</a>‘, states clearly in the headline that ‘you’re paying too much for PlayStation games’. The suit has dubbed the alleged overpayments ‘Sony Tax’, and it stresses that all PlayStation gamers in the Netherlands have a right to compensation.</p>



<p>On February 17, the legal body wrote to Sony to ‘hold it liable to the abuse of its dominant position and its further unlawful conduct in relation to the PlayStation 4 and 5.’</p>



<p>Netherlands residents <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can register</a> as part of the class action lawsuit for free by completing a simple form. The only requirement is that you’ve made a digital purchase via the PlayStation Store at some point since November 29, 2013. You must also be at least eight years old.</p>



<p>In a statement on the site promoting the class action lawsuit, it was explained what Sony is doing wrong:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The gaming industry is now bigger than the film, TV and music industries combined. Sony, as the manufacturer of the world’s best-selling console, is one of the most powerful – if not the most powerful – players in this market. And with such power comes responsibility. In the EU, it is illegal for large companies to abuse their position to make more profit at the expense of consumers. Yet Sony does not fully comply with these rules.</p>



<p>When you buy a digital game or in-game content, Sony ensures that this can only be done via its own PlayStation Store. Sony keeps the market for itself in this way and can keep the prices artificially high. As a result, you pay more, without getting anything extra in return. This is also called the <strong>‘Sony Tax’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In November 2023, Sony faced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-being-sued-5-billion-class-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whopping £5 billion class action lawsuit</a> in the United Kingdom for this very same reason. That case was kicked off in 2022, but the most recent documentation about the lawsuit was published midway through 2024, and the results of the proceedings are unclear.</p>



<p>Do you think Sony has an issue with PlayStation Store prices? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline right now, but fortunately it's not because anything is wrong. Quite the opposite, in fact--Fortnite is down because of routine scheduled maintenance that Epic does with every update. In this case, the update is a big one: the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite battle royale Chapter 6 Season 2</a>, featuring major changes to the island, piles of new weapons and gadgets, and the arrival of Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Chapter 6 got off to quite a bang during Season 1, as Fortnite introduced the permanent OG mode with its own separate battle pass, and also the Counter-Strike-esque Ballistic mode. In January, the season ramped up once more with the addition of the player-controlled Godzilla boss and the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Festival. But all things must come to an end--we had our fun with the ridiculous Typhoon Blade, but now it's time to move on to less civilized weapons, like the big drill weapon we saw in the trailer.</p><h2><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 start time</strong></h2><p>When the servers come back up, it'll be Lawless season, which is all about committing armed robbery. That's right, it's Fortnite's fourth heist-themed season. But where the past seasons like this had more of a classy bent, Lawless season is going to be more in the vein of Grand Theft Auto--mayhem is the name of the game here.</p><p>Since we're already in downtime, the wait shouldn't be too long. Fortnite went offline at 2 AM ET/11 PM PT, and season updates typically take somewhere in the ballpark of 4-7 hours. If all goes well, you could be fragging away in Crime City by 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. But don't take that as a given--when Chapter 5 Season 2 launched a year ago, something went wrong, and Fortnite stayed offline until the evening. But that was a very unusual case. Most seasons launch between 4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET.</p><p>Every new battle royale season dramatically changes the gameplay meta, and Season 2 will not be an exception. This crime-fueled season will add a new urban location, Crime City, as well as a bundle of new tools, like timed explosives, sticky grenades, and a rocket drill, that will help you steal gold and whatever else you can find. For more on what you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">check out our rundown here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/metal-bringer-launches-march-12<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Genres > Roguelite [219 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">Roguelite</a> <a title="Genres > Action [2,504 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em><a title="Games > Metal Bringer [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/metal-bringer">Metal Bringer</a></em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,898 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,412 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334170/Metal_Bringer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on March 12 for $19.99, publisher <a title="Companies > PLAYISM [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/playism">PLAYISM</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Alphawing [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/alphawing">Alphawing</a> announced. It will support English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese language support. An updated version of the PC demo is also available. <span id="more-945607"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via PLAYISM:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ About the Game</strong></p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Metal Bringer is the second game in the Bringer series, and this time, the setting is completely different—in this game, you fight in a sci-fi world with androids and giant robots in horde-based combat that’s even more satisfying than the last game all while enjoying an in-depth character customization system.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Highly Customizable Player Characters and Arms</strong> – Build and control android soldiers called “Labor,” or have them pilot giant machines called “Arms.” Each and every Labor and Arms you build is highly customizable. You can change the color and appearance of their features, or swap out parts to change their fighting styles.</li><li><strong>Effortlessly Wipe Out Hordes of Enemies</strong> – Labor can be strengthened by installing different types of apps. App disks can be obtained by defeating enemies, but you lose all installed apps when you fall in battle. However, by analyzing an app’s data at a shop, you can use it when you customize your next Labor, allowing you to perform better each run until you can freely trample all over your opponents with ease.</li><li><strong>Obtain Enemy Arms Parts on the Go</strong> – Even the most powerful Arms will eventually wear down, but when that happens, you can use Arms parts left behind by the enemy. What’s more, you can analyze the blueprints of powerful Arms parts over the course of the game, which unlocks various customization options. Find out what kind of gear suits you best to build the ideal mech.</li><li><strong>Ray Tracing and Ever-Changing Music</strong> – This game uses the same retro art style as <a title="Games > Samurai Bringer [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/samurai-bringer">Samurai Bringer</a>, and just like Samurai Bringer, it also implements a real time pixel art generating system, and will also feature the newest raytracing technology for beautifully lit environments. The music too is made with the newest technology, as it is played in real time and changes according to how your fights are playing out.</li><li><strong>All-Star Art Team</strong> – The protagonist Suria and the keyart were designed by Suzuhito Yasuda, and on the writing team, we have Sami Shinosaki on board! The pixel art portraits for Suria are drawn by illustrator kutsuwa.<ul><li><strong>Suzuhito Yasuda</strong> – Illustrator, manga artist, and character designer for multiple popular games and media, such as <em>Durarara!!</em> and the <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a>: Devil Survivor</em> series. Creator of the ongoing manga series <em>Bootsleg</em> and <em>Yozakura <a title="Games > Quartet" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/quartet">Quartet</a></em> (serialized in Monthly Shonen Sirius).</li><li><strong>Sami Shinosaki</strong> – Novelist. Known for the novelizations of the <em>Armored Core</em> and <em>Fire Emblem</em> series.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>■ About the New Demo</strong></p><p>When we released the first Metal Bringer demo back in October 2024 for the Steam Next Fest, it received a “Mostly Positive” rating on Steam. Ever since, we’ve improved and polished the demo based on user feedback, and this new demo has been overhauled to provide an even better experience.</p><p>Whether you’ve already played the old demo, or if this is your first time hearing of it, please give the new demo a try, and we hope you’ll enjoy it!</p><p>Note: As we will continue to improve the full game based on feedback received from the demo, demo progress will not be saved. Demo save data will not carry over to the full game.</p><ul><li><strong>Improved Tutorial</strong> – The tutorials have been expanded, and we’ve adjusted the timing of when tutorials are displayed relative to player progression, making it easier to understand the game’s system as you play. Gameplay tutorials can also be accessed at any time by opening the Control Guide from the pause menu.</li><li><strong>Balancing Changes</strong> – We’ve adjusted various aspects of the gameplay such as the difficulty curve and the player character’s initial parameters, as well as optimized the lock-on systems and default input config. This should make the game easier to play from the get-go even with your character’s initially weak abilities.</li><li><strong>User Interface Changes</strong> – We’ve changed the user interface of the Labor and Arms assembly menu, making it possible for players to compare the specs of weapons and Arms Gear while assembling a new unit. We have also changed the on-screen map and indicators for easier viewing.</li><li><strong>New Story Elements</strong> – The demo only contains a small part of the story, but we have added a large number of story elements to the demo, including conversations with enemy Labor and events that reveal more about the game’s world. We hope this will allow players to learn more about the world of Metal Bringer and have a more immersive experience.</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous Changes</strong> – We’ve also made other small improvements to many aspects of the game, such as improving the shop system, adding the ability to withdraw D-Chips in the field, improving the map functionality, and adding new apps and OS tuning options. Please try out the demo to see what it has to offer!</li></ul><p><strong>Demo-Exclusive Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Newbie</strong> – Power up and customize your Labor with apps as you learn the basic game mechanics and play through the beginning of the story. Your Labor will start out weak, but keep growing stronger to defeat a boss within the time limit!</li><li><strong>Extreme</strong> – Use Labor and Arms that have already been strengthened to a certain extent to take on mid-game battles. Choose whatever kind of Labor, weapon, and Arms you like to overpower the boss!</li></ul><p>Extreme Mode is unlocked from the title screen after you watch the opening scene and roll out on an investigation for the first time in Newbie Mode.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Metal Bringer - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx_i5VMEF3I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『メタルブリンガー』発売日発表トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mX5zaxf2KU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They represent s​even identity groups​: Asian, Black, 2SLGBTQIA+, Latinx/Hispanic, family of all kinds, women and gender minorities​, and interfaith.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Now, in February, that text has been removed, and replaced with:</p><blockquote><p>All employees are welcome to create or join Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are voluntary employee-led groups mentored by executive sponsors.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Other sections, like employee training pages mentioning "Diversity and Inclusion”, have also been edited to delete certain wording, while whole pages, like those discussing executive salary bonuses tied to diversity accomplishments, "have been removed from the website entirely", according to <em>404</em>.</p><p>While these appear to have had little effect on the company's internal operations--staff speaking to <em>404 </em>say nothing has changed in terms of the ERGs or internal messaging about diversity--it's still a chilling sight to see a media company, one that employs an international workforce of diverse people, making such a clearly submissive gesture to an increasingly authoritarian government that, with a hatred of the media as one of its core tenets, will not give half a shit about gestures.</p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/ziff-davis-dei-commitment-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see detailed examples of the changes at <em>404</em></a>, where you should also subscribe so you can read more of their <em>excellent </em>work.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-might-be-the-series-coziest-jrpg-yet-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After over two dozen mainline games, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to innovate and stay relevant in an era where a great game is coming out every few weeks, but that’s exactly what KOEI TECMO aims to do with the next entry in its long-running Atelier JRPG series, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land. After spending over six hours gathering resources, doing Sailor Moon-esque magical dancing rituals, and riding around on a motorbike, I’m inclined to believe they’ll pull off just that, yet again. With more engaging combat, improved visuals, more convenient crafting, and an entirely new building system that lets you put your own personal touch on the world, there’s quite a bit to be optimistic about, even if what I saw of the story and characters was, at least so far in the opening hours, pretty boilerplate stuff for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played any of the recent Atelier games, then you probably won’t be shocked by Atelier Yumia at first glance. All three of the pillars that have been around since its conception are still alive and well: exploration, where you run around collecting resources and solving puzzles; combat, where you fight baddens with a party chock-full of pretty anime friends, and synthesis, where you combine your hard-won resources into alchemical creations that make you stronger. But each has been given a substantial overhaul (not to mention a serious facelift) that breathes new life into a familiar formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework, with action-based systems that let you perfect parry, dodge out of the way, and switch to different range bands depending on whether you’d like to thwack enemies in melee or take them down from a distance. At lower levels, combat seemed fairly undemanding, as I was able to just unload every ability I had, swap to other characters to do the same, then repeat it all again, ending most encounters in a matter of seconds, but later on (and especially when I wasn’t properly leveled) I seriously got rinsed if I wasn’t paying attention to enemy attack patterns and working on my timing. It never got especially challenging so long as I was properly leveled, but it was nice to see a less passive combat system that I couldn’t just steamroll through while on autopilot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration also had some improvements, like having a gun to stun enemies and collect resources at a distance, ziplines that help you navigate the map more easily once you find and activate both sides of the line, and, crucially, a badass motorcycle for you to speed around on that makes getting around much easier. Finally, there’s Synthesis, which in typically Atelier fashion is so dang complicated, you could spend quite a bit of time customizing and min-maxing every aspect of your gear and crafting new items and attacks to use in battle. Or, if you don’t have the patience like me, you can just hit “auto mode” and it’ll automatically optimize all of it for you. Not that I don’t enjoy this aspect of the series, but it’s certainly nice to have the option of leaping back into the action quickly for times where I wasn’t in the mood to tinker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atelier Yumia also shakes things up by adding a fourth fairly significant activity to the list of things to do as you explore and level up: the ability to build and customize settlements throughout the world map. That’s right – Atelier Yumia seems to be leaning into the cozy craze, so now you can have a little bit of Animal Crossing or Sims with your JRPG by constructing your fantasy cottage on a patch of land and spending some quality downtime with your party members. I was only able to dabble in this a bit, given the constraint of the resources available to me in the early part of the story, but I could definitely see myself sinking quite a bit of time into taming the wilds with an elaborately decorated home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all Atelier has going for it, I will say that it did very little to make itself stand out in terms of story. The characters and foreshadowing of the undoubtedly epic and convoluted story that starts to develop in the opening hours aren’t bad by any means, but at least so far everything has been quite predictable and retreads a lot of ground we’ve seen from JRPGs of the past. This is especially true of the characters I met during my explorations, like the ditzy by wholesome Isla and the stoic and no-nonsense Viktor, both of whom I feel like I’ve seen half a hundred times already. But this is the beginning of a JRPG, so in all likelihood it’s just going to take a while for the story to start rolling or for characters to show their true colors to any level of satisfaction, leaving plenty of opportunity for my concerns to disappear given more time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Atelier Yumia marks the first time the series will appear on the Xbox platform, and as a Westerner who would quite like more JRPGs to be readily available, that’s pretty awesome to see. Achievement unlocked!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from.

            <p>
There've been strong hints a new Tony Hawk project is in the works for some time now, but it looks like an official announcement could finally be looming - based on a sneaky tease that's appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s latest map.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Activision might be looking to revive its dormant skating franchise first emerged last September, when Tony Hawk <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">revealed he'd "been talking to [the publisher] again"</a>. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones' claims earlier this month</a> that he was "in a Tony Hawk coming out... a new one they're remastering".
</p>
<p>
And it now looks like Activision may finally be readying to make things official. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update went live earlier today, introducing a remastered version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a>'s skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind.
</p>

<figcaption>And there's a Black Ops 6's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeOzkKmOtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Although the skatepark serves as Grind's focal point, the map also hosts several other notable areas - including a skate-themed store that appears to be teasing some big things. To the rear of the unit hangs a large TV screen showing the date 03.04.25, alongside the unmistakable branding Activision used for 2020's well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1+2 remake.
</p>
<p>
The obvious inference is that Activision will be announcing its new Tony Hawk project on 4th March this year (or possibly 3rd April, if it's suddenly come over all European). And as to what it'll be revealing, it's hard not to suspect - given the branding and Tyshawn Jones' previous talk of "remastering" - we could be looking at an announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4.
</p>

Tony Hawk himself previously revealed a Pro Skater 3+4 remake had been in the works at one point following the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. However, plans were reportedly scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard, turning it into support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard games.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Activision is teasing, it doesn't look like we'll have too long to wait before everything is revealed. And in the meantime, there's always Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update, which - alongside its new Grind map - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-calling-on-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">playing host to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

			<p>As the dawn of a new Atelier alchemist JRPG entry comes to pass, Koei Tecmo recently invited Wccftech and a few other journalists from RPG Site and IGN, among others, to go hands-on with the upcoming Atelier Yumia. Bearing a moniker befitting a light novel series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-combat-and-synthesis-details-revealed-for-atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a> marks a new series under the long-running franchise banner, picking up where the Atelier Ryza trilogy left off. In this preview session, we were permitted full access to the first few hours of the latest build on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia opens in media res during an exploration of ancient ruins accompanied by party members who only make a brief appearance as footnotes to this introductory sequence before flashing back to an earlier time when Yumia herself is only just starting out to dabble in the forbidden dark arts of alchemy. It’s here that Yumia is part of an established survey corps sent out to delve into the secrets of the fall of the Aladissian Empire, where this 26th entry in the long-running Atelier series takes place.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-event1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite a new subseries filled with brand-new mechanics, both in the fields of gathering and crafting as well as combat, Atelier Yumia kicks things off almost immediately with brief tutorials that lead up to Yumia soon taking over an abandoned building to call home as her first Atelier. It’s all in a day's work for the Survey Corps that Yumia and her fellow compatriots ascribe to serving and doing a little bit of everything from heavy lifting to monster culling and crafting. Even at the beginning of the adventure, Yumia Liessfeldt has already made a small name for herself, both as a friend to those in need with a small advance party and with a couple of other corps members who join her in combat while also being a bit of a black sheep for dabbling in the dark arts. For reasons unknown early on in the story, alchemy is seen as something not to be trusted and from an ancient civilization.</p>
<p>In order to truly engage in proper alchemy, Yumia first needs the right materials to do so. While past Atelier games would limit what players could harvest in their basket and bring back to the alchemy workshops, Yumia gives the players a nigh-endless backpack right from the start, more than capable of holding whatever ore and flowers the player can pick up along the way. Gone is the need for gathering tools, as Yumia and her gunstaff are more than equipped to help gather whatever is on hand. See some ore on a hillside that’s just out of reach? Shoot it down. For the first time in the series, Atelier Yumia gives players the option to take some of the crafting on the road and create field items, such as medicines and ammo, without needing to return to the main workshop.</p>
<p>These workshops themselves are initially little more than stripped bare buildings and structures. It’s up to Yumia and the player to rebuild these areas, first crafting up furniture like storage containers before placing them around freely within the confines of the buildable space. Some of the early ateliers appear to be somewhat limiting in how many props can be installed in each, but in a separate preview Gust showed us during our onboarding, there were the abilities to make the building layouts and designs far more intricate with exterior structures and fortifications. Gust wanted to hit on the sense of expression for players to build out these workshops in their own way, which all also double as fast travel points to get around the open world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-battle2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Each Atelier title takes its own spin on how items are actually crafted with alchemy form base materials and Atelier Yumia is no exception. At the heart of each alchemy recipe is the memory of the finished item, which is stored in Yumia’s Memory Vial. By recalling the overall concept of an item, she can then select an Alchemy Core to imbue. In our preview, Yumia only had access to a single alchemy core which could increase the air damage of the crafted tool. From here, players then need to select the key ingredients from the recipe and attach them to nodes within the alchemy core. This is where Yumia gets unusually complex, with mana essence floating about as ingredients are added to the core while extracting mana from these components. Each component added has its own resonance aura and gathers in free flowing mana within that range to boost the effectiveness of the final outcome.</p>
<p>As we only had one Alchemy Core at our disposal, our preview was limited in terms of options for truly being able to customize items. Continuously crafting the same recipe will slowly level it up to a maximum level of 10. Each subsequent level will increase the quality of the item or open up the inclusion of other Alchemy Cores. The same four-element system is at play here, but I couldn’t delve deeply enough to see how the strength of a given ingredient’s element plays into the finished outcome.</p>
<p>New to Atelier Yumia is the ability to craft on the go as well. While she doesn’t have the equipment to craft everything away from an atelier, she can at least craft some of the more useful consumables, such as bullets for her gunstaff. I’m amazed that it’s taken this long for such a simple feature to become an Atelier staple and incentivizes players to spend more time out in the open world and reaching deeper into exploration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-battle1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Atelier Yumia’s combat is such a strange beast that is a drastic change from earlier Atelier titles. If nothing else, they’ve taken some inspiration from other action RPGs like Tales. Players take control of Yumia or any of her other party members at a given time. The field of battle takes place at both close and long range with many cast members having different attacks based on range. Players can attack freely while also using abilities that run off cooldown timers. In the case of Yumia, she can create items like Flamia swords and other elemental items, while the head of Gust confirmed in our exclusive interview that they’re trying to move away from bombs being a core part of the alchemist’s toolbag. True to its action RPG roots, Yumia and cast can dodge and block incoming attacks with perfectly timed mitigations, rewarding the player with a damaging counterattack. All of these actions can culminate in a rather modestly named ultimate attack called a Friend Action once a specific battle gauge is filled completely.</p>
<p>In making the combat more free-flowing and the exploration al fresco, Gust has opened up the series to a wider generation, and that’s not including adding the Xbox platform to the mix for the first time. Series veterans may decry the loose nature and lack of a structured calendar that was the backbone of the Atelier series for oh so long, but it’s only the natural evolution of an alchemical nature.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land will launch on both PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam) globally on March 21st, 2025.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Koei Tecmo and Gust provided hotel and travel accomodations to Wccftech to attend their preview event.]</em></p>

                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games.

The post did not name Supergiant Games directly, but in a follow up post they wrote that it would be "SUPER helpful" if their followers wrote a "GIANT email" asking the studio to "flip" for their actors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now Supergiant Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o">has responded</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, saying it has not re-cast any characters in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that it hopes to keep working with its "wonderful cast."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This dispute </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike">echoes our December 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reporting on a similar conflict between </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Activision and the cast of the game's Zombies campaign. In both cases, it's been alleged that the studio declined to update their contracts with actors under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements">SAG-AFTRA interim agreement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and as a result the original actors are not reprising their roles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are key differences between the two casting disputes. Activision is a member of the interactive media bargaining group, a collection of studios that collective bargain with the union to cast SAG-AFTRA members in their games. In its statement, Supergiant Games says none of its games have been made under SAG-AFTRA contracts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision quietly recast Black Ops 6 Zombies actors during SAG-AFTRA strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Miller had been initially cast under a non-union contract and was requesting the studio re-up them under an interim SAG-AFTRA contract, that would be a different situation than the one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Ops 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> actors faced last year.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who protects voice actors from AI and contract violations?">Who protects voice actors from AI and contract violations?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In follow-up posts on Bluesky, Miller offered further insight on why they might turn down a contract from a non-union client even if that client offers robust protections against using their voice for generative AI. They explained that as a union member, they receive legal protection from SAG-AFTRA that can go after any company that decides to violate the terms of a contract. "I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they stated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Miller signed a non-union agreement with a studio that promised not to use their voice for generative AI, but the studio turned around and did so anyway, they would need to pay out of pocket for a lawyer to fight the case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be clear, Miller does not accuse Supergiant of attempting to use generative AI, and Supergiant vociferously shot down the idea that it would use AI technology. "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them," it wrote. "We offer the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now Miller and the company appear to be at a standstill. The actor stated that they will only work on projects signed to a SAG-AFTRA interim agreement, and Supergiant stated that it "[respects] and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve," it added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear at this time if any other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cast members have made similar requests of the company.

<p>Nvidia's RTX 50-series makes its first foray below the $1,000 mark starting this week, with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti—at least in theory.</p>
<p>The third-fastest card in the Blackwell GPU lineup, the 5070 Ti is still far from "reasonably priced" by historical standards (the 3070 Ti was $599 at launch). But it's also $50 cheaper and a fair bit faster than the outgoing 4070 Ti Super and the older 4070 Ti. These are steps in the right direction, if small ones.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about its performance shortly, but at a high level, the 5070 Ti's performance falls in the same general range as the 4080 Super and the original RTX 4080, a card <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/">that launched for $1,199</a> just over two years ago. And it's probably your floor for consistently playable native 4K gaming for those of you out there who don't want to rely on DLSS or 4K upscaling to hit that resolution (it's also probably all the GPU that most people will need for high-FPS 1440p, if that's more your speed).</p>
<p>But it's a card I'm ambivalent about! It's close to 90 percent as fast as a 5080 for 75 percent of the price, at least if you go by Nvidia's minimum list prices, which for the 5090 and 5080 have been mostly fictional so far. If you can find it at that price—and that's a big "if," since every $749 model is <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=5070+Ti&amp;Order=1">already out of stock across the board at Newegg</a>—and you're desperate to upgrade or are building a brand-new 4K gaming PC, you could do worse. But I wouldn't spend more than $749 on it, and it might be worth waiting to see what AMD's first 90-series Radeon cards look like in a couple weeks before you jump in.</p>

<p>Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version of the 5070 Ti, so this time around our review unit is <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rtx5070ti-16g/">an Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> provided by Asus and Nvidia. These third-party cards will deviate a little from the stock specs listed above, but factory overclocks tend to be inordinately mild, and done mostly so the GPU manufacturer can slap a big "overclocked" badge somewhere on the box. We tested this Asus card with its BIOS switch set to "performance" mode, which elevates the boost clock by an entire 30 MHz; you don't need to be a math whiz to guess that a 1.2 percent overclock is not going to change performance much.</p>
<p>Compared to the 4070 Ti Super, the 5070 Ti brings two things to the table: a roughly 6 percent increase in CUDA cores and a 33 percent increase in memory bandwidth, courtesy of the switch from GDDR6X to GDDR7. The original 4070 Ti had even fewer CUDA cores, but most importantly for its 4K performance included just 12GB of memory on a 192-bit bus.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is based on the same GB203 GPU silicon as the 5080 series, but with 1,792 CUDA cores disabled. But there are a lot of similarities between the two, including the 16GB bank of GDDR7 and the 256-bit memory bus. It looks nothing like the yawning gap between the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080, and the two cards' similar-ish specs meant they weren't too far away from each other in our testing. The 5070 Ti's 300 W power requirement is also a bit lower than the 5080's 360 W, but it's pretty close to the 4080 and 4080 Super's 320 W; in practice, the 5070 Ti draws about as much as the 4080 cards do under load.</p>

<p>As a Blackwell GPU, the 5070 Ti also supports Nvidia's most-hyped addition to the 50-series: support for DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation (MFG). We've already covered this in our 5090 and 5080 reviews, but the short version is that MFG works exactly like Frame Generation did in the 40-series, except that it can now insert up to three AI-generated frames in between natively rendered frames instead of just one.</p>
<p>Especially if you're already running at a reasonably high frame rate, this can make things look a lot smoother on a high-refresh-rate monitor without introducing distractingly excessive lag or weird rendering errors. The feature is mainly controversial because Nvidia is comparing 50-series performance numbers with DLSS MFG enabled to older 40-series cards without DLSS MFG to make the 50-series cards seem a whole lot faster than they actually are.</p>
<p>We'll publish some frame-generation numbers in our review, both using DLSS and (for AMD cards) FSR. But per usual, we'll continue to focus on natively rendered performance—more relevant for all the games out there that don't support frame generation or don't benefit much from it, and more relevant because your base performance dictates how good your generated frames will look and feel anyway.</p>
<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>We tested the 5070 Ti in the same updated testbed and with the same updated suite of games that we started using in our RTX 5090 review. The heart of the build is an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D, ensuring that our numbers are limited as little as possible by the CPU speed.</p>
<p>Per usual, we prioritize testing GPUs at resolutions that we think most people will use them for. For the 5070 Ti, that means both 4K and 1440p—this card is arguably still overkill for 1440p, but if you're trying to hit 144 or 240 Hz (or even more) on a monitor, there's a good case to be made for it. We also use a mix of ray-traced and non-ray-traced games. For the games we test with upscaling enabled, we use DLSS on Nvidia cards and the newest supported version of FSR (usually 2.x or 3.x) for AMD cards.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Though we've tested and re-tested multiple cards with recent drivers in our updated testbed, we don't have a 4070 Ti Super, 4070 Ti, or 3070 Ti available to test with. We've provided some numbers for those GPUs from past reviews; these are from a PC running older drivers and a Ryzen 7 7800X3D instead of a 9800X3D, and we've put asterisks next to them in our charts. They should still paint a reasonably accurate picture of the older GPUs' relative performance, but take them with that small grain of salt.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>Despite including fewer CUDA cores than either version of the 4080, some combination of architectural improvements and memory bandwidth increases help the card keep pace with both 4080 cards almost perfectly. In most of our tests, it landed in the narrow strip right in between the 4080 and the 4080 Super, and its power consumption under load was also almost identical.</p>




<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Benchmarks with DLSS/FSR and/or frame generation enabled.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>In every way that matters, the 5070 Ti is essentially an RTX 4080 that also supports DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. You can see why we'd be mildly enthusiastic about it at $749 but less and less impressed the closer the price creeps to $1,000.</p>
<p>Being close to a 4080 also means that the performance gap between the 5070 Ti and the 5080 is usually pretty small. In most of the games we tested, the 5070 Ti hovers right around 90 percent of the 5080's performance.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is also around 60 percent as fast as an RTX 5090. The performance is a lot lower, but the price-to-performance ratio is a lot higher, possibly reflecting the fact that the 5070 Ti actually has other GPUs it has to compete with (in non-ray-traced games, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX generally keeps pace with the 5070 Ti, though at this late date it is mostly out of stock unless you're willing to pay way more than you ought to for one).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>Compared to the old 4070 Ti, the 5070 Ti can be between 20 and 50 percent faster at 4K, depending on how limited the game is by the 4070 Ti's narrower memory bus and 12GB bank of RAM. The performance improvement over the 4070 Ti Super is more muted, ranging from as little as 8 percent to as much as 20 percent in our 4K tests. This is better than the RTX 5080 did relative to the RTX 4080 Super, but as a generational leap, it's still pretty modest—it's clear why Nvidia wants everyone to look at the Multi-Frame Generation numbers when making comparisons.</p>

<p>Being able to get RTX 4080-level performance for several hundred dollars less just a couple of years after the 4080 launched is kind of exciting, though that excitement is leavened by the still high-ish $749 price tag (again, assuming it's actually available at or anywhere near that price). That certainly makes it feel more like a next-generation GPU than the RTX 5080 did—and whatever else you can say about it, the 5070 Ti certainly feels like a better buy than the 5080.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is a fast and 4K-capable graphics card, fast enough that you should be able to get some good results from all of Blackwell's new frame-generation trickery if that's something you want to play with. Its price-to-performance ratio does not thrill me, but if you do the math, it's still a much better value than the 4070 Ti series was—particularly the original 4070 Ti, with the 12GB allotment of RAM that limited its usefulness and future-proofness at 4K.</p>
<p>Two reasons to hold off on buying a 5070 Ti, if you're thinking about it: We're waiting to see how AMD's 9070 series GPUs shake out, and Nvidia's 50-series launch so far has been kind of a mess, with low availability and price gouging both on retail sites and in the secondhand market. Pay much <em>more</em> than $749 for a 5070 Ti, and its delicate value proposition fades quickly. We should know more about the AMD cards in a couple of weeks. The supply situation, at least so far, seems like a problem that Nvidia can't (or won't) figure out how to solve.</p>

<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a starting price of $749, you get the approximate performance and power consumption of an RTX 4080, a GPU that cost $1,199 two years ago and $999 one year ago.</li>
<li>Good 4K performance and great 1440p performance for those with high-refresh monitors.</li>
<li>16GB of RAM should be reasonably future-proof.</li>
<li>Multi-Frame Generation is an interesting performance-boosting tool to have in your toolbox, even if it isn't a cure-all for low framerates.</li>
<li>Nvidia-specific benefits like DLSS support and CUDA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not all that much faster than a 4070 Ti Super.</li>
<li>$749 looks cheap compared to a $2,000 GPU, but it's still enough money to buy a high-end game console or an entire 1080p gaming PC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pricing and availability for other 50-series GPUs to date have both been kind of a mess.</li>
<li>Will you actually be able to get it for $749? Because it doesn't make a ton of sense if it costs more than $749.</li>
<li>Seriously, it's been months since I reviewed a GPU that was actually widely available at its advertised price.</li>
<li>And it's not just the RTX 5090 or 5080, it's low-end stuff like the Intel Arc B580 and B570, too.</li>
<li>Is it high demand? Low supply? Scalpers and resellers hanging off the GPU market like the parasites they are? No one can say!</li>
<li>It makes these reviews very hard to do.</li>
<li>It also makes PC gaming, as a hobby, really difficult to get into if you aren't into it already!</li>
<li>It just makes me mad is all.</li>
<li>If you're reading this months from now and the GPUs actually&nbsp;<em>are</em> in stock at the list price, I hope this was helpful.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Nintendo has released a <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Switch OLED bundle</a> featuring one of the console's best exclusive games: Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The bundle costs $350--the same price as the Switch OLED on its own--so you're essentially getting a digital copy of Nintendo's superb side-scrolling platformer for free. Mario Wonder still regularly sells for its full $60 MSRP. As an added bonus, the bundle also comes with a 3-month Switch Online individual membership ($8 value).</p><p>The <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch OLED bundle</a> is available now at Best Buy. We expect other major retailers, with the exception of Amazon, to stock the bundle soon.</p><p>Nintendo typically only releases new Switch console variants or bundles during the holidays and alongside big game launches--such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Hyrule-Edition-with-Bonus-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Expansion-Pack%2F9822067437%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder%2F1100-6529632%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom-themed Switch Lite</a> that launched last year.

Wonder is as good of a first game as any. The 2023 platformer offers an imaginative spin on the classic Super Mario side-scroller formula. It introduces multiple new gameplay features, including Mario's Elephant power-up and Wonder Flowers, which dynamically alter your surroundings in fun and creative ways. It earned a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-a-badge-of-honor/1900-6418136/" data-ref-id="1900-6418136">Super Mario Bros.
