            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> have gotten some disappointing news. The official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series, which was announced in 2019, has been quietly canceled. This news didn't come from an official press release but from one of the series' own voice actors.</p>

<p>The news of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series cancelation came from an interview <a href="https://collider.com/magic-the-gathering-netflix-series-cancelled/">by Collider</a> at this year's Toronto Independent Film Festival.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=8GYv-Ips 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=XaVYoEnC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Collider's own Steve Weintraub was interviewing Brandon Routh (<em>Superman Returns</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em></a>) for his upcoming horror comedy movie, <em>Ick</em>. Weintraub asked Routh about the status of the series since it was slated for a 2022 release. Routh's response was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm not sure. I did do a voice for it. As far as I understand, nobody's put out a press release about it, but apparently it's not happening. That's kind of old news. I'm not sure why it's surfacing again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Routh was set to voice the planeswalker Gideon Jura in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series. The series has gone through multiple producers, editors and creatives, including the Russo Brothers (<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>), Jose Melina (<em>Firefly</em>) and Bryan Cogman (<em>Game of Thrones</em>).</p>
<p>Despite being fully written and having voices fully recorded, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series was shelved alongside other animated Netflix projects. These included animated adaptations of the fantasy comic <em>Bone</em> and an animated <em>Gorillaz</em> movie directed by Jamie Hewlett.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=IBaK6gVr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=6fuDYS7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In retrospect, Netflix's shelving of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series is short-sighted. Recently, one of their original animated shows, the stylized historical action revenge series <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/blue-eye-samurai">won several Emmys</a> for Outstanding Individual Achievement, Sound Editing and for Outstanding Animated Program.</p>
<p>Given the scope of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, it is a ripe setting for stories. Larger-than-life stories of heroes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-eldritch-moon-spoilers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">monsters</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/duskmourn-house-of-horror-revealed-at-magiccon-amsterdamhttps://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ghosts</a>, eldritch horrors, angels, demons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interdimensional threats</a> are all present and plentiful.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there has been no official statement from Netflix regarding the status of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow will see the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>'s Realms Rebuilt update, which hopes to revive the ailing Early Access gaslamp survival craft 'em up. It's aiming to do that with a new handcrafted campaign, which now sits alongside the procedural worlds already present, along with new weapons, spells, boss battles, dungeons and much more, as the developers outlined yesterday in a new blog post.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The core questline of Nightingale has been completely recreated thanks to the incredible feedback we’ve received from the community," starts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4585315413747208446">the post</a>. "Realmwalkers now embark on a more immersive and substantive quest, as Puck guides players across gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests, and beyond, on a journey to reignite the ancient Crossway portals. Each of the new Storied Realms has been handcrafted; packed with challenging enemies, ancient discoveries, and all-new puzzles and dungeons."
</p>
<p>The update will lift some of Nightingale's build limits, allowing for the creation of "bigger and more elaborate" constructions. It also includes a new tileset for building with. 
</p>
<p>Players can also now adopt up to 20 pets, an increase on the original release, with several new pets now included. That includes cats, as per the bonnet-wearing chap in the screenshot above.
</p>
<p>There's also claims of an overhauled progression system, clothing customisation, simplified crafting, and UI improvements, according to the post.
</p>
<p>These changes do seem to take aim at many of the elements Ed criticised in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">Nightingale review</a> back in March. He criticised it as "an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind", calling it both confusing and tedious. 
</p>
<p>I'm glad that the developers are attempting to address those issues, although I'm skeptical that it will do much to attract players back to the game. Speaking for RPS, we won't be re-reviewing it before any potential 1.0 release, because there are simply too many games for us to write about them all - and I imagine many players feel similarly about their own precious time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, AMD won’t make you dive into a BIOS to reroute that power. The company’s new Variable Graphics Memory lets you turn up to 75 percent of your system memory into dedicated video RAM, just by tapping a button in AMD’s desktop Adrenalin app.</p><p>It’s only currently available for AMD AI 300 “Strix Point” laptops, and how much RAM you’ll be able to divert depends on your system’s total — <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/maximizing-gaming-performance-on-amd-ryzen-ai-300-series-with/ba-p/704594#:~:text=the%20best%20experience.-,Variable%20Graphics%20Memory,-is%20a%20newly">AMD explains</a> that the “medium” setting will turn a 32GB laptop that came with 512MB of video memory into a 24GB one with 8GB of dedicated VRAM. </p><p>You might be wondering: does that extra video memory actually make a difference? Well, it depends on the game. Some games, like <em>Alan Wake II, </em>require as many as 6GB of VRAM and will throw errors at launch if you’re short — Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go buyers have been tweaking their VRAM settings for some time to take games to the threshold of playability.</p><p>But in early testing with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">the Asus Zenbook S 16</a>, a Strix Point laptop that’s already shipped with this feature, my colleague Joanna Nelius saw that turning it on isn’t a silver bullet for every game. With 8GB of VRAM, the laptop played <em>Control</em> notably faster (65fps vs. 54fps), but some titles had smaller boosts, no boost, or even slight frame rate decreases.</p><p>Your mileage will vary — but I’m eager to find out if it’s a big boost in particular games!</p><div><p>AMD’s also bringing its Fluid Motion Frames 2 to Strix Point laptops in technical preview today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139440/the-asus-rog-ally-is-getting-amds-fluid-motion-frames-tomorrow">after previously opening it up to desktop GPUs and last-gen notebook GPUs</a>. It increases frame rate by imagining new frames, now with less jitter and lag. </p></div><p>There, AMD says you can get substantial boosts combined with VGM, assuming you’ve got at least 50fps to work with before you apply the frame-generating technique — though AMD doesn’t say whether you’re getting any more frames with AFMF 2 than you did with the original version of the tech. </p><p>The company does claim, though, that if your laptop can already manage 39fps in, say, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, you can now play it at a (theoretically) smooth 66fps on a 2880 x 1800 laptop screen if you combine AFMF2, VGM, and AMD’s FSR upscaling tech.</p><p>In other AMD laptop gaming news, the company’s just announced <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/laptops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7800m.html">the RX 7800M</a>, a new up-to-180W chip that comes with 12GB of dedicated video memory. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-silently-launches-rx-7800m-gpu-mobile-navi-32-with-12gb-of-vram"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em> calls it</a> “essentially a stripped-down RX 7800 XT,” comparing it to the desktop GPU, but it’s also filling a huge hole in AMD’s lineup between the flagship RX 7900M and the RX 7600M XT, as you can see below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been ten long years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, which means the next game in the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - likely has some modern design trends to catch up on. Here's one: The Veilguard will be the first game in the series to include a photo mode when it arrives in October.
</p>

<p>IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dragon-age-the-veilguards-photo-mode-mass-effects-15-exclusive-screenshots">has the first details on the photo mode</a>, including a spread of new screenshots.

<p>The photo mode sounds like it's got a large if typical suite of camera features, including: free-roaming camera, focal length, depth of field, auto-focus, F-stop, controls for saturation, brightness and contrast, and the ability to hide the player, party members, enemies or NPCs.
</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is due for release October 31st.
</p>
<p>Optimism seems to be growing around The Veilguard, as I see more and more fans of the series getting excited based on the trailers and streams BioWare have released so far. Edwin saw the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in the summer</a> and came away intrigued by its characters and action, even if it's not the full party-based RPG offered by some of the previous games.
</p>
<p>I've never played a Dragon Age, but I have spent several hours messing around in photo modes, trying to bring out my inner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/dead-end-thrills">Dead End Thrills</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, they are doing something a bit different with their next game. <em>Byte Breakers </em>is a 4o-player battle-royale spin on platformer fighters. Or to put it another way: It’s like<em> Fortnite x Smash Bros</em>. And this time, Odyssey Interactive wants people to play the game very early so they can decide if this prototype is worth making and supporting. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jMz0jxxT2Xw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jMz0jxxT2Xw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On September 11</a></span>, Odyssey Interactive developers Lunchboy and Maple announced that for the last eight months, the team had been working on various prototypes for their potential next game. And the first one they are going to let the community play around with is <em>Byte Breakers. </em></p><p>“With <em>Omega Strikers</em> we learned firsthand the risks of keeping things under wraps for too long and we felt the pain of having to move on from something that we poured three years of our passion into,” explained the devs. “For all of our next projects, we want to hear what you think much earlier.”</p><p>Odyssey Interactive says that in the next “few days” they’ll be holding a playtest on Steam where a “few thousand” people will be able to hop in and play a very, very early build of <em>Byte Breakers</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can sign up to play on the game’s newly launched Steam page</a></span>. </p><p>“[The playtest will be] fully public so feel free to talk about it with your friends, make videos about it, or even stream it. We want to hear what you honestly think,” said the devs. </p><p>But don’t assume that <em>Byte Breakers</em> is guaranteed to be finished and released. Odyssey Interactive is very clear that it might not end up making <em>Byte Breakers</em> or other games based on player feedback during these early tests. </p><div><p>“We may not end up actually making this prototype,” said the studio. “We may not end up making the next prototype we show you either. But we think that this type of public testing is the best way of figuring out if our ideas have juice. We trust you and we trust your feedback. So get in there and let us know what you think.”</p><p>It’s an interesting strategy that feels reminiscent of how Valve is building its next game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-deadlock-early-access-beta-steamdb-pc-1851620354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-deadlock-early-access-beta-steamdb-pc-1851620354"><em>Deadlock</em></a></span>. For years now, early access has been a part of gaming, with devs releasing unfinished games and building upon them alongside the community. But with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341"><em>Deadlock</em></a></span><em> </em>and <em>Byte Breakers,</em> the studios and devs are bringing players even earlier, less finished prototypes and ideas and going, “Hey, what do you think of this?”</p></div><p> In an industry obsessed with secrecy, it’s a nice change. It also will hopefully help teams avoid spending three years or more on an online game that nobody wants. And that could mean fewer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-live-service-games-failed-flopped-lawbreakers-1851639061&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-live-service-games-failed-flopped-lawbreakers-1851639061">expensive flops that lead to shutdowns and layoffs</a></span>.

<p>Ready to kick off your streaming career? To do that, though, you want to make sure you have the best streaming settings for OBS ready to go. Without good settings, your stream will look laggy and grainy. No one wants that! Here are the best OBS settings for streaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-streaming-settings-for-obs">Best Streaming Settings For OBS</h2>



<p>Having the best streaming settings for OBS does depend a bit on your PC specs. Those with a little bit lower-end PC might not have the bitrate turned up as high as streamers who have an expensive high-end PC will have. If your PC does not run the settings listed in this article well, then you will obviously have to do some readjusting.</p>



<p>Here are the best streaming settings for OBS.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-streaming-dimensions">Streaming Dimensions</h3>



<p>You first want to set up your dimensions in OBS. It is recommended that streamers use <strong>1920×1080 resolution</strong>, also known as 1080p. Some PCs, though, might struggle to handle these dimensions. If that is the case, then going down to <strong>1280×720</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> is okay.</p>



<p>You will want to make sure your base settings in OBS are set to this resolution, plus your output settings, which you can change in the normal OBS Settings tab.</p>



<h3 id="h-fps">FPS</h3>



<p>After your streaming dimensions are set, you will want to adjust your FPS. We recommend utilizing <strong>60 FPS</strong>. If your PC cannot handle this high of an FPS, though, then switch to <strong>30 FPS</strong>. If your computer cannot handle 30 FPS, then it may be time for a new PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-at-1080p-and-60-fps">Best OBS Settings For Streaming At 1080p And 60 FPS</h2>



<p>Once you have your stream set to 1080p and 60 FPS, you will be ready to adjust additional settings. </p>



<h3 id="h-bitrate">Bitrate</h3>



<p>One of the most important settings to adjust first is the <strong>bitrate</strong>. Bitrate is the number of bits of information that can be transmitted per unit of time. Higher-end PCs can obviously have a higher bitrate, but no one needs too high of a bitrate. It is recommended you set your bitrate between <strong>3,000 and 4,000 Kbps</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-cpu-usage">CPU Usage</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>When trying to get the best streaming settings in OBS, you will need to adjust your CPU Usage. Remember, though, if you are streaming and gaming on the same PC, utilizing too much CPU when streaming will make your game incredibly laggy.</p>



<p>When adjusting your CPU Usage, it is best to allow your CPU to use only 60% of its potential. Having your setting set to a faster setting will allow it to work better. Just don’t set the speed too high, or else the stream will look grainy. </p>



<p>We recommend your CPU Usage be set to <strong>Fast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-on-a-bad-pc">Best OBS Settings For Streaming On A Bad PC</h2>



<p>Your best bet when adjusting your OBS settings for streaming on a bad PC is to take all the settings listed above and lower them. Sure, the quality of your stream will go down, but at least it is not laggy and destroying your computer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-with-bad-internet">Best OBS Settings For Streaming With Bad Internet</h2>



<p>Have bad internet and still want to stream? If you are not able to upgrade your internet, then here are a few solutions to making your streaming experience a bit more enjoyable.</p>



<p>First off, make sure your PC is plugged into an ethernet. Being plugged in directly to your router will always allow for your stream to run more smoothly.</p>



<p>Secondly, lower your bitrate. Yes, this will make your stream a bit more grainy, but it will also relieve some of the stress being put on your internet.</p>



<p>Hopefully, all of this advice helps. Happy streaming!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-starting-location-in-satisfactory-isn%E2%80%99t-grass-fields.978426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-starting-location-satisfactory/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When you first boot up Satisfactory, whether it’s your first time playing or a returning player checking out the recent 1.0 launch, you’ll have a few options. When starting a new game, you have four maps to select: Grass Fields, Rocky Desert, Northern Forest, and Dune Desert. The first map, Grass Fields, is the recommended starting point for new pioneers. The second recommended location is the Rocky Desert. I don’t recommend either of those, though. Instead, here’s the best starting location in Satisfactory, as recommended by someone who has played the game since its earliest days in Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-start-in-satisfactory">Where to Start in Satisfactory</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of choosing one of the usual starting locations—Grass Fields or Rocky Desert—I recommend you take a chance and start your journey in the Dune Desert. Sure, it’s a more challenging environment, specifically regarding power production, as the game tells you, but it also offers the most usable space for a large factory. Furthermore, within walking distance of the starting spawn, you’ll find a number of valuable resources necessary to push into the mid- and late-game.</p>



<p>That said, alongside power generation, you’ll find it’s tough to find specific late-game resources, including oil and uranium. You can find them, of course, but you’ll travel a bit further. But the same can be said about any of the game’s starting locations. They all have pros and cons in each column to consider. </p>



<p>At the end of the day, the starting location you choose in Satisfactory depends on your comfort level. If you don’t mind a challenge, I’ll recommend the Dune Desert all day. But if you want to take things slow, learning the game’s mechanics at a casual pace, then the Grass Fields are the go-to for many new players.</p>







<h2 id="h-satisfactory-starting-tips-and-tricks">Satisfactory Starting Tips and Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Take your time! There’s no rush in Satisfactory, as you can build the factory of your dreams slowly, expanding across the planet and progressing to the next tech level at your pace.</li>



<li>Unless they altered any values recently, the biomass burner on the hub isn’t as efficient as the one you can build, so consider using your resources wisely.</li>



<li>You need power for everything in Satisfactory, and the starting materials—leaves and wood—won’t suffice. You must automate biomass and use that to burn for energy.</li>



<li>You can deconstruct any structure and receive a full refund, so don’t worry about where you place everything now. You can beautify and focus on efficiency down the line.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-is-bringing-back-friend-requests-for-the-first-time-since-the-xbox-360-era<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Xbox is bringing back friend requests for the first time since the Xbox 360 era — a decade and two console generations after they first went away.</p><p>The long-requested feature will be will be <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/11/new-xbox-friends-and-followers-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible to Xbox Insiders starting this week</a>, as well as those who have joined the PC Gaming preview on Windows PC and handheld devices like the ROG Ally. It will let users "easily send, accept, or delete friend requests," and will make friends on Xbox a "two-way, invite-approved relationship." Users will also be able to continue to separately follow their favorite creators on Xbox.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/11/1-xbox-ecosystem-friend-request-ed2e438bb2a6cf512b52-1726080958528.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox Friend requests are finally coming back after more than a decade. Image source: Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p>If you're feeling confused about how all of this works, you're not the only one. In the current system, adding another user to your list makes them a follower until they also add you to their friends list. With no notifications, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of friends on Xbox's platforms.</p><p>The system, which was first introduced more than a decade ago with the Xbox One, has never been especially popular. There have been periodic calls to bring back friend requests, which were a simple and relatively straightforward way to connect with players you met online during the Xbox 360 era.</p><p>"I understand why they phased out the requests. They wanted to make it so you can follow your favorite streamer and whatnot without them needing to approve the "friendship", but why get rid of any sort of sustained notification whatsoever," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/9e8eu7/bring_back_friend_requests_please/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user grumbled back in 2018</a>. "As far as I can tell, if you're not online to receive the pop up notification the instant someone friends you, you're SoL for knowing they did. Earlier I was playing Sea of Thieves and someone from my crew friended me. I was currently busy at the time, so I couldn't reciprocate."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/11/2-xbox-console-friend-request-e94747f063fa197619f7-1726081420002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Friend requests are available through the People tab. Image source: Xbox.</figcaption></figure></output><p>According to Xbox's post, existing friends and followers will update automatically with this change. If someone isn't currently a Friend, you'll be able to send them a request through the People tab. Xbox says it will also add new privacy and notification settings to manage friend requests. Xbox did not indicate when the feature would become widely available to current users.</p><p>In the meantime, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-x-games">best Xbox Series X|S games to play right now</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241002/playstation-5-ps5-pro-comparison-differences-specs-software-ray-tracing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After various rumors and leaks, the PlayStation 5 Pro is finally official — complete with a new GPU, $700 price point, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price"> no built-in disc drive</a>. But is that pretty much it? What makes this new console 40 percent more expensive than the existing PS5 you can buy today for $500? The same one that’s bound to go on sale during the holidays, not long after the Pro’s November 7th launch date.</p><p>What are the differences between the PS5 and PS5 Pro that make it (depending who you ask) a worthwhile upgrade or a superfluous expense?</p><p><h3>Spec and performance differences</h3></p><p>The PS5 Pro has three core performance improvements over the standard PS5, according to Sony’s<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX24BzyzQQ-8%26rco%3D1"> technical presentation announcement</a>, hosted by PS5 lead architect, Mark Cerny. It’s got a new, more powerful GPU for more compute power and faster rendering; advanced ray tracing for improved in-game reflections and more immersive lighting; and a new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaler to keep frame rates high without sacrificing resolution and image quality.</p><p>The GPU is really the star of the show, as Sony is saying it promises to have 67 percent more compute units and 28 percent faster memory yielding 45 percent faster rendering. But the CPU and storage speed in the PS5 Pro is unchanged, so while it should deliver 4K resolution <em>and</em> maintain 60 fps or greater, it’s possible the console won’t load or boot up games any faster.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s still no looker like the PS4 and PS2 were.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The biggest change for current PS5 owners here is that playing on a PS5 Pro will no longer require choosing between Performance and Fidelity modes (the decision many current games force on users for either prioritizing frame rate smoothness <em>or </em>crisper visuals). But Sony could just move those goal posts with the PS5 Pro, since the upcoming console also supports 8K gaming. It’s possible Performance and Fidelity modes will still be with us if playing games in 8K means once again sacrificing frame rate — which it’s sure to do. The difference there is that most people will not care, because<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18177493/tvs-ces-2019-8k-samsung-lg-oled-rollable-micro-led-trends"> who the hell owns an 8K TV</a> right now?</p><p>As for ray tracing, that’s a feature that’s been supported in the PS5 since launch. But the PS5 Pro’s <em>advanced</em> ray tracing is promising to make it better, with more dynamic reflections and light refractions. Basically, games with pretty lighting and lots of reflections should look a bit prettier (rejoice,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22958005/gran-turismo-7-review-ps5-ps4"> <em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> fans). So far, ray tracing on the current PS5 has been a little lackluster compared to what’s possible on PCs with high-end GPUs (which, to be fair, cost more than a PS5 Pro on their own). But that’s more to do with the games themselves than the console. Many titles aren’t optimized for ray tracing on console, although there have been some PS5 standouts like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> that have good ray tracing performance. The PS5 Pro should just make them look better without compromising for the sake of frame rates.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>PSSR (no, don’t try to pronounce that) can tidy up details, like this background in </em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart<em>, while the frame rates are kept high.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The PSSR AI-driven upscaler is the most technical software trick of the PS5 Pro’s features. It’s a lot like Nvidia’s popular DLSS feature on PCs, and it’s a post-processing asset that helps achieve higher frame rates at high resolutions. The standard PS5 uses more conventional anti-aliasing, while the PS5 Pro will utilize machine learning to scale things based on what’s being actively rendered on your screen. It’s one of those things that works in the background to tidy up small details.</p><p>Another way the PS5 Pro should be more performant than the current PS5 is its support for Wi-Fi 7 (the PS5 has Wi-Fi 6, and never even made the jump to 6E when the Slim came out). That may be helpful with downloading massive games to the Pro’s 2TB internal SSD at faster speeds, but only if your home network supports Wi-Fi 7 — which most people have not yet adopted due to the cost involved. Notably this feature will not help Remote Play on the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review"> PlayStation Portal</a>, as Sony’s one-trick pony handheld for console streaming is bafflingly limited to Wi-Fi <em>5</em>.</p><p><h3>Physical hardware differences (what we know so far)</h3></p><p>Outside of the new GPU and the remixed cooling system it will require, the biggest physical differences in the PS5 Pro are its design and the absence of a disc drive. The Pro will be tall and long like the original PS5, but with the thinness of the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions"> revised Slim model</a>. It has a new finned design element across the side slashes on its removable plates (which Sony will sell customizable replacements for at a later time).&nbsp; Personally, I think it’s still a bit ugly, and I fear Sony’s refusal to show the front of the console in horizontal orientation means there’s another weird trick planned to let it rest on its side. The Slim used silly-looking little legs like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_saver">pizza saver</a> to keep it balanced. I’d hate for the pricier Pro to do the same.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the only view of the PS5 Pro in horizontal position we’ve got so far. I’m wagering there are some hilarious little removable legs under there like the slim.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The lack of a disc drive can be remedied by purchasing the same $79.99 modular drive Sony already sells for the PS5 slim. So instead of having the option for buying a PS5 Pro with or without a disc drive (the practice Sony started with the very first PS5 at launch), you’re only left high and dry to get your own. It’s fair to think a “pro” console calls for all the bells and whistles, including physical media that some diehards may prefer, but this may just be the start of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">digital-only future</a> for the next generation of consoles. And at least the M.2 slot is maintained on the Pro, for adding even more speedy storage.</p><div><figcaption><em>This time you have to supply your own ugly bump on the side that is the disc drive.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Another bit of ever-changing I/O on PS5 consoles are the USB ports, which on the PS5 Pro continues the slow march toward being nearly entirely USB-C. Here’s a simple breakdown of the USB ports on all three PlayStation 5 consoles since launch:</p><div><ul><li>PlayStation 5 (original): One USB-C and one USB-A on the front / Two USB-A on the rear</li><li>PS5 (slim): Two USB-C on the front / Two USB-A on the rear</li><li>PS5 Pro: Two USB-C on the front / One USB-C and one USB-A on the rear</li></ul></div><p>So you still get four USB ports in total on the PS5 Pro (thankfully) and most of them are USB-C. We don’t know how fast each of them are on the Pro, but considering both the<a href="https://gmedia.playstation.com/is/image/SIEPDC/ps5-support-USB-ports-01-04nov20?$1600px$"> original PS5</a> and<a href="https://gmedia.playstation.com/is/image/SIEPDC/support-cfi-2k-usb-ports-06nov23$en?$1600px$"> the slim</a> have three SuperSpeed 10Gbps ports and one slower port it’s likely a safe bet the Pro will follow suit.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The four USB ports of the original PS5.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>The revised USB ports of the slim PS5. The asterisk denotes which port the PSVR 2 must use.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>One thing that is not changing are the controllers. The PS5 Pro will ship with the same old white DualSense controller, complete with its potentiometer-based analog sticks that can develop drift over time. The Pro would have been a nice opportunity for the DualSense to switch to drift-free Hall effect sticks, but no such luck.</p><p><h3>Who is the PlayStation 5 Pro for?</h3></p><p>This is the second console generation with a mid-cycle “Pro” model release, and while the PS4 Pro seemed to be generally well received in 2016, let’s not forget it launched at the PS4’s original price of $400 alongside a <em>cheaper </em>slim model. The market is much different now, with the slim PS5 offering no price reduction (aside from the occasional bundled game) and the PS5 Pro coming at a steep $700 (or $780 with the add-on disc drive).</p><p>The PS5 Pro seems mostly for the PlayStation superfans who might just buy it at nearly any price. But there are other people who are looking for something they can just turn on and play — no messing with drivers or dealing with the configurations and costs of a gaming PC. For those people, the PS5 Pro feels like a great option, even if the cost might have them balking at first.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players who have the title unlocked, which requires completing a bunch of 10th anniversary content, and buy the toy replica will also get an exotic ornament for Ace of Spades called “Pocket Ace” that looks just like the NERF version and drops when <em>Destiny</em>’s Episode 2 Revenant update arrives on October 8. </p><p>That’s how an artist who goes by Tofu discovered that what seemed like her work was being used for the game. “I achieved the in-game title of ‘Legend’ and the game prompted me with an ad telling me I could buy the nerf gun,” she told <em>Kotaku</em>. “I clicked on it just to check it out and had that ‘wait a second, this looked familiar’ moment when I saw it.”</p><p> Tofu had made a stylized print of Ace of Spades back in 2015 for a friend when it was first added to the game as an obtainable exotic weapon in <em>The Taken King</em> expansion. “The engravings, the painted stripes, are all details that do not appear in the game so I got suspicious right away,” she said. “When I then checked my original files that I still have in my archive I noticed that no, it was literally 1:1, you can clearly see scratches and swirls in the engravings matching perfectly.”</p><p>She shared a comparison online including breakouts of all the parts that seemed to match her design in a tweet aimed at getting Bungie’s attention. “While I’m obviously disappointed I don’t blame Bungie for this, I know they outsource this kind of work and this is obviously a case of a contractor cutting corners,” Tofu said. “And, when this has happened in the past Bungie has apologized and been on top of it so, I am remaining hopeful.”</p><p>Bungie didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here at Ars, we've been publicly musing about whether the world was ready for a disc-free game console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">since as far back as 2015</a>. Now, though, the better question might be whether the world ever needs a new game console with a built-in disc drive at all.
</p><p>Yesterday's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> seemed to treat the existence of disc-based games as an afterthought. You had to be watching pretty closely during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdEBSx--XSc">Mark Cerny's "technical presentation" video</a> to notice that the coming PS5 Pro is only available in a single disc-drive-free model. And you'd have to read pretty deep into <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">the official PlayStation blog post</a> on the subject to discover that "PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately."
</p><p>That <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">$80 disc drive accessory</a> was introduced as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/ps5-slims-new-external-disc-drive-requires-online-pairing-before-use/">an optional upgrade</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">the Digital Edition of the PS5 Slim</a> last year, alongside a Slim model that <em>does</em> have a pre-installed disc drive. But now, just one year later, Sony has decided that it only needs a single "disc-less" model of the PS5 Pro as the default.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Want to let your Digital Edition PS5 Slim (or PS5 Pro) play physical games? An $80 snap-on disc drive can help with that.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>On Microsoft's side, things seem to be trending away from console disc drives as well. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/microsoft-reveals-first-disc-less-xbox-series-x/">new Xbox models the company is releasing this holiday season</a> include the first "all-digital" edition of its top-end Xbox Series X, available for about $50 less than the standard edition. Microsoft is also introducing a new "Galaxy Black" Xbox Series X model with a disc drive this holiday season, but it will only be available "in limited quantities," Microsoft said.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Things have come a long way since 2013, when Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/microsoft-considered-disc-free-xbox-one-as-late-as-mid-2013/">privately mulled a disc-free version of the Xbox One</a> before scrapping the plans because of what Phil Spencer called "bandwidth and game size" concerns (the "All-Digital" Xbox One S would eventually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/everything-we-know-about-the-first-discless-xbox-one-console-coming-may-7/">limp out in 2019</a>). Things have even changed considerably since 2020, when Gamestop's initial allotment of PS5 units <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/ps5-retailers-have-many-fewer-digital-edition-systems-for-pre-order/">was tilted 3-to-1 toward standard, disc-drive-equipped model</a>, according to Ars' analysis.</p>
<h2>A shrinking minority</h2>
<p>It's hard to read too much of the disc-free console hardware trend for the moment. The original editions of the PS5 and Xbox Series X still exist with disc drives, of course. And on Sony's side, that optional disc drive attachment exists as an important release valve for any PS5 Pro customers who want to pay more to enjoy games on discs.</p>
<p>But Sony's statistics suggest there's no need to treat physical game discs as the default anymore. Digital downloads represented <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1cs13sj/the_digital_ratio_for_full_game_software_sales_on/">70 percent of PlayStation's full game sales for the 2023 fiscal year</a> (ending March 2024) and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/07/nearly-80percent-of-all-ps5-ps4-games-are-bought-digitally">nearly 80 percent of such sales</a> for the April to June quarter of 2024. That's up from downloads representing 53 percent of PlayStation game sales in the 2019 fiscal year and way up from 19 percent in the 2015 fiscal year.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>The number of physical console game releases continues to decline even as the number of digital game explodes.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The numbers are similar across the industry. For years now, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">most distinct console games have not been released as a physical product</a>, a trend that now includes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">major games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>. Third-party publishers like Capcom report that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/despite-90-of-its-sales-now-digital-capcom-claims-it-wont-stop-producing-physical-games/">90 percent of their sales now come from purely digital games</a>. In the UK, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/82-of-street-fighter-final-fantasy-diablo-and-f1-sales-were-digital-uk-monthly-charts">downloads represented 82 percent</a> of sales for the most popular new console releases in June 2023.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Given trends and numbers like that, why would Sony or Microsoft think a pre-installed disc drive should even be a relevant option for any gaming console going forward? Why would a console maker assume a critical mass of consumers want to spend an extra $50 or more for a disc drive they may never use?</p>
<p>Why not consolidate down to a single, disc-free model as the default and relegate physical games to "needs a weird peripheral" status? The PS5 Pro's disc-free release suggests Sony is now ready to treat disc-based gamers like virtual reality fans—a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/putting-sonys-4-2-million-psvr-sales-in-context/">small slice of the market</a> that needs to invest in non-standard hardware to play in their non-standard way.</p>
<h2>Long overdue</h2>
<p>This doesn't mean physical games are going away soon. There's still a sizable minority of gamers who want to own their games on physical media for valid reasons, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sonys-axed-concord-is-surprise-collectors-item-disc-prices-rise-175/">collectability</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/modern-gaming-is-a-challenge-for-those-without-high-speed-internet/">accessibility</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/87-of-classic-games-are-out-of-print-thats-a-problem-for-gaming-history/">long-term preservation</a>. Major publishers and <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/">specialist outfits like Limited Run Games</a> will continue to cater to this market segment for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>This image, like game rentals as a whole, is now a relic of a bygone era.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to gaming hardware, though, the final push away from built-in console disc drives as the standard is overdue. On the PC, Steam made buying a disc drive for your gaming rig <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/is-there-a-reason-for-a-pc-gamer-to-need-a-blu-ray-drive.1473909/">feel like an anachronism</a> years ago. In music, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/06/apple-muscles-past-amazon-to-number-three-position-in-music-sales/">the iPod</a> and then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/record-companies-made-2-4b-last-year-from-streaming-but-its-not-enough/">streaming services</a> have led stores like Best Buy to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbyowsinski/2018/07/07/best-buy-cd-sales/">stop selling physical CDs altogether</a> (though vinyl sales are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/sales-of-vinyl-albums-overtake-cds-for-the-first-time-since-the-late-80s/">a small but growing niche</a>). In film, sales and rentals of movies on disc <a href="https://buttondown.com/diversetechgeek/archive/2023-us-home-video-revenue-streaming-dominates/">now represent just 3.6 percent of home movie spending</a>, dwarfed by both digital sales and rentals (a combined 10 percent) and subscription streaming (86.3 percent).</p>
<p>Console gaming now seems poised to be the next media format where physical media no longer drives the hardware market. Soon, the idea of a game console with a disc drive may seem as outdated as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/from-the-wirecutter-the-best-external-blu-ray-drive/">a laptop with a disc drive</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/no-headphone-jack-nintendo-did-it-first/">an iPhone with a headphone jack</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pubg-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-561140">PUBG Mobile</a> is taking action against climate change with a new Play for Green initiative, one that lets players battle it out on a version of the game's iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-is-bringing-back-the-original-erangel-map-for-a-limited-time/1100-6522901/" data-ref-id="1100-6522901">Erangel map</a> ravaged by climate change.</p><p dir="ltr">The map is a collaboration between PUBG Mobile developers Lightspeed Studios and Krafton in conjunction with University College London professor Mark Maslin, who has written multiple books on the dangers of climate change. Using Maslin's research, the PUBG Mobile development team reimagined what the ruins of Erangel would look like 100 years from now given the current rate of climate change if no further action is taken. That translated into Erangel becoming an apocalyptic hellscape, one plagued by sandstorms, drought, and largely devoid of plant life.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to explore the map themselves, there's two modes featuring the climate-ravaged Ruins of Erangel. One, Ruins of Erangel: Sandstorm is the battle royale experience PUBG players are familiar with, as players struggle to survive against not only sandstorms but other players. Ruins of Erangel: Exploration is a narrative version of the map that guides players through the progressive effects of climate change to the map's environment.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all in conjunction with a new "Run for Green" in-game challenge going from September 11-24. During that time, the game will keep track of the distance the PUBG Mobile community runs in-game, with progress contributing towards milestones that will help aid projects looking to preserve natural environments in Brazil, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Players will also unlock in-game customization items and a special garden in the game's Home mode that can be outfitted with endangered trees and plants by progressing the Run for Green campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Endangered California Redwood and Giant Baobab trees are additionally being added for use in the game's creative World of Wonder. Creative-minded players who create variants of the climate-change ravaged Ruins of Erangel map using the new items will have their work judged by the PUBG Mobile team and be eligible to win a share of a $12,500 prize pool. If players collectively play the official new Play for Green map or user-created ones 10 million times, the PUBG Mobile team will double their contribution to the environmental projects chosen as part of the campaign.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365757" data-ratio="0.56469708302169" data-width="1337" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365757"></a><figcaption>The Run for Green event will see players unlock in-game rewards as well as help protect natural resources.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4365757-pubgrunforgreenevent.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The event is part of the Playing for the Planet initiative, an alliance of video game companies pledging to help reduce the environmental impact of the video game industry and supported by the United Nations Environment Programme. Both Xbox and Sony are members of the initiative, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-to-be-first-carbon-neutral-game-console-with-/1100-6470034/" data-ref-id="1100-6470034">Xbox testing the creation of carbon neutral consoles</a>. According to a global survey of PUBG: Mobile players earlier this year, 88% of players who participated were concerned about climate change, with an even larger percentage stating they have already experienced the effects of climate change in their country.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincent Wang, head of PUBG Mobile publishing at Tencent Games, said in a press release that the power of gaming can be used to help address one of the biggest challenges of our time.</p><p dir="ltr">"With initiatives like the Ruins of Erangel maps and the Run for Green event, we're not just creating immersive content for our players--we're inspiring a global community to take real-world action," Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Play for Green initiative is just the latest event to come to PUBG Mobile. A limited-time event last year added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-is-adding-dinosaurs-and-it-looks-awesome/1100-6514248/" data-ref-id="1100-6514248">dinosaurs to the battle royale</a>, and the mobile game is no stranger to collaborations with other franchises, including anime <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pubg-mobile-x-dragon-ball-super-official-crossover-trailer/2300-6464420/" data-ref-id="2300-6464420">Dragon Ball Super</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pubg-mobile-spyxfamily-collaboration-live-now/2300-6463883/" data-ref-id="2300-6463883">Spy x Family</a>.</p>

            <p>
Starbreeze Studios has announced major changes to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>'s creative leadership team - with former game director Miodrag Kovačevićas "stepping away" from the role - as the co-operative shooter continues to struggle against its decade-old predecessor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">admitted</a> Payday 3 player activity was "currently at significantly lower levels than [it] would like", and a month later, CEO Tobias Sjögren was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">ousted from his role</a> after the company's board determined the studio "needs a different leadership". But a quick look at Steam Charts suggests Payday 3's playerbase continues to be dwarfed by that of its predecessor: Payday 3 saw a <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1272080">monthly average</a> of around 844 Steam players in August - its highest monthly average since December last year - while Payday 2 <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/218620">attracted</a> 15,508 players (the game's <em>lowest</em> monthly average since December last year). 
</p>
<p>
And now Starbreeze has confirmed yet more leadership changes as it continues its efforts to attract more players to Payday 3. "As we are nearing our first anniversary for Payday 3, and the start of our second year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1833868133691511218">statement shared on social media</a>, "we wanted to give a brief update on the Payday 3 leadership."

<p>
"Going into year 2," it continued, "[Miodrag Kovačevićas] will be stepping away from his former role as game director, and focusing his efforts as a designer elsewhere on the project. In the interim while researching and planning year 2, [Andreas Häll Penninger and Almir Listo] will be the creative force behind the upcoming updates we hope you keep enjoying and playing".
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging his new duties in a <a href="https://x.com/almirlisto/status/1833869599009317281">separate post</a>, Listo - Payday's global brand director and head of community - wrote, "I have worked on the Payday franchise for the past 12 years together, and I am thrilled about the upcoming content we are preparing for you all! Thank you for your continued support - we salute you."
</p>
<p>
On its release last year, Payday 3 struggled with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">matchmaking issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, while its first major patch was hit with repeated delays, eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">arriving</a> two months after the game's troubled launch. Since then Starbreeze has released two additional major bug fixing patches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">under the name Operation Medic Bag</a>, and introduced an early <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-is-finally-getting-an-offline-mode">offline mode</a>. Amid all this, the studio revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a Dungeons and Dragons game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars</a> last year, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."

			<p>Today, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-the-plucky-squire-night-in-the-woods-under-the-waves-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> dropped on the PlayStation website, announcing the PlayStation Plus game catalog for September. Compared to previous months, this month seems to be a heavy focus on indie games, with it getting the most recent release of The Plucky Squire, which will be a day-one release for PlayStation Plus. Those who have an active PlayStation Plus Premium or PlayStation Plus Extra will get access to these games and can own them until their subscription runs out.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the headliner, joined by games such as Night in the Woods and Under the Waves, new classics, and a PS VR2 game offering to those who are on PlayStation Plus Premium, which includes the game Pistol Whip. All of the games being added to PlayStation Plus will be available from September 17.</p>
<p>In addition to the game mentioned, games such as Chernobylite, Wild Card Football, Space Engineers, Road 96, Ben 10, and Far Cry 5 are being added to September's catalog, giving players a lot of variety and games for all the family. Far Cry 5 has been in the PlayStation Plus catalog before and is being re-released again for PlayStation 4 users.</p>
<p>Regarding PS VR2 and classics being added to the list, Pistol Whip is the main PS VR2 game that will be available to play and is the only PS VR2 game on the PlayStation Plus September catalog. However, for those who want a hit of nostalgia, games such as Secret Agent Clank, Sky Gunner, and Mister Mosquito are all being added to the PlayStation Plus September lineup.</p>
<p>Already, the comments under the blog post are not happy with this month's lineup. People say last month was terrible, and this month is giving away games that are already on sale, which feels disingenuous to some of the PlayStation gamers out there. However, some people are happy with the games, especially with games such as Under the Waves, Sky Gunner, and Mr. Mosquito being some of the more hyped-up games in the comments for those who want a hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Overall, Sony appears to be in murky water regarding&nbsp;<span>its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> announcement. The console costs</span>&nbsp;an exorbitant amount of money, not including a disk drive and stand. On top of that, the PlayStation Plus catalog has been predominantly disappointing for gamers for multiple months now, with nothing seeming to be worth adding to the library, according to some of the comments.</p>

</ul>

<p>In our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, Jason said, <em>“I find myself wishing Shadow of the Erdtree had a continuation from one of the endings of Elden Ring, or ventured back to explore the Shattering itself. Instead, it feels like a filler episode in Naruto. Sure, the fights are cool, and there’s a new progression system to work through, but what is the point if nobody is going to acknowledge it again for the rest of the series. But hey, at least the Convergence Mod team will have a field day with all of this new stuff to play with.”</em></p>
