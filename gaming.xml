            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> has popped up on Wired's (fantastic) Tech Support series (did you know that we're closer in time <a href="https://youtu.be/E7oEq6CE78g?si=dhAH__k4FyEl0vzp&amp;t=9">to Cleopatra than Cleopatra is to the beginning of ancient Egypt</a>?) answering questions about – well, himself, in the main.</p>
<p>While the web series has featured game developers before - including Dead Space creator and Sledgehammer Games co-founder, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXdJU9ZUX8">Glen Schofield</a> - this interview was purely about Kojima himself and how he sets about writing, making, and even assessing his own video games.</p>

<p>Kojima said a number of interesting things - including how important it is that you feel "the creator's love" in games, and encouraging player experimentation - but also opened up about his well-documented love of movies, the future of gaming, and how he tries to make a world that "makes you want to stay and play".</p>
<p>He also said that he doesn't "have" experts that offer specialised science or history knowledge, which is why he studies "daily", reading literature, watching documentaries and news specials, as well as researching things online or at the library.</p>
<p>"If you're watching and thinking, 'I'll be Kojima's right-hand man!' please contact me," he joked.</p>
<p>There's also a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into how he personally tests and tunes his games, including listening with both headphones and speakers, tweaking difficulty, and "fixing story pacing issues".</p>
<p>"It's a very crucial stage," he said. "Not many do this, I think."</p> <div>

<p>Kojima also popped up on <a href="https://x.com/NetflixJP/status/2001789572586574127">Netflix Japan</a> recently, too, interviewing the Duffer Brothers at what seems to be Kojima Productions' office. In it, the brothers admitted how much Japanese culture impacted them, particularly games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, which "really influenced the whole look of the Upside Down and the other dimension".</p>
<p>They also mentioned Metal Gear Solid, but that may have been because Kojima was the one interviewing them.</p>
<p>"Those [games] were all discussed in the room," they said. "It was filtered through the lens of how we remembered seeing them and playing them for the first time when we were young and filtered through our experience, but they were just as much a part of Stranger Things [as influences from The Big Three, John Carpenter, Spielberg, and Stephen King]."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The best thing I bought this year: The Nintendo Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/845477/nintendo-switch-2-game-system-favorite</link>
            <guid>1389517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> for a long time. Rumors of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">allegedly-real-but-never-released Switch Pro</a> swirled around for years as I watched fewer and fewer AAA third-party games make their way to Nintendo’s little console that could. There were always enough first-party titles and indie games to tide me over, but I watched with some envy as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">games like <em>Elden Ring</em></a> took the world by storm, knowing I’d have to wait until Nintendo’s next generation hardware arrived to add them to my Switch library. Now, finally, it’s here.</p><p>The Switch 2’s core strength for me boils down to it being a better version of the original Switch. Its 7.9-inch 120Hz 1080P screen looks sharp — yes, an OLED display would have been nicer, but I’m not complaining — and its ability to output at up to 4K, or up to 120Hz at lower resolutions, is a welcome improvement. It can play most original Nintendo Switch games, some of which have been updated through free or paid patches to run at a higher frame rate or resolution.</p><p>The only native Switch 2 game I’ve played so far is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which I picked up as part of a bundle with the system. My most-played game is the original Switch title <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which runs at 4K and 60 frames per second if you get the Switch 2 edition for $10 (it’s a free download if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription). That subscription also allows me to play a growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642436/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-f-zero-hands-on">GameCube games available as Nintendo Classics</a>, including titles I didn’t get to play when I was a kid.</p><p>I specifically put off playing games from my backlog, including titles going back several years, until I could play them on a larger display in handheld mode, and I don’t regret my decision. Putting dozens of hours into <em>Octopath Traveler</em> while chilling on the couch with the big-screen handheld was a heck of a lot of fun. Nintendo and third-party developers have also been pretty generous with releasing free demos of Nintendo Switch 2 titles, including <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, so it’s possible to sample bigger titles before deciding to pick them up.</p><p>My only real complaint with the Nintendo Switch 2 is its 256GB of internal storage, which isn’t enough for folks like me who’ve built up a large digital library of Switch games. Adding more requires you to pop in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-AM/dp/B0FT995SPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">microSD Express card</a><strong>, </strong>which can be twice the price of than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSD-MicroSDXC-MB-MD512SA-AM/dp/B0C1PRYPYX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">regular microSD cards</a> used by the original Switch. My hope is that if a hardware revision comes down the line it’ll include an OLED display and at least 512GB of storage. By that time microSD Express cards will have hopefully become more affordable.</p><p>The console’s $449.99 starting price came as a shock to many, but it seems fair given its tech specs, and an escalating tariff situation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">delayed the Switch 2’s preorder timing</a> in North America and compelled Nintendo to raise the price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">original Nintendo Switch</a>. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">recently announced</a> that it “will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.” I’ll continue to look forward to exclusive titles making their way to my new console of choice, along with ports of third-party games that I haven’t gotten around to yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/845477/nintendo-switch-2-game-system-favorite]]></content:encoded>

              <p>As we come barreling toward the end of the year, you can still find all sorts of great tech deals. Lots of good stuff has been marked down for holiday shopping, but there is no rule against using these hefty discounts to secure a nice new gift for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6540/">If you’re been in the marker for a new computer, you can upgrade to the Apple iMac right now while saving yourself 12%.</a> That may not sound like a ton, but it actually cuts the price down by $150. The M4-powered iMac which usually runs for $1,299 is now just $1,149 through the holiday season.</p>
<p>This 2024 Apple iMac all-in-one desktop computer is powered by the M4 chip. This chip is one of Apple’s most powerful yet. The M5 just came out, but this one is still remarkably reliable. It’s built for Apple Intelligence and will keep your system running smoothly whether you are editing photos, building out decks, gaming, or bouncing between a million and one browser tabs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6540/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Display</h2>
<p>With an all-in-on computer, you’re committed to whatever screen its built out of. Good thing this one is sleek as heck. The 24-inch retina monitor displays in a crisp resolution of 4.5K and features 500 nits of brightness. The screen supports up to one billion colors, so you will be looking at a highly detailed screen with a ton of color depth. This is excellent for anyone who works in a visual medium all the time like photographers touching up their photos.</p>

            <p>The Indie Game Awards has withdrawn two awards previously given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, not because of the debate about what does and doesn't constitute an "indie" game, but because a representative of Sandfall Interactive had agreed that no gen AI had been used in the development when, in fact, it had.</p>
<p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," the nomination commitment explained. "When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p>"In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p>

You’ll get some scrolling exposition text setting up the events of the game, and you’ll either be plonked in the middle of a room or a field, ready to save the princess, or wake up after a dream or a shipwreck or something. I’m generalising, but there’s something intimately familiar about <em>how</em> an old-school Zelda game often stands out. It’s cosy, it gets you asking questions, and it's very <em>fantasy</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> doesn’t do all of that. After your obligatory context dump, protagonist Pippit is sitting in the back of a taxi, yapping away at the driver. He’s talking about his family – whom he’s going to visit – and his yoyo skills. And he really loves his yoyo. He’s confident, chatty, but far away from your typical hero with an attitude and a lack of direction.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067txihkn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Playing through Pipistrello over the summer, I was completely enchanted by its chunky spritework and its sprawling metropolis map. The vibes are the complete opposite of a Zelda game. Except that’s almost exactly what Pipistrello is – a top-down GBA-inspired Zelda with an injection of energy, colour, and attitude. It’s got sass for days and an extremely fun mesh of platforming, combat, and exploration, all driven by a simple walk of the dog… and a bunch of other tricks.</p>
<figure data-uuid="38f3897dadca0"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38f3897dadca0/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>No sooner than Pippit’s auntie Madame, head of Pipistrello Industries, is attacked by four frustrated industry owners, is the young bat forced to confront the issues his family’s business has caused. Oh, and because of the battery-power spell used on Madame, his yoyo is now possessed by his auntie, and she frequently likes to speak to him. Yes, this is absolutely a love letter to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a>.</p>
<p>Pippit and Madame’s banter makes the game for me in the same way that I loved Ezlo’s snarky nature in Capcom’s GBA Zelda game. And while Link doesn’t talk, I remember thinking of ways to backchat Ezlo multiple times. With Pipistrello, Pippit is already doing that – and sometimes it’s earned, because while Madame may love her nephew, she’s not exactly supportive of his love of the yoyo.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2b3a2a0142b77"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b3a2a0142b77/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because Pippit speaks, it immediately gives the game a different kind of energy. Think about the pacing and the world of a top-down Zelda: it’s usually steady, lush and green, and each map is the kind of place you can steadily make your way around, chopping down octoroks, chuchus or patches of grass. Pipistrello might look cute and cuddly, but that electric colour palette only helps bolster the more kinetic movement of the little bat and his yoyo, now enhanced with battery-powered magic and a grumpy aunt.</p>
<p>Every new attack or skill is based on a real-world yoyo trick, and their uses logically make sense. Round the World, for instance, sees Pippit spin the yoyo around his head, pushing enemies away. He also has a charged attack that will keep the yoyo in-place to do multiple hits of damage. And there are plenty of angled corners everywhere, which Pippit can use to bounce his yoyo off of to grab items from afar or attack enemies on the other side.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0bf5654775a73"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bf5654775a73/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Upgrades don’t come in the form of new weapons or upgrades, or even new outfits. Instead, you have to earn them by paying off a debt to your cousin Pepita. Again, something that totally makes sense in an urban environment and within a family that’s fuelled by greed and money. The debt stays with you and half the money you collect goes towards paying it off, but you’re also lumbered with a debuff or two until you pay it off. You might have one heart fewer or be a little slower for a while. Picking the upgrade you want at the right time is crucial, because no one wants to go into a boss fight with lower defenses.</p>
<p>But I think the traversal is where the game really shines, and the creativity of each trick is so fun to play around with. Walk the Dog is now a kind of auto-run, which pulls Pippit along water and bounces off of angled corners. The UFO allows Pippit to suspend the yoyo in mmid-air off-string, so he can hook onto it and jump over large gaps. Every single skill is hugely important, because each one will lead to a different secret, a Petal Container (a very subtle nod to a Heart Piece), a Badge (think Paper Mario), or a hidden room.</p>
<p>It’s just like blowing up a wall with a bomb, but Pipistrello does it with its own flair, and a dash of Metroidvania connectivity and backtracking. But with how densely packed each screen is – whether it be dissatisfied citizens or people queuing up to gorge on fast food, enemies hopping around, holes in the ground, traffic, etc. – this large city feels lived-in. This isn’t a forest and a beach and a jungle all linked together; it’s a metropolis crumbling under the weight of corporate competition.</p>

<p>The city itself is a character as a result – split into four distinct districts, with Pipistrello Manor at the far north, each one is home to one of the four business owners who attacked Madame. There’s also an entire underground sewer map (the depths? Say it ain’t so!) which is just another delightful collection of movement puzzles and secrets.</p>
<p>Old Rattalia Town is home to the Roquefort Shopping Center and is a hub of commerce, food, and trouble, while the Fadalins Neighborhood is home to a much greener area, and where the FadaFest Convention takes place. And each district has its own dungeon. C’mon, you didn’t expect <em>dungeons</em> in a Zelda-inspired game? And all of them are brilliant.</p>
<p>The PoultryFC Stadium might be my favourite, a football stadium which culminates in a match against Cuca Carrara’s (one of those aforementioned business leaders) team, which the boss has been using to fix matches and steal money from eager gamblers. Toxy runs a never-ending convention that scams attendees with crypto-like schemes, and to end it, you have to fight a cosplayer called Linkoln. Yeah...</p>
<figure data-uuid="3f54d17a92b52"><a title="Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f54d17a92b52/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PM Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each of these mazes is an interconnected playground of puzzles, enemy gauntlets, items, and more. And the puzzles in Pipistrello aren’t easy; logical, but tricky. Think of scenarios where you have to Wall-Ride, jump, bounce off the wall, hook onto a UFO, and then Wall-Ride again. Every movement skill often comes into play in succession, particularly in some of the optional challenges. But when you get the item at the end, it feels so good.</p>
<p>Pipistrello may wear its influences proudly on its sleeve, but it’s all the better for it in my eyes. It gives the ever-popular top-down Zelda formula a shot of spiritedness, a dash of brashness, and a pop of colour. This isn’t a game about saving one person or saving the world from a great evil – the evil here is capitalism, people trying to make a profit to benefit their own industry. And Pippit recognises that the four industry bosses are part of the problem, but the ultimate problem is caused by his aunt.</p>

<p>There’s no empathy for Link’s foes in Zelda, because those games are a tale of good versus evil. But in Pipistrello, Pippit is empathetic to his enemy’s concerns; his aunt <em>has</em> been hogging all the power and putting pressure on other businesses. This moral core is only possible <em>because</em> of the setting and gameplay – this is a classic Zelda for the modern day, addressing concerns that we all have. Not a fantasy, but an Around the World reality.</p>
<p>If you felt let down by last year’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, or you’re really craving some pixel art Zelda-style gameplay with a touch of Metroidvania (and I know there’s been a bunch of those this year), please don’t sleep on Pipistrello. It’s a masterclass in level design that deserves to be celebrated.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2-pack-govee-smart-light-bulbs-offers-16-million-colors-priced-like-basic-bulb-on-amazon-2000655036</link>
            <guid>1389496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one thing that can transform how your home feels without dropping hundreds on new furniture, it’s the lighting you choose. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">Govee smart bulbs now cost just $17 for a two-pack on Amazon, down from the usual $25, and you can stack an extra 10% off with the promo code IZVCRPT14KV7</a> to hit a record low price that makes upgrading your entire house ridiculously affordable.</p>
<p>You get <strong>1000 lumens of brightness per bulb</strong> (equivalent to old 75W incandescents), <strong>access to 16 million colors</strong>, <strong>tunable white light</strong> from warm 2700K to cool 6500K, <strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity</strong>, and full <strong>voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant</strong>. These bulbs create different atmospheres for different moods without you touching a dimmer switch. Order today and Amazon delivers them before Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000 Lumens Really Lights Up Big Rooms</h2>
<p>That 1000-lumen output is a lot more important than it sounds like it would be: Cheap smart bulbs usually only go up to 600–800 lumens which means that even at full brightness, they don’t light up big rooms very well. You can make them brighter when you need task lighting or dim them down across the full 1–100% range for ambiance. The CRI90+ color rendering index makes colors look real and true instead of washed out like they do under cheap LEDs.</p>



<p>You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors</strong> so you can get the exact shade you want instead of going through a few presets that never quite match what you had in mind. You can make your living room glow purple while your kitchen stays warm white, or you can set all the bulbs to the same energizing blue-white for morning routines. The <strong>tunable white range goes from 2700K to 6500K</strong> which is the range of colors that goes from the warmth of candlelight to the brightness of office daylight.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee Home app gives you access to 54 scene modes</strong> that handle the color programming for you if you don’t want to manually adjust settings. <strong>Music sync mode makes the bulbs change colors </strong>when your phone’s microphone picks up sound, turning any playlist into a light show that pulses with the beat. Sunrise and sunset timers gradually brighten or dim the lights to wake you naturally or ease you into evening, and you can schedule these automations to match your actual daily routine instead of fumbling for switches half-asleep.</p>
<p>You can control these bulbs from anywhere using the app, even when you’re not home, which lets you turn the lights on before you get there or check to see if you left something on after you left. You can change the brightness, colors, or turn lights on and off with your voice using Alexa or Google Assistant. This feels like the future at first, but then it quickly becomes the only way you want to interact with lights. The dual connectivity also acts as a backup;<strong> if your Wi-Fi goes down, you can still use Bluetooth to control things locally</strong>.</p>
<p>The bulbs fit in <strong>standard A19 sockets</strong> and work with any lamp or fixture that takes regular screw-in bulbs and makes installation as easy as changing old bulbs. Most routers send out 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals, which these devices can connect to. These 9-watt bulbs use a lot less electricity than old 75-watt incandescent bulbs, but they still give off the same amount of light.</p>
<p>The $17 price for two bulbs becomes even better when you apply that 10% promo code, and brings your <strong>effective cost down to around $7.65 per bulb.</strong> That’s cheaper than many dumb LED bulbs that just turn on and off, except these give you millions of colors, remote control, voice commands, scheduling, and music sync capabilities.</p>

			<p>DICE's <strong>Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> launch in November 2017 was notoriously hindered by the loot box scandal. The game's original monetization scheme provided in-game advantages to those who chose to spend real money to expedite unlocks. The developers increased the rate at which players could work toward unlocks simply by playing the game. However, shortly before the release date, a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/it_takes_40_hours_to_unlock_a_hero_spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calculated</a> that it would still take around 40 hours of gameplay to unlock a hero. </p>



<p>This prompted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/comment/dppv3bo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer response from the EA Community Team</a> that included the infamous <strong>'sense of pride and accomplishment'</strong> comment, which riled up fans so badly that it went down (as certified in 2019 by the Guinness World Records) as <strong>the most downvoted comment in Reddit's history</strong> with over 683K downvotes. Belgian authorities even started an investigation, while as of November 16, 2017, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claim-star-wars-battlefront-ii-not-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was still maintaining</a> that the loot box model did not constitute gambling. The following day (which was also the release day), though, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove all microtransactions from the game</a>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, all this controversy greatly harmed the reputation of Star Wars Battlefront II in the eyes of many gamers. It's a shame, because the game itself was very enjoyable, and over time, it garnered quite a dedicated following. DICE improved it with various content updates, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-on-scarif-update-date-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in late April 2020</a>. Still, the community wanted more, and that's how the <a href="https://kyber.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER project</a> began.</p>



<p><strong>KYBER</strong> is a custom server platform and mod launcher that completely replaces Star Wars Battlefront II's official online infrastructure on PC and introduces various additions, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated 24/7 community-operated servers</strong> that allow players to host persistent game sessions with custom rulesets, map selections, and gameplay modifications.</li>



<li><strong>Full support for community-made mods</strong>, enabling creators to develop new gameplay mechanics, cosmetics, balance changes, and content entirely separate from official patches.</li>



<li><strong>Key mode changes,</strong> such as Supremacy being developed into the Battlefield-inspired Conquest mode, where matches are faster paced and have a clearer flow.  </li>



<li><strong>A fully functional server browser</strong>, which was missing in the official game.</li>



<li><strong>Proximity-based voice chat</strong>, where players hear teammates and nearby opponents based on in-game distance rather than team-only channels, encouraging organic squad coordination without requiring external platforms like Discord.</li>



<li><strong>Detailed stats tracking</strong> that allows players to review their career statistics across both official online servers and KYBER servers.</li>



<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> that leverages the game's built-in spectator camera. Useful to monitor suspicious players, view epic battles, and more.</li>
</ul>

<iframe title="KYBER is NOW OFFICIALLY PUBLIC | Galactic Assault | Star Wars Battlefront 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KawoPSZ89ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but after four years of work, KYBER launched a few hours ago in Open Beta to expand the player base and help refine the last bugs ahead of the full release. You can now install KYBER following this procedure:</p>



<h2 id="h-prerequisites-preliminary-setup">Prerequisites (Preliminary Setup)</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Own a legal PC copy of Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> (via EA App, Steam, Epic Games, or EA Play subscription)</li>



<li><strong>Disable the Discord overlay</strong> for Battlefront II</li>



<li><strong>Disable FrostyFix</strong> (it conflicts with KYBER)</li>



<li><strong>Launch vanilla Battlefront II once</strong> after installation to initialize the game</li>



<li><strong>Register a free NexusMods account</strong> or log in with your existing one on the NexusMods website.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-installation-steps">Installation Steps</h2>



<p><strong>Steps 1-2: Downloading and Running the Installer</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/kyber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER Discord server</a></li>



<li>Navigate to <code>#download</code> channel and click "here" to download the installer</li>



<li>If the browser blocks the download, select "more info" then "download anyway"</li>



<li>Extract the downloaded <code>.zip</code> file</li>



<li>Double-click the installer <code>.exe</code> file</li>



<li>Click "Yes" when prompted to allow KYBER to modify your computer</li>



<li>Click "Next" through the installation wizard until "Finish"</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Step 3: Antivirus Whitelisting</strong><br>Windows Security and third-party antivirus software must exclude KYBER directories to prevent false-positive threats:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KYBER Launcher</code></li>



<li><code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\ArmchairDevelopers</code></li>
</ul>



<p>Access exclusions via: Windows Settings → Update &amp; Security → Windows Security → Virus &amp; Threat Protection → Manage Settings → Add or Remove Exclusions</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: EA Account Authentication</strong><br>Log in to KYBER using your <strong>EA account</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: Maxima Launcher Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Click "Open Maxima Launcher" when prompted</li>



<li>The EA App will automatically shift to <strong>Offline mode</strong> (this is intentional)</li>



<li>The EA App must remain offline or closed while playing KYBER</li>



<li>If Windows Defender prompts for network access, click "Allow"</li>



<li>To later play on the official EA servers: close KYBER, set EA App to Online, and launch normally</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 6: NexusMods Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Log in to NexusMods inside KYBER (do not create a new account inside KYBER)</li>



<li>In the NexusMods pop-up window, scroll down and click "Allow" to authorize</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 7: Joining a Server</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Go to the "Home" section to open the server browser</li>



<li>Select a server and click "Download Mods"</li>



<li>Once downloads complete, click "Play" to join</li>



<li>Mods download only once per server</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 8: Managing Mod Downloads</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mods with fewer than 150 NexusMods downloads require manual search in the "Mods" tab</li>



<li><strong>Popular mods download faster</strong> (Battlefront Plus V10 Beta101 and Battlefront Expanded V7.1 host files directly on KYBER servers, bypassing NexusMods throttling)</li>



<li>Users can also download mod <code>.zip</code> files from the NexusMods website and drag-and-drop into the KYBER window for installation</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 9: Proximity Chat Configuration</strong><br>After launching Star Wars Battlefront II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Press "Insert" or Alt-Tab to KYBER</li>



<li>Go to "Settings" → "In-Game Settings"</li>



<li>Configure proximity chat:
<ul>
<li>Enable/disable voice</li>



<li>Adjust volume</li>



<li>Choose push-to-talk or always-on mode</li>



<li>Select audio input/output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The KYBER team had also promised to release the source code, but they asked for a little more time to make it 'more presentable'. As such, the current plan is to make it public next month (January 2026).</p>



<p>While a few members of the original development team at DICE <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are interested in making Star Wars Battlefront III</a>, it may be a long time before Lucasfilm actually gives the green light to such a project. Thankfully, the PC community at least will be served by the continued development and improvement of KYBER.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m5-with-max-config-drops-record-low-amazon-drops-margin-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000655017</link>
            <guid>1389472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with these M5 MacBook Pro models a few weeks ago and they’re still full price on Apple’s website, but <strong>Amazon decided to spread some holiday cheer by lowering the prices on all models to all-time lows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">24GB/1TB model now costs $1,799 instead of $1,999</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">the 16GB/512GB model now costs $1,349 instead of $1,599</a>. This means that these M5 machines are actually cheaper than the M4 generation was when it first came out. You get here Apple’s new M5 chip, a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid display that can reach 1600 nits of brightness and a battery lasts all day. The<strong> 24GB model will be shipped before Christmas</strong>, and the 16GB model will be sent by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful M5 Chip</h2>
<p>The M5 processor doesn’t just make the M4 better but it also changes the way a laptop handles heavy workloads. Each GPU core now has a Neural Accelerator that speeds up AI tasks by a lot which means you can handle machine learning workloads and Apple Intelligence features at speeds that would have needed a desktop workstation just a few years ago. The 10-core CPU can easily handle everything from video editing to compiling software and the unified memory architecture means that your RAM talks directly to the processor, so there are no bottlenecks like those that happen with regular laptop designs.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence runs completely on your device so your private information never leaves your MacBook to be processed on a cloud server. The system helps you write better, make your ideas clearer, and do repetitive tasks automatically without sending your data to Apple or anyone else. This <strong>privacy-first approach is much more important than most people think </strong>and it lets you use AI features without worrying that your emails, documents, or creative work will end up in a training dataset.</p>



<p>The <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a peak brightness of 1600 nits</strong> for HDR content and a steady brightness of 1000 nits for regular use. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio makes blacks look really black instead of that grayish tone you see on cheaper laptop screens. The colors are also very accurate, making this a good choice for professional photo and video work.</p>
<p>The promise of a battery life that lasts all day isn’t just a marketing gimmick: This laptop works the same whether it’s plugged in or running on battery power. Most Windows laptops slow down when you unplug them to save power, but the M5’s efficiency lets you render video, compile code, or run resource-intensive creative apps at full speed for hours without needing to find an outlet. You can really take this to a coffee shop and work all day without bringing the charger.</p>



<p>The ability to <strong>work with other Apple devices makes the whole ecosystem better</strong> than any one product could do on its own: You can control your iPhone from your Mac’s screen with iPhone Mirroring which means you can reply to texts or use apps that only work on iPhones without having to pick up your phone. You can copy something on your iPhone and paste it straight into a document on your Mac. You can also start a FaceTime call on your laptop and then switch to your phone when you need to move around.</p>
<p>The 24GB/1TB model costs $1,799, and the 16GB/512GB model costs $1,349 and that’s<strong> less than what the M4 generation cost when it first came out</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Needed a Decade to ‘Feel Comfortable’ with Creating ‘New Stuff’ in Fallout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/</link>
            <guid>1389469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is one of the most recognizable post-apocalyptic franchises in modern gaming. It has become a multimedia gem in recent years with the emergence of the live-series television show, and it boasts a lengthy lineup of titles that span almost a thirty-year history. </p>



<p>In 2004, Bethesda Game Studios acquired a license to develop Fallout 3, before purchasing the franchise outright in 2007. In the words of one of the most notable developers in the Fallout space, it wouldn’t be until Fallout 4 was developed and released almost a decade later that the team felt ‘comfortable’ with the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-comfortable-with-creation-in-fallout">Getting Comfortable with Creation in Fallout</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Emil Pagliarulo, one of the Bethesda veterans who has driven the production of Fallout forward over the years, dropped a tasty titbit. He suggested that it took <strong>a long time </strong>for Bethesda to get comfortable with this legendary series, especially following the pivot that saw Fallout 3 become a transformative first-person RPG.</p>



<p>He suggested that buying the brand wasn’t enough for the company to feel as flexible and inventive as they might have wanted. In Fallout 3, it was all about paying tribute to what had come before, and it wasn’t until 2015’s Fallout 4 that the team felt more creative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big thing about Fallout 3 was it’s this transitional game. It was the first Fallout we had done. So we wanted to make sure we were really honoring the legacy of the franchise and those earlier games.</p>



<p>We owned it, but owning a franchise and an IP is different than feeling like you own it creatively.</p>



<p>I think by the time Fallout 4 came around we felt more comfortable with like okay, ‘we don’t have to be so reverential now, it’s not all nostalgia, we can create some new stuff.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/bethesda-was-scared-of-making-fallout-3-but-by-fallout-4-it-had-chilled-out-we-dont-have-to-be-so-reverential-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> </em>for the interview quote.</p>



<p>Perhaps Emil is forgetting the creation of Fallout Shelter, which was released just before Fallout 4 and was a pretty innovative and transformative game in itself.</p>



<p>Fallout 3 is seen as being one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a treasure trove of a title that was expanded with stellar drops for months after the game launched, and even today, it remains a fan favorite title. Fallout 4, which is by numbers a better seller than Fallout 3, wasn’t received quite as well.</p>



<p>And in the middle of that, you have Fallout: New Vegas, seen by many as the best Fallout game ever made, which Bethesda <strong>published </strong>rather than developed outright. That accolade goes to Obsidian.</p>



<p>The wider community has mixed feelings about Bethesda’s ‘treatment’ of Fallout over the years. It’s expected that the next major release in the series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">Fallout 5</a>, won’t surface for many years, and for now, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter are the only games in the series receiving substantial updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Quietly Ends Production of the Most Affordable Steam Deck]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-ends-production-affordable-steam-deck-lcd/</link>
            <guid>1389466</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has undertaken a shake-up of sorts in the handheld gaming world, nixing production of the most affordable Steam Deck, the LCD ‘OG’ model. It was recently discovered by eagle-eyed gamers that Valve had silently posted a note on the <span>Steam Deck store page, referenc<strong>ing the end of production</strong>, with what was left representing the final stock of&nbsp;</span>the LCD model.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, we were able to add the 256GB LCD model to our basket, but who knows how many are left to purchase in Valve’s supply lines?</p>







<h2 id="h-oled-or-bust">OLED or Bust</h2>



<p>If you want a Steam Deck going forward, you’ll soon need to rely exclusively on the OLED model, which has an entry pricing point of $549 for the 512GB variant. That’s a fair reach over the 256GB LCD model, which boasts a price tag of $399 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Of course, the OLED model is an improvement in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has a bigger, better screen, better networking capabilities, a larger battery, and a *<em>checks notes</em>* longer charging cable, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Valve is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but many expected a cut-price deal to get rid of them, particularly amidst the ongoing Steam Winter Sale and the approach to the festive window. If stock is there to be cleared, then host a clearance sale!</p>



<p>Last year, when discontinuation plans started surfacing, Valve knocked 15% off the price before phasing out the 64GB LCD Steam Deck.</p>



<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s storefront</a> and try to shop for a Steam Deck, you’ll see the small print:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Valve is moving on to bigger and brighter things, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/">recently revealed Steam Machine</a>, a hybrid device that’s supposed to be the perfect combination of a gaming PC and a traditional home console.</p>



<p>It’s slated for a 2026 release, but nobody has the pricing structure for the thing on lock just yet.</p>







<p>Are you hoping that the Steam Deck LCD model gets a price slash so you can scoop one without breaking the bank? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1389454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="0b41a0381cbf6"><a title="Ice Climber - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b41a0381cbf6/ice-climber-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ho, ho, ho, everyone! Welcome to a particularly festive edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-mega-man-6">Last week</a> saw two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man_6">Mega Man 6</a> going head-to-head, and it was a little closer than we expected. The yellow Japanese variant (this writer's favourite) just clinched it, however, taking 54% of the vote and leaving the North American design with the remaining 46%.</p>
<p>This time, as we get ever closer to Christmas Day, we're taking things in a festive and frosty direction, as we match up a trio of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>. Mainly remembered today for its frustrating controls, relationship-breaking potential and <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> fighters, this NES launch title (in North America) remains a cleverly-designed classic, and it's a beauty when it comes to box art!</p>
<p>There are three covers to choose between this week, so get your coat, gloves, and scarf on, and let's go out to meet 'em.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:30823 @ 1766334909 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0098cc938c330"><a title="Ice Climber - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0098cc938c330/ice-climber-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, these North American NES covers really are classics, eh? This one in particular is so dynamic. The leaping sprite, the stretched back hammer swing, the 'will they make it?' platform <em>just</em> out of reach, and the ice-cool polar bear all add up to a pretty iconic image. Don't even get us started on those little snowflakes falling down the black backdrop!</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7d70ae1168584"><a title="Ice Climber - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d70ae1168584/ice-climber-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design opts for something a little different. This cute, cartoon image sees a titular climber leaping up through the ice and giving a nearby polar bear and seal a nasty surprise (not enough for the former to remove its sunglasses, though). It's framed by the same black background that most European NES covers were, but still, it's a neat design.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>

<p>The Japanese cover uses the same design as the European counterpart, but its horizontal box means that it fills the space far better. The grey backdrop is nothing to write home about, but we still enjoy looking at that poor, shocked bear.</p>

                <p>One of the coolest Lego models themed around space exploration and technology is on sale for a new all-time low price.

This set was $154 during Amazon's Black Friday sale, so if you missed that deal, you can take advantage of an even better offer. The 1,913-piece model is only on sale for this price until December 21 at 11:59 PM PT.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Lego is discontinuing the Lunar Roving Vehicle, so this very well could be your last chance to buy it from a retail store.

Astronauts haven't set foot on the Moon since, so this replica commemorates an important piece of space exploration history.</p><p>When fully assembled, Lego's replica of the Lunar Roving Vehicle measures 15 x 10 x 5.5 inches.</p><p>The bulk of the 1,913 pieces are used to build the large LRV, but this set also has a few modular components that can be detached and displayed separately. One cool aspect with the modular builds is that Lego included display plaques with information cards for the vehicle as well as the three detachable models: Forward Chassis, Lunar Communications Relay Unit (LCRU), and Aft Pallet Assembly.</p><p>The Forward Chassis includes the gyro and odometer navigation unit and the brush that cleaned Moon dust from the vehicle. The LCRU model has the TV camera, communications antenna, and the LRV's battery pack. The Aft Pallet Assembly was used for experiments and features tools such as a drill and shovel, the Traverse Gravimeter, and a rock known as Big Muley, which was actually found on the Apollo 16 mission. The Traverse Gravimeter was used to conduct an experiment on the Moon's composition beneath the surface.</p><p>The LRV has authentic steering, suspension, and wheels. You can display the vehicle upright on its wheels, but it can also be placed upside down by rotating the wheel axles, lowering the seat backrests, and folding the front and back portions. You can see LRV upside down alongside the three modules below.</p><p>Technic vehicle models have place a far greater emphasis on mechanical components than standard Lego sets. You'll find a far larger quantity of non-traditional Lego pieces like pins and beams in these builds. This particular model is recommended for adults or experienced Lego Technic builders.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886" data-ratio="0.40909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886"></a><figcaption>Lego Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (42182)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png"></figure><p>Another Lego Technic space-themed model deal to check out is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Building-Birthday-Imaginative-Independent/dp/B0CGY3ZB29?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">526-piece Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit</a> for $65 (was $75).

<p>But Aspyr "can't announce anything at the moment"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="563f12a46789a"><a title="Tomb Raider: Rise of the Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/563f12a46789a/tomb-raider-rise-of-the-tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Crystal Dynamics</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the many shadow drops recently was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Aspyr teamed up with Crystal Dynamics to make it happen, and if you're wondering if we'll see the other two entries in the "Survivor" trilogy (that's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>), we've now got an official comment.</p>
<p>According to Aspyr's product manager Jordon Reese, the "passionate response" from Nintendo fans has apparently given the team "strong encouragement" to consider more. Here's the full exchange about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-updates-planned-for-switch-platforms">the same interview</a> with Nintendo Everything recently:</p><div><figure data-videoid="BvMG4aVuxgs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytBvMG4aVuxgs" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6dee37rxnvph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>This game kicked off the Tomb Raider “Survivor” trilogy, so we need to ask the obvious question – is Aspyr interested in bringing over Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider to Nintendo platforms as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aspyr:</strong> "We have definitely seen this question! We’ve successfully brought back the classic era (I-VI) and now the ‘origin story’ of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms. We can’t announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, there's nothing to announce "at the moment", but this response has supposedly given the developer a chance to continue exploring these possibilities. As mentioned, it's also got a bit of a history now, having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider I-VI</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Aspyr's more immediate focus is to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-updates-planned-for-switch-platforms">release some improvements</a> for Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on the Switch and Switch 2, with Reese adding how the developer wants to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>The same interview also confirmed Aspyr was "committed" to supporting the Switch 2 going forward – with this platform its primary target on the Nintendo front for future cross-platform releases. And as for the chance of existing Aspyr Switch games getting Switch 2 updates, there's "nothing to announce" right now, but nothing is necessarily "off the table these days".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell fans everywhere have been chomping at the bit for a new game in the series, but Ubisoft has left the franchise to stagnate for more than a decade. It’s getting to a point of desperation for some, especially with talk of the ‘Splinter Cell Remake’ floating around <strong>all the time</strong> with almost nothing concrete to back it up.</p>



<p>However, a recent announcement revealed that Sam Fisher is (kind of) back in an all-new way, emerging in the popular VR extraction shooter, Ghosts of Tabor.</p>







<h2 id="h-ghosts-of-tabor-x-splinter-cell-crossover">Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell Crossover</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted to experience the role of Sam Fisher from a VR-based perspective, now is your chance. In a new trailer uploaded by the Combat Waffle team, it was revealed that an official partnership with Ubisoft has brought Fisher’s iconic garb to the VR shooter.</p>



<p>The ‘Splinter Cell DLC’ allows players to <strong>become </strong>Sam Fisher, but elements like the gruff tones of Michael Ironside will be up to them to emulate.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s coming in the Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<ul>
<li>Karambit Melee Weapon</li>



<li>FN 57 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>MP7 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>Third Echelon NVGs</li>



<li>Third Echelon Tactical Kevlar Vest</li>



<li>Third Echelon Suit</li>
</ul>



<p>Why wait for a new game containing Sam Fisher to surface when you can dress up as him and go on a merry LARP in Ghosts of Tabor, which we once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-tarkov-vr/">dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the Splinter Cell DLC:</p>

<p>Ghosts of Tabor is available on Meta Quest, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957780/Ghosts_of_Tabor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC VR</a>, and PlayStation VR, and it’s widely considered one of the best shooters to occupy the VR ecosystem. It has been around for a couple of years, and the folks at Combat Waffle are constantly updating the title with fresh content and tweaks.</p>

In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front.</p><p>The cabinet is roughly 61.5 inches tall, just under 19 inches wide, and weighs approximately 62 pounds.

Outside of Arcade1Up cabinets, NBA Jam has been dormant for nearly 15 years; the last home console entry, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. </p></div>                      </div><hr><p>NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.</p><p>NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game.</p><h2>Arcade1Up 2025 Holiday Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626869" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626869"></a><figcaption>Arcade1Up Home Arcade Cabinets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-Furious-5-Foot-Tall-Stand-up-Cabinet/dp/B0CHWWLPML?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: Fast &amp; the Furious (2 Games)</a> -- $500 (<del>$600</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-MAN-5-foot-tall-full-size-stand-up-linux/dp/B0BYQNPTCF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: Pac-Man (14 Games)</a> -- $450 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-2-Player-Control-Machine-Cabinet-Classic/dp/B0D7JG6FFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: NBA Jam (3 Games)</a> -- $400 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8L7BDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Mortal Kombat II (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8H6QDQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Pac-Man (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8KVTZB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Ms. Pac-Man (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-GEN-R-406000-Arcade1Up-Classic-Riser/dp/B0FM8LCZWS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet Riser</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-Ms-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Countercade: Ms. Pac-Man / Galaga (3 Games)</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Countercade-Classic-Portable-Table-top/dp/B0DJGHWD1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Countercade: Pac-Man (3 Games)</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Full-Size-Claw-Machine-Customizable-Entertainment/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full-Size Claw Machine (12 Capsules)</a> -- $500 (<del>$550</del>)</li></ul><p>Two other Arcade1Up Deluxe Cabinets are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NBA+Jam+Deluxe+Arcade+Cabinet+On+Sale+For+Lowest+Price+Ever+At+Amazon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-21+00%3A43%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-21+00%3A43%3A50&amp;fnarticle_id=6537125&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2F6yvQLQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnba-jam-arcade1up-deluxe-home-arcade-cabinet-best-deal%2F1100-6537125%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

<p>Use these Roblox Farm A Fish monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Bait, Coins and much more.</p>



<p>Farm A Fish puts you in charge of your own underwater empire on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. Unlike typical fishing games where you simply catch and sell, this aquatic tycoon challenges you to build a thriving fish farming business from scratch. Starting with just a small pond and basic equipment, you’ll expand your operation by cultivating different fish species, each with their own requirements and profit margins. The goal is to build up your ponds, gather better gear and pets, and scale your fishing business to become the most successful fisher in the game.</p>







<p>Progression in Farm A Fish revolves around the game’s primary currency, Coins, which you earn from your fish ponds and spend on new pond expansions, worker upgrades, and special items. The value of your harvests depends on several factors including fish rarity (common to mythic), fish weight (heavier specimens fetch higher prices), and special mutations that can significantly increase a fish’s worth. Although Coins can be earned through regular gameplay by selling your catches and completing quests from NPCs, the fastest way to accelerate your progress is by redeeming promo codes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-farm-a-fish-codes">Active Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>XMAS: 1x Christmas Bait</li>



<li>EARLY: 5x Food Scoop and 500x Coins</li>



<li>Wilco: 1x Wilco Cat and 1x Wilco Pond Skin</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-farm-a-fish-codes">Expired Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired Farm A Fish Codes at the time of writing. All the released codes are still active and thus players will need to redeem them quickly before they expire.</p>

<p>Farm A Fish codes can typically be found through several official channels maintained by the game’s developer, Tetra Games. The most reliable source is the official Farm A Fish Discord server, where developers post new codes in the dedicated #game-updates channel whenever they release major updates or celebrate special events. This community hub is where you’ll often find codes first, sometimes even before they’re announced elsewhere.</p>







<p>Another great place to check is the official Tetra Games Roblox Group page, where the development team regularly shares news about the game, including promotional codes during milestones like reaching certain player counts or celebrating holidays. However, keeping track of all these sources can be time-consuming, especially since Farm A Fish codes don’t come with notifications when they expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Farm A Fish codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Endzone Strike monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including draws, ball skins and much more.</p>



<p>Endzone Strike fuses high-energy anime action with American football in a unique <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-pet-capture-adventure-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that’s taking the platform by storm. This isn’t your standard sports simulator – it’s a high-octane battle of special moves, character collection, and strategic team building. Players start with basic characters and limited abilities, then work their way up to fielding a squad of powerhouse athletes with flashy special attacks. Each match earns you Strike Points that serve as the game’s main currency. </p>







<p>These points are your ticket to recruiting new players through the gacha-style summoning system, upgrading existing team members, and purchasing equipment that boosts performance. While grinding matches steadily builds your team, the developers regularly release redemption codes on social media and Discord events that grant instant Strike Points, exclusive character skins, or limited-time power-ups.</p>

This includes the No Skill Games Discord group, where the team often shares codes during game updates, milestones, and special events.

<p>The Switch 2 has now been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-six-months-since-launch-how-would-you-rate-switch-2">available for six months</a>, and during this time, there have been multiple Switch game compatibility updates.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've now got another batch of titles that are now fully functioning on Nintendo's new hybrid system. The highlight of the lot is the Aspyr release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_republic_commando">Star Wars: Republic Commando</a>, with the official Nintendo <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100fa10115f8000">compatibility search page</a> also reflecting this update.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>More Kairosoft titles have also been updated this week and are now "supported" on the Switch 2.

<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove</a> tied to audio problems in some parts of the game.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, Warner Bros. released an update earlier this week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> featuring performance, visual and stability improvements when playing the game through backwards compatibility on the Switch 2.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordprotect-online-identity-service-covers-up-to-10k-in-scam-losses-now-going-for-peanuts-2000655012</link>
            <guid>1389271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last shopping rush before Christmas is a great time for cybercriminals because there are so many online transactions, quick purchases, and distracted shoppers. NordProtect’s decision to lower the price of its <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">identity protection service to a record low of $4.49 per month, down from its usual $14.99 rate</a>, is especially important this time of year, when prices are usually lower.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another holiday sale on electronics or entertainment subscriptions that people don’t care about: Identity theft protection deals with a basic security issue that gets worse around the holidays, when fake transactions blend in more easily with real spending patterns and stolen credentials are more actively traded on criminal networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>Think about how bad identity theft is in the United States right now. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost $12.5 billion to fraud last year alone. This is a 25% increase from the year before. In 2024, the agency handled more than 1.1 million identity theft complaints. This means that a new victim came forward every 22 seconds throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Identity Theft by the Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every 22 seconds:</strong> A new identity theft case occurs in the United States</li>
<li><strong>1.1 million:</strong><span> Identity theft complaints filed with the FTC in 2024</span></li>
<li><strong>$12.5 billion:</strong><span> Total consumer losses to fraud in the past year</span></li>
<li><strong>44%:</strong><span>&nbsp;Percentage of identity theft cases involving credit card fraud</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These risks are even higher during the holidays: More people shopping online means more chances for data theft, and when there are a lot of legitimate transactions, it’s harder to spot fake charges right away. Phishing attempts that look like shipping notifications or seasonal sales alerts are on the rise, and retailers and payment processors are at greater risk of breaches because their infrastructure is under stress and they have to hire temporary workers.</p>
<h2>How Protection Really Works</h2>
<p>Instead of checking identities by hand every so often, NordProtect uses continuous automated surveillance. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">read Gizmodo’s review here to learn more about it</a>. <strong>NordProtect checks credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, looks for personal information on dark web marketplaces, and keeps an eye on linked financial accounts for strange activity.</p>
<p>The part that watches the dark web is especially important: There are parts of the internet (dark web) where stolen Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and full identity packages are traded. When your information shows up in these places, it usually means that there has been a security breach in one of the services you use. Early detection is important because it gives you time to lock down accounts before criminals can use the information.</p>
<p><strong>TransUnion’s credit monitoring service</strong> can catch things like new loan applications, account openings, or changes to your credit limit that you didn’t authorize. The system marks these events right away instead of waiting for monthly reviews of credit reports. When you monitor your bank account, you can spot strange withdrawal patterns, suspicious transfer requests, or debit card use that isn’t safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>The value proposition goes beyond just alerts: NordProtect gives you specific instructions on what to do when it finds a problem. If your email is part of a data breach, you will be told which accounts need new passwords, which security questions need to be changed, and whether or not two-factor authentication should be turned on. The service explains how to dispute charges that are not real and how to freeze your credit if they do.</p>
<h2>Financial Protection That Goes Beyond Monitoring</h2>
<p>Most people don’t realize how much it costs to recover from identity theft until they have to deal with it directly. For example, hiring a lawyer to fight fraudulent accounts can cost hundreds of dollars per hour. If you have to take time off work to deal with banks, creditors, and credit bureaus, you will lose money. And the costs of traveling to meet with law enforcement or financial institutions in person add up.</p>
<p><strong>NordProtect covers up to $1 million in identity theft recovery costs</strong>, including legal fees, lost wages, and documented costs related to restoring your identity and credit score.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Extra parts of insurance cover certain types of threats that aren’t usually covered by identity theft: Cyber extortion coverage pays up to $50,000 for cases of blackmail or ransom demands. Online fraud protection will pay up to $10,000 for money that is stolen directly from bank accounts or credit cards through digital scams. These amounts of coverage show how much damage advanced attacks can do.</p>
<p>Access to dedicated case management may be more valuable than money: When someone steals your identity, NordProtect sends a U.S.-based expert to handle the whole recovery process. This case manager talks to credit bureaus, files reports with banks and the police, keeps track of dispute deadlines, and keeps an eye on the case until it is resolved.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Preventing</h2>
<p>NordProtect is currently charging $4.49 a month, which is 71% less than the normal price and it is the lowest price the service has ever been offered at. This makes full identity protection cheaper than most streaming subscriptions or a single trip to a coffee shop. The service comes<strong> with a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to worry about losing money if it doesn’t meet your security needs.</p>
<p>Look at this cost next to the possible costs of recovery. The<em> Identity Theft Resource Center</em> says that people who have their identities stolen spend an average of 200 hours trying to fix the problem. Even at a low hourly wage, this means thousands of dollars in lost productivity. When you add up the costs of hiring a lawyer, buying credit monitoring services after the fact, and possible losses from fake transactions, prevention is much cheaper than reaction.</p>

Every game has its limitations, there is only so many actions you can take, narrative threads to unspool, buttons to press. What about a game that you can only play one round of every day? A game where you "take up the sword against an NPC or another girl-esque thing irl and fight until one of you is holding the lifeless, bloodstained hand of the other." This is the description of a tiny, visceral Yuri Game Jam game called Everyday Sororicide.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Blood Machine and Snek Remilia Ketter, Everyday Sororicide is self-described as a "tragic attempt at conveying the feeling of interacting with another girl on any level beyond superficiality." It is also a game of duels, as mentioned above, to the death. A 1v1 me on Final Destination, not items kind of game, each character bequeathed a sword with which you have a handful of actions. Stab, feint, dodge, jump, slam down, it is simple, yet particular; you have to watch for an opening, the girl-esque thing in front of you won't go down easily, all while drone music blares increasingly aggressively at you.

In its solo mode, you can only play it a single time a day. That's all. It is defiant in its structure, unwilling to bend to your wants of discovering more, of learning why these women feel such desperation to fight each other, of discovering a secret you didn't know you sought after. There's a mystery here made more tantalising by its refusal to be uncovered quickly.
</p><p>
That isn't to say this is a game you can only play once a day, as it actually has a multiplayer mode in which you can do battle with a mate, or, maybe someone you have a toxic situationship with. Seems like the right kind of game for such an activity.

            <p>
The thing about Big Business these days is that when you get Big Numbers, that normally leads to Bigger Business, right up to the point the well has not only dried up, but turned to dust. So, when you have a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, now winner of many Geoff Keighleys and seller of many copies, you might assume that developer Sandfall Interactive would increase the size of their operations. Apparently, you would be wrong!
</p>
<p>
As part of Edge's Knowledge newsletter (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/">GamesRadar</a>), director Guillaume Broche was asked about whether the studio's next project would be a "larger-scale production," to which he responded: "No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself."
</p>
<p>
He continued, "We could scale up now that we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves." Perhaps my favourite bit of the interview is where Broche says that they "love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."
</p>
<p>
Of course, it's still important to remember that discourse causing bit about the fact that Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wasn't made by just 30 people</a>, so it's not like the game was made by a teeny, tiny group of folks. Expansion may still happen, including through utilising more outsourced studios, but it's still nice to hear a company not chasing the money for once.

This is actually a bit higher than it was last weekend, but I still think it's a fantastic price for two games that any RPG fan will appreciate.
