<p>PUBG’s time on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming to an end in November with a transition to current-generation consoles, it has been announced.</p>



<p>As previously announced in the 2025 roadmap, preparations have been made to move the console version of PUBG onto current-gen consoles. Unfortunately for those on last-gen devices, it means an end to official support.</p>



<p>Players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will benefit from improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and reduced crashes. However, the headline is undoubtedly the end of support for last-gen consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-moving-to-current-gen-in-november">PUBG Moving to Current-Gen in November</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, PUBG will no longer be playable or available to download on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on <strong>November 13, 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The end for the platforms will come following live server maintenance on the above date, though the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process for each platform.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that existing account data and purchased items will be “securely preserved,” with players having the ability to log into the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the change to continue playing on an existing account—with no separate transfer required.</p>



<p>While Xbox Series X|S players will have their version upgraded via the platform’s Smart Delivery process on November 13, PS5 players are required to download the new PS5 version of PUBG from the PlayStation Store when the update is live.</p>



<p>In the announcement, it was added that a goal of “fairness across all platforms” is a major priority, with the intention to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To enable this, the Xbox Series S will have selectable options of a Resolution Mode and a Performance Mode.</p>



<p>Is the move to current-gen consoles long overdue for PUBG? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The second weekend of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is getting bigger, with the addition of two game modes and one of the most eye-catching maps for players to duke it out in.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/battlefield-6-launches-10th-october-see-the-multiplayer-trailer-beta-reveal-here/">Battlefield 6 open beta weekend</a> will take place from 14th-17th August, and with no restrictions on who can download and play across PS5, Xbox Series X|S or PC.</p>


<p>After the booming popularity of the first weekend, DICE are expanding what’s on offer in the second weekend with the addition of Rush and Squad Deathmatch modes, as well as adding in the Empire State map, which takes place in New York near to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is in addition to all the maps and modes that were previously available.</p>

<p>The first weekend saw millions of people dive in to check out Battlefield 6, with <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/3081410">SteamCharts tracking over 500,000 players at its peak</a>, and many, many more across other platforms and storefronts. So popular was the beta that server queues were put in place to manage the game’s load.</p>

<p>Officially unveiled last month, Battlefield 6 is a huge production for EA, with the Battlefield Studios comprised of Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios, all with different roles to play in its creation. Criterion and Motive have focused on the single player campaign, which will see NATO attacked and going on the counter-offensive against the private military group known as Pax Armata, and these set out the two sides for the multiplayer as well, with settings that will range from the Middle East through Europe and to the US mainland.</p>
<p>There will be 9 maps at launch, while Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough game modes are joined by the likes of TDM, Squad DM, Domination and KOTH, and more will be added through seasonal updates. Classes are also back alongside ‘signature’ weapons and abilities that fit into the archetypes of games before Battlefield 2042, though there’s a smidgeon of simmering controversy from the default game having a free weapon choice instead of class-locked weapons.</p>
<p>Regardless, the first beta weekend has proven to be exceptionally popular, and EA and the Battlefield Studios will be hoping to ride that wave through to the game’s launch on 10th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nintendo truly are the masters of the controller gimmick, from the dual screens of the DS and Wii U, to the waggling motion controls of the Wii, and detachable Switch Joy-Con. Each one has come with first party games that really showcase their use, and for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors and mouse mode</a>, that game is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive Review – More like&nbsp;Drab x Dunk" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cvF2berYT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Drag x Drive is all about pick up games of wheelchair basketball, with teams of three and the core rules of basketball like the 3-point line rewarding longer shots and a shot clock forcing you to use the ball within 14 seconds all preserved here.</p>


<p>Playing the game requires that you unclip the Joy-Con 2 from your console and then use them as mice, tipping them so the optical sensor faces a tabletop or trouser leg to track your motion inputs. Pushing forward along the surface with your hands pushes your character forward with the corresponding wheel, and it quickly becomes generally intuitive to race forward, turn through corners and navigate the play space, accompanied by a neat ratcheting click effect from the HD Rumble. The triggers then pull the brakes for a quick stop, and can be used on one side for a rapid spin and pivot.</p>


<p>Coming into contact with the ball grabs it and puts it on your character’s lap while you manoeuvre, trying to avoid head-on collisions that will knock the ball loose as you head to the opposing team’s hoop, and there’s a quick and easy pass by tapping both shoulder buttons. Taking a shot, though, relies on motion controls. Pull up your hand and flick in the direction to send the ball flying, with more accuracy coming from the direction you’re facing, speed your going, and distance it has to travel to score.</p>
<p>Extra decimal points come from pulling off a shot with a bit of flair, and there’s a handful of quick tricks that you can pull. There’s quarter pipe ramps at either end of the court that you can use to launch yourself up and go for a dunk –&nbsp;easier said than done –&nbsp;or you can hop up in the air by pulling both brakes and yanking your hands up one after another.</p>

<p>It all combines for some quick and pithy wheelchair basketball action with bitesized three-minute matches. There’s plenty to master here, like the perfect angle to go for a dunk, and it’s difficult to feel truly precise in your actions, to get the subtle turns that you need. Team play could also be rewarded with quick passing getting around a defence, but the end-to-end nature of basketball is definitely here.</p>
<p>The game is wrapped up by the Park, a shared play space for both public and private lobbies. This has a lot of the appearance of a skate park, and it’s littered with challenges to help you learn the controls. There’s races, cone slaloms, obstacle courses, shot challenges, ramp time trials and more. The general matchmaking will mix and match players in a lobby into teams – filling in an AI if there’s an odd number –&nbsp;while matches are broken up with a couple shared minigames. You have preferences to let you engage with or avoid these, as you like, but you can also disconnect and take to the Park solo to practice against bots. That’s the extent of the single player in this game, though.</p>

<p>What’s most surprising about Drag x Drive is just how dour the game’s visuals are. The Park is a grungy, grey warehouse of an arena, and all of the characters default to black and grey clothes, helmets and wheelchairs. Yes, there is colour from the paint inside the 3-point line, around the side of the courts, and from spotlights, and yes, you can change your avatar’s outfit to have different colours, but they’re muted at best, and the overriding memory you’ll have of this game is as grey as the Xbox 360 era was brown.</p>
<p>There’s also a lack of unlockables and cosmetics. Almost everything is available from the off, outside of some helmet designs that are unlocked with challenges. There’s just no personality when everyone is a blank helmeted figure, and that’s a massive gulf between Drag x Drive and the colourful, vibrancy of an ARMS or Splatoon, let alone all of the cosmetics and customisation of Rocket League.</p>

<p>The other aspect is the instant gratification gaming that Drag x Drive can’t quite match. Where ARMS was all about using motion controls for punching, it had the button controls as a fallback, but you don’t have that option with Drag x Drive, so you can’t curl up on the sofa or lie in bed and play. More than that, when wheelchair athletes are at the centre of this game, having motion controls as the only option means that this isn’t really accessible for gamers with certain kinds of limited mobility. That’s disappointing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-drag-x-drive-switch-2-a-real-baller-with-friends-but-is-there-enough-to-do.1268856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> is Nintendo's latest attempt to give us a unique sports game that utilises their latest console's flashy tech. And this time, it isn't just any old sport. If you've ever watched wheelchair basketball, you know how technical it can get, and Drag x Drive takes this to the extreme.</p>
<p>It's a brilliant choice of sport to bring to life with Mouse Mode controls, and one that's been carried off with plenty of skill. The main issue is your mileage is going to vary based on how you get on with these controls. I'm not just talking about their implementation in the actual game; things like how thin (and slightly uncomfortable) the Joy-Con 2 are when on their side, how your wrists fare generally, and what sort of surface or space you're playing with, all come into consideration.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157964/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But let's reverse the old wheelchair for a second, and go over what Drag x Drive entails. Nintendo has gone with an arcade-style take on wheelchair basketball, which lends itself well to exciting 3v3 face-offs. Matches are action-packed, three-minute affairs, and there isn't much room on a court so you're always in close proximity to teammates or opponents. There's also a very pleasing dual-layered learning curve that needs to be approached and overcome at the outset.</p>
<p>Simply getting used to playing the actual basketball by timing your runs, making passes, and choosing to play it safe or go for three-point baskets, means there's plenty to take in and have a good time with. Then you have to consider that you're doing all of this in a wheelchair-like vehicle. I'm the type of person who crashes things at precisely the wrong moment (in games, not in real life!), so getting to blast around freely in one of these things at high speeds, well, it's very exciting. And it stays exciting for longer than I thought possible because the controls are good, for the most part.</p>
<p>In practice, playing on a table worked well for a time, but I found using my legs better, as it's way less hard on your hands and arms once I got used to it. It's impressive that the tech manages to keep the controls so smooth whilst I glided over my very un-ironed trousers. Well met, Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157965/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Mouse Mode, each Joy-Con pertains to a wheel. For example, to move in a straight line, you need to slide both Joy-Con 2 forward simultaneously, then lift to return your hand to the start position to slide again. It apes the real-life motion of pushing your wheels forward. Smooth and controlled slides help you gain speed, and this is very much a game where timing and grace trump going for big power moves and destroying your furniture and arms. You don't need to break into a sweat, just relax your arms and chill. Then you start adding turns and braking in and, well... let's just say you can make some violently fast changes of direction.</p>
<p>Shooting is much simpler, as you simply need to throw up an arm and motion out a shot, and as long as you're facing the basket, you should make it. There's just enough freedom to also give players ways to be a little stylish with tricks and sexy half pipe dunks. And to defend, you just need to roll back to your half and prep for whatever assault your opponent has in mind, block those lanes and get ready for a tackle. Hit an opponent head-on — doesn't matter the speed (again, you never really need to be brute-forcing anything here), as long as you collide in their face — and the ball will spill out of their hands, which is followed by an animated clamour to nab it back.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157969/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are three player styles to select from: Guard, Forward, or Center, and these have different ability levels split between rebounding, strength and quickness. You also get some customisation slots where you can deck out your little space-person with new helmets, colours, and textures. This part of the game is very basic, however, so don't expect a design studio.</p>
<p>If you want to get <em>really</em> flashy on-court, Drag x Drive has a bunch of OTT video game stuff and tricks, like tilting up onto one wheel by braking on the side you want to tilt to and then lifting your Joy-Con up on that side at the same time. Do this on both sides at the same time, and you'll bunny hop! It's satisfying when you manage to pull these off mid-match, but in my experience, some tricks don't come off smoothly enough. It still works, but you can't rely on it 100%. Which is a shame, because as frustrated as I've been at times trying to put together wheeling, turning, passing, and shooting, I keep coming back for more.</p>

<p>All of this gives you plenty to work with as you launch into 3v3 battles against either human or CPU opponents, with matches housed within an arena that can either be set to Friend or Public Park. This arena is also full of side missions and challenges, most of which are designed to help you master the controls. A handful of extra games, such as a race to the checkpoint or chasing after a ball, pop up between matches to help keep things fresh, though you can choose to opt in or out of them entirely if they aren't your cup of tea.</p>
<p>A few other side missions, such as the slalom and shots against the clock, are perfect for getting the hang of sharp turns and nailing your hoop skills, too. I have to say, as much as I think some will baulk at how little there is in the package in terms of separate modes of play (a single-player campaign would have helped), there's a good amount of game to sink your teeth into for the price in Drag x Drive, <em>if</em> you are down for mastering it all.</p>
<p>Turning to online, and this is where the game really shines on the court. I managed to play a whole bunch of games with the rest of the crew here at Nintendo Life, and it works well. GameChat is smooth sailing, and the basketball itself holds up to scrutiny. When playing online, the host can choose to set up so that 12 people are in the party, split between two 3v3 games happening at the same time on separate courts within the same arena. You can also spectate matches and keep things nice and private by having a code to get into your park.</p>

<p>That being said, don't look for any bells and whistles online (or anywhere else); what you see really is what you get. There are no different match types or ways to mix things up besides those minigames I mentioned. Even worse, perhaps, is that the Public Park lobbies don't allow you to play against random players online with a friend (or friends) in any way, as far as I’ve been able to tell.</p>
<p>In private Friend Park lobbies, of course, there's no issue — and you can share your Park ID with whomever you choose — but it's certainly something to keep in mind. It seems you can't just head online with a friend and take on other humans; it's bots or 1v1. Perhaps they'll add a way to do this later down the line, although Nintendo have their own special way of doing things, as we all know.</p>
<p>Another weak point in terms of options is a lack of control customisation, meaning you're stuck with the mice, which can make jumping in online a little daunting. Not to mention it fully excludes some players from getting involved.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration, though, and for the not-enormous price point, there's more depth here than I expected. Drag x Drive feels like a proper attempt to give us something fresh, in the same sort of vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a> back on Switch 1. If you get into its groove, you will get your money's worth.</p>
<p>A final word, though, and as someone who rarely complains about awkward controls (I am a master of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus Uprising</a> on 3DS, after all), even I had to take breaks playing this getting started. My issue isn't so much anything to do with the controls, it's more the physical act of holding the super slim Joy-Con on their side whilst playing. It gets tiring, and for some it's gonna be a real 'NOPE' moment when they start to feel it. I find that, as I relax a bit and don't put so much force into every movement, things get more comfortable, mind. More troublesome is the bunny-hopping and tilting stuff being a little hard to pull off.</p>

<p>In terms of presentation and performance, it all runs absolutely perfectly, that much is nailed down. However, it's a shame Nintendo opted for this strangely barren style. The robots are cute enough, and the unfussy robotic aesthetic is 'fine', but why not give us some more character, or more varied environments?</p>
<p>I can overlook style stuff when the core game is this solid, though. And Drag x Drive is certainly that. In the end, if you have some pals who're into it, and you're willing to master the game, I have no hesitations in recommending this one.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price.</p></section>

						<h5>Drag x Drive</h5><p><span>August 14, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>New Nintendo consoles tend to launch with a mix of heavy-hitters, like Mario and Zelda, and smaller, quirkier projects designed to show off the system’s unique features. So far, the Nintendo Switch 2 has offered plenty of the former with big games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but, surprisingly, not really any of those oddball experimental titles. That's about to change with the release of Drag x Drive, a sci-fi-flavored arcade sports game that closely resembles wheelchair basketball and makes use of the mouse functionality and motion controls of the new Joy-Con 2 controllers in ways only Nintendo could dream up.</p>



<p>Is Drag x Drive a superstar display of the Switch 2's unique features? Or is it just... a drag? Roll on for the answer…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo may largely avoid the comparison in their marketing, but it’s clear Drag x Drive is inspired by the real-life sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_basketball">wheelchair basketball</a>, with teams of three taking to the court in wheeled frames for some ballin’ fun. While there are halfpipe-like ramps at either end of the court for you to do tricks on, the playing field is otherwise a more-or-less standard basketball court. Of course, you can sink standard 2- and 3-pointers, but bonus fractions can also be scored for pulling off tricks (a dunk is usually worth 2.2 points, for instance). This is also a full-on contact sport, with players being able to knock the ball out of opponents' hands by crashing into them. Perhaps none of this sounds particularly out there, but I can assure you, Drag x Drive does set itself apart with a truly unique control scheme.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players use both the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode, with each basically replicating your avatar's left and right arms. Push both Joy-Cons forward on a flat surface to roll forward, push just the left forward to turn right and just the right to go left. Shooting is a simple matter of lifting up one of the Joy-Cons and making a flicking motion when your avatar is facing the basket. Passing is handled automatically with a push of the L and R buttons. There are also a handful of other moves and tricks, like bunny-hops and halfpipe back flips, that can be pulled off with more advanced manipulation of the Joy-Cons. As mentioned before, manage to score a basket during or shortly after one of these tricks and you may get a few bonus points.</p>



<p>So, the big question -- does Drag x Drive's weird control scheme actually work? Well, <em>sort of</em>. The mouse controls are responsive enough, and with practice, you can get quite good at gliding across the floor to your opponent's basket. You may even be able to pull off the occasional dunk or trick.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Where the controls break down, is when players all pile into a pack near the hoop, knocking into each other and scrambling for the loose ball. Drag x Drive's controls just don't work very well for precise turns and movement and a lot of each 3-minute game consists of players smashing into each other and chasing the ball, which means you’re going to be spending a lot of time frantically sliding your Joy-Cons on your table (or thighs, lap desk, or whatever surface you're using to play) trying to properly situate yourself. In these moments the controls often feel inadequate, frustrating, and frankly, tiring.</p>



<p>The latter is not something to take lightly. After only 20 minutes or so of playing Drag x Drive, I'd start feeling a bit of burn in my arms and after 45 minutes I'd start to feel some real pain in my shoulders. As in, "stop or you might do yourself some damage" pain. And this is coming from someone who's relatively physically able and very aware of the importance of playing games ergonomically due to all the time I spend on reviews. I wasn't hunching, I wasn't unnecessarily stressing my body, but I couldn't find a way to play Drag x Drive that didn't hurt after a while.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's definitely some irony in the fact that a game based on wheelchair basketball, a sport created by and for people with disabilities, is so unyielding in its controls, to the point it will be inaccessible for some. Unfortunately, the game's options menu doesn't provide any relief -- the one quirky control scheme Nintendo has devised is all you get, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>All that said, make no mistake, there <em>are </em>moments of fun to be had playing Drag x Drive. Basketball is fun! Basketball with tackling and tricks is even more fun! I could see a more developed version of Nintendo's take on wheelchair basketball, with more control options, being something worth building around. Unfortunately, that version of Drag x Drive doesn't exist.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to its control scheme, Drag x Drive also stands out for its unusually heavy focus on online play for a Nintendo game. Everything in Drag x Drive revolves around Parks, which act as social hubs for friends or matchmade randos to hang out in while you wait for enough players to accumulate for a proper game. There are a couple of minigames you can engage in while hanging around -- a basic race and a ball-chase scramble -- which are mildly diverting, but definitely don't outshine the core basketball action.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are some offline activities you can engage in while hanging around the Park, including games against nine levels of AI opponents and a series of timed challenges. The latter can actually be fairly tricky and compelling in short bursts, and completing them will unlock extra cosmetic choices for your avatar. That said, while not totally non-existent, Drag x Drive’s single-player content is nothing to get overly excited about.</p>



<p>Also nothing to get excited about is Drag x Drive's presentation, which is oddly lifeless, lacking any of the color, character, or general pizzazz you usually expect from first-party Nintendo games. At least the game runs well I suppose, although it would be fairly shocking if it didn't given the simplicity of its presentation.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Drag x Drive will only set you back 20 bucks, but given the game's lack of content and general blandness, even that may be too rich for some folks' blood. Beyond the simple question of content, I'm skeptical the heavily-centered online component of this game will be viable for long. Even during the free Drag x Drive demo, a time when there was more people trying the game out than there may ever be in the future, there was often a shortage of players to fill out games, resulting in me getting stuck in 2-on-2 contests. Perhaps the game will find a dedicated audience, but I’m not sure I see it surviving into overtime.</p>

				<p>Drag x Drive delivers some moments of frenetic multiplayer fun, but an inflexible and physically-demanding control scheme, lack of personality, and dearth of content severely limits the game's long-term appeal. Drag x Drive could have been a solid addition to a larger Wii-Sports-style collection designed to show off the Switch 2's mouse functionality, but on its own, the game is far from a slam-dunk purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1955298424649080992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> the roadmap of updates coming to STALKER 2 for the remainder of 2025. Chief among them is the engine upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.4, which should deliver performance improvements, but new missions and anomalies are also on the way, as well as improvements to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modding tools</a>.</p>



<ul>
<li>Engine update to Unreal Engine 5.4 (for optimization)</li>



<li>Various night vision devices</li>



<li>Binoculars</li>



<li>A-Life updates: various technical improvements, NPCs can't see in the dark as well as before, NPC combat updates, Mutants combat and balance updates</li>



<li>New anomalies</li>



<li>New missions, from old and new friends</li>



<li>New weather scenario</li>



<li>Master difficulty preset</li>



<li>Extended day/night cycle</li>



<li>Stashes loot rework</li>



<li>Stamina and energy drinks rework</li>



<li>Immersive display mode</li>



<li>Player equipment UI update</li>



<li>More UI updates and improvements</li>



<li>Local save backup restoration</li>



<li>Further optimization and anomalies fixing</li>



<li>Zone Kit - Phase 1 to Phase 2: audio modding (Wwise), narrative tools, improved compatibility of various mods that interact with common game systems, enhanced Blueprints modification support, technical improvements and optimization</li>



<li>Discord Holiday event</li>



<li>Also, more STALKER: Legends of the Zone Enhanced Edition improvements and the release of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>We don't yet know the release date for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 version of STALKER 2</a>, but we might get the news at Gamescom 2025, where the build will be playable.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is still no mention of the multiplayer mode or the DLCs, so it's fair to imagine they won't be arriving this year. Indeed, GSC Game World warned fans that even the items on the aforementioned list may be delayed in case of 'Zone instability', which is a funny way to hint at the potential need for further polishing.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, you can find my launch review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/drag-x-drive-is-more-drag-than-drive.1268847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo announced <em>Drag x Drive</em>, a Joy-Con mouse-controlled wheelchair sports game, for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2</a> I was tentatively excited. I have a lot of time for developers trying new things, and sports video games are hardly replete with disability representation. Having been hands-on with the game, however, <em>Drag x Drive </em>has left me baffled and in significant pain.</p><p>As a “driver” — wheeled robots that come in three mostly indistinct flavors: guard, center, and forward — <em>Drag x Drive </em>has you play pickup games of three-on-three wheelchair basketball. You navigate the game by pushing and pulling your Joy-Cons across a surface in a motion vaguely similar to moving a wheelchair. This with a combination of shoulder button inputs and motion controls lets you move, brake, pass, and shoot.</p><p>Those basic controls are initially intuitive. This includes a satisfying controller rumble if you’re moving, and that’s a <em>big </em>if. My <em>Drag x Drive </em>experience revolved around desperately trying to get the Joy-Cons to register consistently across tables, floors, my bed, and my body. Yet, more often than not, I’d be spinning out and losing control while taking umpteen unintended captures — the home button blessedly appears to be disabled while moving the mouse. My driver regularly took both hands off its wheels unbidden in a comical, yet appropriate, shrug.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The game’s 20-minute tutorial tells you to move and then lift the Joy-Cons and to do so in long motions on a flat surface or on your legs. Yet, these actions on their suggested surfaces only contribute to an unresponsiveness that makes controlling <em>Drag x Drive </em>laborious. Any imperfection, be it an uneven table or folds in your clothing, has a significant impact on whether your movements translate appropriately onscreen.</p><p>I found some consistency by sitting cross-legged on my bed, hunched over, using small movements on my bedsheets (and weeping for my 34-year-old back). My legs, too, though error-strewn, were more responsive and quieter than any table I tried. This was especially true — before anyone questions my dedication in finding <em>some way </em>to enjoy this game — when I shaved my upper-legs and used the Joy-Cons on my bare thighs. I can’t tell whether the mouse sensors are too sensitive or not sensitive enough, but it does appear that a soft, malleable, and smooth surface yields the best, if still often frustrating, results.</p><p>If you can get moving, matches are slow and repetitive. Playing bots, loading into the three-minute games took about two minutes, and that wait can be longer online in the hub “Parks,” where you are often forced to wait for other games to finish. The loop of matches is mostly one player wheeling the ball up the court, shooting, and then the opposing team doing the same. Tackling can only be achieved head-on and, with controls that are inconsistent in their responsiveness, intentionally stealing the ball is a major achievement. Similarly, consistent shooting requires being lined up with the basket which is hard at speed, so dunking by riding up the court’s curved edges — something you’ll be doing a lot accidentally anyway — is the best tactic. Some of this sluggishness could be allayed if the games remained chaotic, but after each basket it is impossible to interact with the ball for a few seconds, meaning a delay before play can start again.</p><p>But <em>Drag x Drive </em>isn’t just an onscreen experience, it’s a physical one. This was always going to be an issue for disabled players, but I remain surprised how uncomfortable <em>Drag x Drive </em>is to play — turtling over my bedsheets for grip notwithstanding. I found the narrow claw needed to hold the Joy-Cons in this configuration agonising and lengthy play impossible.</p><p>Controller support is absent. Though, using the Joy-Con as a traditional mouse to navigate menus isn’t so bad (you can also toggle menu movements to the joystick, thankfully). Nor does it appear any additional support, even for the Hori Flex adaptive controller, is planned. Nintendo tells <em>The Verge</em>, “We wanted to focus on the innovative experience of using the Joy-Con 2 mouse and motion controls for this game. However, certain accessibility features can be found and utilized at the hardware system level.”</p><p>What features Nintendo references here, I cannot tell. After <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s reliance on — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis">an initially impressive</a> — system-level accessibility, it’s a concerning trend that Nintendo directs players to system menus rather than implementing mitigations into games. Though, perhaps it’s something we might have seen coming. Despite the obvious conception of these characters, Nintendo has appeared reluctant to acknowledge the disability inspiration behind the game leading up to the its official release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i">reportedly instructing staff</a> to use the term “vehicles” when attendees said “wheelchairs” at hands-on events <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mak0.bsky.social/post/3lmpem4h3fc2p">to the confusion</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thecitywake.bsky.social/post/3lmppixmdhs2t">of many</a>. After several inquiries, Nintendo ultimately tells <em>The Verge</em>, “It has always been the case that the vehicles were inspired by wheelchairs. This was miscommunicated at some events. The gameplay is inspired by a mix of wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, and skateboarding.” It’s notable, however, that the only in-game references to the player characters are the terms “driver” and, on one occasion in the lengthy tutorial, “ballers.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>That said, I could not find <em>anything </em>that might help how frustrating and physically uncomfortable <em>Drag x Drive</em>’s control setup rapidly becomes.</p><p>That’s not to say there are no accessibility considerations in the game. <em>Drag x Drive </em>is visually easy to parse, with opposition players highlighted prominently and indicators for what’s happening offscreen being bright and bold. Nor is it entirely joyless. The controls for shooting, a satisfying and responsive flick of the wrist, are a blast when a shot lands. Though, the crispness of the game’s motion controls <em>do </em>further highlight the mouse controls’ deficiencies. Similarly, Rebound Scramble, one of two minigames that breaks up match play, is fleetingly fun as a madcap dash to catch a bouncing ball, though this too soon gets old. The other minigame, an obstacle course, was nothing but infuriating for me.</p><p>I could see <em>Drag x Drive </em>being a somewhat diverting <em>Rocket League </em>clone if it wasn’t stubbornly attached to Nintendo’s gimmicky, throwback to the Wii attitude to controls or simply a frustrating part of a broader suite of sports a la boxing in <em>Wii Sports</em>. But with sluggish, repetitive matches, two minigames, and a few activities in parks to win mostly useless rewards, it’s hard not to notice just how little <em>Drag x Drive </em>has to offer.</p><p>If I can say one good thing about <em>Drag x Drive</em>: it <em>does </em>demonstrate that a game based on wheelchair sports could be great in the right hands. But if you’re hoping for a fast-paced, representative, or even fun foray into wheelchair basketball, this isn’t it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/758328/drag-x-drive-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the GameCube added to the Nintendo Switch Online library of classic games, and although it contained some bangers, there were only three of them. <em>Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> and <em>F-Zero GX</em> are certainly very welcome, but it would have been nice to see it much more packed out. Well, following the meh addition of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, more are to come, and next to be added to their number later this month is a somewhat less well known title: <em>Chibi-Robo!</em></p> <p>Starring a cute four-inch-tall robot,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo</em><em>!</em> is an action-puzzle game created by a former developer called Skip, Ltd. Best known for the Game Boy Advance’s super-simple “bit Generation” series, the studio also made a bunch of&nbsp;<em>Chibi</em>-based games published by Nintendo, starting with this Game Cube game, the following it up with <em>Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol</em> for the DS and&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em> for the 3DS. The games were certainly not obscure at the time, and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-gamecube-is-now-twenty-years-old-1847670755"><em>Kotaku</em> previously included&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em> in its list of classics when the Game Cube turned 20</a>. In 2013,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/out-of-nowhere-nintendo-announces-new-chibi-robo-game-653832768"><em>Kotaku</em> called it “one of the most underrated games on Nintendo’s GameCube.”</a> But it’s fair to say it’s a franchise that has perhaps slipped out of the broader consciousness. That’s maybe going to change on August 21 when the game arrives on Switch Online for Switch 2.</p> <p>2005’s&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em> (to give it it’s seemingly abandoned full name) is all about completing tasks for the Sanderson family that owns Chibi, but ensuring that your little bot’s batteries never run out. Complete a chore, or help out in a specific situation (whether with the family or the living toys in the household) and you get Happy Points! Who doesn’t want Happy Points? You explore the whole house, looking for mess to clear up, people and toys to help, and generally try to make yourself the most useful little robot in the world. And yeah, I’m in.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Chibi-Robo!</p> <p>Join him on his quest to restore order to the Sanderson house and save the world in Chibi-Robo!, coming to Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitchOnline</a> + Expansion Pack members on Aug 21! <a href="https://t.co/BWjL2CbHdL">pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1955434299185926504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The game’s reviews at the time ran the full gamut. The infamously tough markers at <em>EDGE</em> gave it an incredibly respectable 8, while&nbsp;<em>A.V. Club</em> gave it a kicking. However, most people came down positive but not blown away, resulting in a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/chibi-robo/critic-reviews/?platform=gamecube">Metacritic average of 75</a>. (It’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/chibi-robo-zip-lash-the-kotaku-review-1736997537">2015 sequel didn’t fair so well</a>.) It’ll be interesting to see how that garish GameCube 3D feels to play today.</p> <p>Skip’s last game was released in 2015, but despite a previously close relationship with Nintendo, the company went quiet for many years, likely closing entirely in 2019 or 2020 but never officially announcing its ignominious end. Which is kinda sad. A few former developers left to form Tiny Wonder Studio, which last year had <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinywonderstudio/korobo/">a successful Kickstarter to make a&nbsp;<em>very</em> familiar-looking game called&nbsp;<em>koROBO</em></a>. It’ll be interesting to see if Nintendo is hoping to revive interest in the franchise, given there’s clearly a team interesting in making it.</p> <p>So August 21 for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, but we still don’t have dates for the other games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Nintendo-GameCube-Nintendo-Classics-2838110.html">listed</a> as “upcoming” by Nintendo. That list is:</p> <ul> <li><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></li> <li><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em></li> <li><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em></li> <li><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em></li> <li><em>Pokémon Colosseum</em></li> </ul> <p>Come on Nintendo! Hurry up and add them! It’s not like they haven’t all been eminently playable on emulation for literally decades. We wanna play them again!</p> <p>They join the current collection of:</p> <ul> <li><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em></li> <li><em>F-ZERO GX</em></li> <li><em>Soul Calibur II</em></li> <li><em>Mario Smash Football</em></li> </ul>

<p>Black Ops 7 news and leaks are starting to come thick and thin. A Tac-Sprint rumor suggests that the developer is toying with the idea of removing Tac-Sprint altogether from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, it’s claimed.</p>



<p>Tac-Sprint is an auto-run mechanic allowing you to move faster in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD</a>. It comes with a strict penalty, though: A slightly slower time to aim. Many skilled players have been able to master the nuances of the movement. But there are also plenty of people who wish it weren’t in the game. If you’re one of those people, you might get your wish.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-reportedly-trying-out-no-tac-sprint">Black Ops 7 Reportedly Trying Out No Tac-Sprint</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be very divisive. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak/report comes from one <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>—one of Call of Duty’s most renowned insiders—who claims to have new information on Tac-Sprint.</p>



<p>“There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign,” they said on X.</p>



<p>Now, they have previously reported that Tac-Sprint <em>is</em> in the game. This has probably been the case in the past, but new developments can always arise. It’s quite likely that a lack of Tac-Sprint in some capacity is being tested for Black Ops 7.</p>

<p>Whether the feature makes it into the full game remains to be seen. We’ll keep you updated on the latest rumors and leaks. Are you hoping Tac-Sprint sits BLOPS 7 out?

            <p>If you've tried to pay for something on Steam via PayPal over the past month and a bit, only to be told you can't, Valve have now offered an explanation as to why, pointing to a bank that previously handled PayPal transactions in certain currencies as having suddenly terminated its support.</p>
<p>Folks in affected countries first noticed notifications informing them PayPal was "currently unavailable" in their part of the world <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1lxtux9/paypal_temporarily_disabled_since/">around a month ago</a>. There's been a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m15oki/why/">steady</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m67k41/is_anyone_else_having_trouble_paying_with_paypal/">stream</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mjto06/paypal_no_longer_available_in_the_philippines/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m9pi7t/so_paypal_stopped_working_on_steam_in_all_of/">posts</a> from folks who've gotten to checkout and been told this since then.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While those examples didn't see Valve offer any further explanation of what was up, a player has now been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">directed to one</a>, with the same message having been added to Steam's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp">support page for purchasing issues</a>.</p>
<p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD." Hence folks in nations that don't use euros, pounds, yen, or dollars of the Canadian / American / Australian variety being unable to buy Steam's wares via PayPal.</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," Valve continued. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve and PayPal for comment.</p>
<p>As of writing, it's unclear whether this is related to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">Valve's recent policy changes</a> regarding adult content on Steam, which they claim were in response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">pressure from payment processors</a> and other financial parties like acquiring banks (who themselves look to have been pressured by anti-porn campaign group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a>) last month. It might be unrelated: while Valve have only offered the vague window of "early July" as the point when PayPal began backing out, the earliest Reddit post I've found from someone affected is dated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1lxtux9/paypal_temporarily_disabled_since/">July 12</a>, which looks to pre-date the adult games/payment processor drama kicking off by at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">a few days</a>.</p>
<p>At least now folks aren't left wondering if this is just a temporary outage and/or routine maintenance. Hopefully Valve can find a way to at least offer those using affected currencies more alternative options when they push their cart full of Euro Truck Sim DLC and... other stuff that's not Euro Truck Sim DLC to the till.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge flood of gaming news is on the horizon with Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 right around the corner. For all the details you need, look no further than our guide.</p>



<p>The latter months of 2025 have been blown wide open following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-gta-6-delayed-release-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s delay</a> until next year, with plenty of new release dates expected to be announced during Opening Night Live. While not all will release this year, it should pack the schedule with a load to be excited about.</p>



<p>To make sure you don’t miss out on any of the fun, use our dedicated guide for a breakdown of all the important information. </p>







<figure><figcaption>Lock in. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on Tuesday, August 19. As the name suggests, it marks the start of the entire Gamescom event.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a variety of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several playable titles, ranging from Hollow Knight: Silksong to Borderlands 4, and online showcases from Xbox, Bethesda, and the Future Games Show.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 takes place at 11am PT/1pm CT/2pm ET/7pm BST/4am AST (August 20).</strong></p>



<p>The showcase is expected to start bang on time, with no initial countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in and ready. If you do miss any of the announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all of the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the times in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">13:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">14:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 (Aug. 2)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 will be available to watch directly on both YouTube and Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow live streams such as this due to the fact that it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. So, if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly advise watching through Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform suits you, though, and remember to keep your eyes peeled to Insider Gaming for all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>



<p>You can also watch ONL through the <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom</a> website, while clips and trailers will likely be posted on TikTok.</p>







<p><span><b>Gamescom ON</b></span><strong>L</strong><span><b> 2025 takes place in Cologne, Germany, the home of </b>Gamescom<b>. Specifically, it’s at Hall 1 of the Koelnmesse.</b></span></p>



<p>A live audience is in attendance, with the event ticketed as part of the Gamescom event itself, with fans, media, and streamers in attendance to react to the latest news and reveals. Those with a ticket are advised to arrive by 6pm, with admission closing half an hour before the start.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom ONL is expected to have a runtime of two hours, as shown by the events schedule on the official website.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to Summer Games Fest and the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley will host the event filled with new game announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and special guests. </p>

            <p>There were plenty of exciting announcements in last night’s VR Games Showcase but one of the games that really caught my attention was the VR port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lushfoil-photography-sim">Lushfoil Photography Sim</a> from</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> and Matt Newell. Described by Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lushfoil-photography-sim-review">Lushfoil review</a> as minimalist and luxurious, Lushfoil Photography Sim looks pretty as a picture and, played in VR, it could scratch that same, relaxing, photorealistic (pun not intended) itch as Kayak VR: Mirage.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below for a look at the game in action in VR, although you'll obviously only get the true experience when you're wearing the headset.</p>

<p>At the moment the VR version of Lushfoil is only confirmed for PC via Steam VR. Lushfoil also released on PS5, so it's not impossible we'll see it ported to PS VR2 in the future. If Annapurna Interactive makes an announcement on this in the coming months we'll let you know. No firm release date for the PC VR version of Lushfoil has been announced, but it's coming soon.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publishers Krafton have issued their response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">lawsuit filed against them</a> by the game's former lead developers. If you're wondering whether things have cooled off a bit between the two parties now we're in Saul Goodmanville, think again, because the second paragraph of the response sees Krafton accuse the leads of having "resorted to litigation to demand a payday they haven't earned."</p>
<p>It's an almost impossible task at this point to sum up the Subnautica 2 saga in less than a War and Peace length novel, but here's my attempt to give you the abbreviated version. Krafton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delay the game from a 2025 early access release to 2026</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire three leads on it</a>: Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill. The company accuse those leads of abandoning their duties and argue the game wasn't ready for early access. The leads disagree and file a lawsuit. A big part of what makes the disagreement so noteworthy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million bonus</a> to be paid to Unknown Worlds staff if the game hit certain targets by the end of 2025, which Krafton have now said they'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">still pay out a fraction of</a>. Annnnddd breathe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That takes us up to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">this response</a> from Krafton to the three ousted devs' lawsuit. In it, the company argues that "rather than investing the effort necessary" to meet the conditions for earning their bit of the bonus, the trio are merely attempting to extract that cash through legal action.</p>
<p>The not-putting-in-the-effort part leads onto the publishers once again arguing their view that the trio "quickly lost interest" in developing Subnautica 2 after Krafton bought Unknown Worlds in a $500 million deal, and promised that additional $250 million payout linked to Subnautica 2's success. Cleveland and McGuire, the response says, went off to do other stuff, while Gill is claimed to have "focused on leveraging his operational control to maximise the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game." The game's design director is cited as having said the former two leads were "checked out."</p><p>Krafton go on to suggest that problems with Subnautica 2 were revealed via a March 2024 internal assessment, but rather than working to improve it, the leads "blamed others and overhauled the team" and "continued to reduce the scope of the game." Roll forwards to breaking point. Krafton then claim that they were concerned releasing Subnautica 2 into early access in an undercooked state could cause "irreversible harm" to the series' name and future potential, pointing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> as an example of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-early-access-review">such reputational damage</a>.</p>
<p>Krafton pushed for the delay, and allege the three leads not only opposed that move, but said they would self-publish the game. The company also claim the trio "secretly downloaded massive amounts of confidential information" from Unknown Worlds. Basically, Krafton's view is that Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill only cared about getting that $250 million payout, and were prepared to put out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-delay-actually-proves-krafton-arent-mismanaging-their-games-says-exec">whatever version of the game they had</a> on time to get it. Or, as the publishers put it:</p>
<blockquote>The Key Employees' insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout. At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding 'a timeline that doesn't tank the earnout opportunity' and scheduling the release to maximize their payments. Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the [Key Employees'] focus was on their payday, and not on the game.</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the response sees Krafton provide direct rebuttals to different elements of the ex-leads' lawsuit, but as you can see here, despite all the Lionel Hutz language, punches are very much not being pulled whatsoever in this legal drama. We'll have to see if Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill issue any response, but otherwise we're likely into the part where all the lawyers get to work lawyering:a back-and-forth that could lead to court proceedings if both parties can't come to an arrangement before then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following a successful early access launch on PC, inZoi’s unique brand of life-sim gameplay is set to arrive on PS5 in 2026. It looks to include upcoming DLC and should be fully optimized for the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-inzoi-money-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inZoi</a> was heralded as a rival to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-reiterates-plans-for-the-sims-4-multiplayer-the-sims-5-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a>—in case you’ve forgotten, it’s the game that initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you run over children</a>. With EA’s series into the hundreds of millions in terms of copies sold, there’s a lot of catching up to do. inZoi achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-1-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies sold</a> within its first week.</p>



<p>Numbers have dropped off since, but this is to be expected. A PS5 release could be what inZoi needs to get back into the picture.</p>



<h2 id="h-could-inzoi-rival-the-sims-domination">Could inZoi Rival The Sims’ Domination?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hot and steamy on PS5. Credit to Inzoi Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a press release, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton</a> declared: “inZOI, its immersive life simulation game, will launch on PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2026. The PS5 version will be fully optimized for console, bringing players the same robust gameplay experience featured on PC.”</p>



<p>The port features “All of the key systems and features that define the PC experience, reworked for console controls and performance to ensure a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Running over children was eventually declared a bug</a>, so don’t expect to do that on PS5. However, the first major DLC expansion is on the way in 2025—Island Getaway. I’d expect this to come with the PS5 launch, but it remains to be seen if it’s free.</p>



<p>Have you played inZoi on PC? Is there any potential at all for it to challenge The Sims, or other life-sim legends like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4.1268766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 6 Season 4 is well underway in Fortnite, with a bunch of new Weekly Quests to complete, and locating Shadow Briefings is required if you want to net a handy boost for your Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Shadow Briefings are not new in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=Fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, instead being guaranteed in pretty much every chapter and season that features, but the spawn locations can vary. As such, it can be difficult to track them down in times of need.</p>



<p>We’re here to make things easier, however, by pointing you in the direction of all the Shadow Briefings locations in Chapter 6, Season 4. We’ve also included our tips on the best landing spots to help you complete the quest.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4">Fortnite Shadow Briefings Locations in Chapter 6 Season 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pick your spot. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Shadow Briefings spawn randomly at the start of each game, though they do have set spawns—which we’ve highlighted on the map above.</strong></p>



<p>Given the spawns are random, there are no guaranteed spots where you can secure Shadow Briefings. However, as the map shows, some areas are better than others, with a few potential spawns in close proximity. </p>



<p>The best spots I’ve found are:</p>



<ul>
<li>South of the Burd To Go in the northwest of the map.</li>



<li>The Resistance Base in the northeast of the map.</li>



<li>O.X.R HQ in the mid-west of the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>Heading to these locations is a great starting point in your hunt, given the potential spawns nearby. They also offer a decent haul of loot, so you will be well prepared if you encounter enemy players.</p>



<p>It may still take a few matches to tick off the quest entirely, however, but with these locations at your disposal, it won’t take too much time to knock out. You can also revisit the same spot if you enter a different match. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-amp-accept-shadow-briefings-in-fortnite">How to Find &amp; Accept Shadow Briefings in Fortnite</h2>



<p><strong>As you approach a Shadow Briefing spawn in Fortnite, a white laptop will appear on your map marking the location.</strong></p>



<p>To complete the weekly quest, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to one of the locations on the map above to find a Shadow Briefing.</li>



<li>Approach the briefcase and interact with it to accept a mission.</li>



<li>Complete this step three times to tick off the Weekly Quest.</li>
</ol>



<p>As the Weekly Quest only tells you to find and accept Shadow Briefings, you don’t need to complete the missions they provide. However, if you do, you can net yourself some decent loot and some additional experience.</p>

Especially with a gaming audience that is highly sensitive to inauthentic or overly commercial content, what matters are bold ideas, local sensitivity, and creators who work for lasting impact, not just quick profit.”</p><p>Sidekick Publishing co-CEO and co-founder Melvin Frank added, “Over the past year, we’ve worked on a variety of releases—each one teaching us something new about what works, what connects, and what lasts for our concept. Sidekick is our way of taking all those lessons, combining them with our unique creator and community expertise, and raising the bar for how we support indie developers. The goals are simple: focus on games that resonate well with our approach and make every next launch our best one yet.”</p><p>The first game slated for release under the Sidekick Publishing brand will be 2.5D pixel zombie apocalypse <a title="Genres > Roguelike [352 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> <a title="Genres > Action [2,926 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> <em><a title="Games > Deadly Days: Roadtrip" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/deadly-days-roadtrip">Deadly Days: Roadtrip</a></em> from developer <a title="Companies > Pixelsplit [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pixelsplit">Pixelsplit</a>, which is due out for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,886 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3026450/Deadly_Days_Roadtrip/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> hasn't been flush with new releases, I think it's fair to say, but Nintendo has offered up a nice lot of games in its Nintendo Classics games portal. The next GameCube game to arrive has been revealed, and it's the wonderful Chibi-Robo!</p>
<p>Classic GameCube games are an exclusive feature of the Nintendo Switch 2 and are only available to players who have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Chibi-Robo! joins a line-up that already includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Super Mario Strikers, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Chibi-Robo, Nintendo has released a trailer for the Nintendo Classic release which you can watch below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-coming-to-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration.1268739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (an internal developer of Krafton) <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that their namesake game will be released <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a> in early 2026, while an Xbox port is still under consideration:</p>



<p><em>We‘re excited to announce that inZOI is scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5) in 2026.</em> <em>Our team is working hard to bring you the best possible experience on PS5. (An Xbox release is also under consideration, but not yet confirmed.) The official release date and additional details will be shared at a later time.</em></p>



<p>inZOI is a life simulation game that debuted on Steam Early Access on March 28. It had a lot of hype going for it, as it proved when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller just one week after launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mixed', with only 47% of the 618 reviews left in the last month giving it a thumbs up. Some fans believe that inZOI needs a lot more content and features before it can launch out of early access. </p>



<p>Given the projected early 2026 PS5 launch and the fact that early access games do not generally debut before version 1.0 on Sony's console, it's a fair assumption that the developers are sticking to their original one-year early access phase. The 1.0 release on PC and PS5 could therefore be internally scheduled for March 2026, though of course, the team should do well to heed the community's concerns and possibly delay the full launch if it serves the purpose of addressing their feedback and delivering a better final product.</p>



<p>In June, inZOI also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-gets-official-modkit-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received an official Modkit update</a> that allows users to craft and share user-generated content (UGC) with a specific tool available for free via the Epic Games Store. It is unclear whether that will be available on PlayStation 5; consoles are usually more restrictive in this area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 already boasts over 600,000 pre-order sales on Steam and has a whopping wishlist total of 2.7m, according to new data.</p>



<p>The EA title is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of the year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a million players</a> jumping in during the first Open Beta weekend. The Battlefield 6 Open Beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/">return</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/"> this weekend</a> and could hit similar numbers, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and modes being added.</a></p>



<p>While Open Beta numbers don’t necessarily guarantee success, it appears the stars are aligning for EA with Battlefield 6 as the pre-order sales and wishlists on Steam suggest the community is ready to purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-eye-watering-pre-order-data">Battlefield 6’s Eye-Watering Pre-Order Data</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Impressive. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, over 600,000 pre-orders have been placed for Battlefield 6 on Steam, while a whopping 2.7m players have added the title to their Steam wishlist.</p>



<p>The data adds that this translates to revenues of around $35m on Steam alone, with Battlefield 6 sitting at number two last week for revenues on Steam and number three for totalsales. Of course, this only equates to one platform, too.</p>



<p>Battlefield’s 6 impressive numbers have been rising for a while, however, taking just a few days to surge past the 500,000 wishlist mark when the game was added to Steam last month, including a staggering period from July 25 to 30 with between 95,000 and 150,000 players adding the game to their wishlists each day.</p>



<p>Those numbers put Battlefield 6 in sixth position in Steam’s top wishlisted games, behind only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, Light No Fire, and ARC Raiders. </p>
