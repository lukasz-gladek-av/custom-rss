			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has launched in a great technical state, bucking the trend of games launching in rather poor states in the 2020s, and feeling almost old-school in this, according to a new in-depth technical analysis shared online.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios, highlighting how going with CryEngine was a winning choice. Even in its DirectX 12 form, the game engine developed by Crytek delivers an essentially stutter-free experience even on mid and low-end hardware. On a fairly old Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 4060 GPU with a truncated PCIe bus, targeting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution at medium settings, which include demanding real-time software ray-traced global illumination, smoothness was impeccable even in areas with high NPC density, with no traversal or shader compilation stuttering, which is quite impressive considering the game doesn't feature visible shader pre-compilation, likely conducted instead during load times and during the game itself in an asynchronous manner that burdens the CPU less, thus allowing even an old CPU to handle the game smoothly. Put against other open-world RPGs running on different engines, like Dragon's Dogma 2 and Avowed, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is the definitive winner in terms not only of performance but of visual quality as well, as the two other games definitely don't deliver the same quality even at similar medium settings.</p>
<p>Besides going over Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's smooth performance, the Digital Foundry analysis goes over the game's excellent lighting and environments, how the Ultra settings are not really worth much, some optimization tips, and more. You can check out the analysis in full below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-cracks-down-on-blitz-tool-but-promises-amnesty-for-users.1115559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase has announced a crackdown on popular third-party app Blitz, which players have been using to track damage statistics, ban certain heroes, and more.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/509572974349647985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, NetEase says that Blitz "injects itself" into the game's process, allowing users to view "confidential information like damage and healing statistics". Not only that, but the tool also allows players to predict enemy ultimate cooldowns and "selectively ban heroes", which NetEase says "severely undermin[es]" fairness.</p>

<p>As such, NetEase says it's officially deemed Blitz to be "cheating software", and so using it in the game is no longer allowed. If you've got Blitz installed and you're using it for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's probably best to uninstall it, and if you aren't using it yet, I wouldn't recommend starting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=vFZbDV8M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=sMYnfYxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using Blitz in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is now tantamount to cheating, NetEase says.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you have used the tool in the past, NetEase says that you "will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games".</p>

<p>The developer closes by imploring players not to use any third-party plugins in order to "uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account", so it sounds like you'll face a ban if you are caught using Blitz.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Blitz, it's a tool that provides overlays for multiplayer games like <i>League of Legends</i>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;until today.</p>

<p>Its use is tolerated by other game companies; in fact, according to Blitz itself, the tool is <a href="https://support.blitz.gg/hc/en-us/articles/4415398467737-Can-I-get-banned-for-using-Blitz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially recognized by Riot</a>, so&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' stance is perhaps a little unusual among games for which players use the tool.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=DqOueOYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=msI5W1sD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blitz's use in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is all but endorsed by Riot.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a third-person hero shooter that's essentially&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with Marvel characters. Heroes like Iron Man, Venom, and Storm do battle across a variety of maps, completing objectives like protecting certain areas or escorting moving objects to their destination.</p>

<p>The game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hit 40 million registered players</a>, according to developer NetEase, but that didn't stop the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and laying off all of its employees.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is continuing its run as the best-selling game in the United States (US), taking the top spot for January 2025. It’s the fourth month in a row it has been at number one.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, three of the top five spots remained the same with Madden 25 coming in second and EA Sports FC 25 being the fourth-best-selling title. Throughout the rest of the list comes a plethora of changes, including games like Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth having a resurgence after its release on Steam. For comparison, the game was ranked 56th in December 2024.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five was Minecraft, which jumped up from ninth. </p>



<p>For those looking for new games, only one made the list in January as Donkey Kong Country Returns debuted at number eight. However, in addition to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, four games finished in the top 20 after being well outside in December</p>

                <p>In late 2019, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene offered the first glimpse of his next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-next-game-prologue-i/1100-6472284/" data-ref-id="1100-6472284">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>. Unlike PUBG, Prologue isn't a shooter or a battle royale. Instead, it's a survival game that pits players against bitterly cold elements and a treacherous environment. According to Greene, Prologue's extreme difficulty may cause some players to initially hate it, but he also believes they will eventually embrace it.</p><p>"I expect a lot of people will hate it," Greene told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/i-expect-a-lot-of-people-will-hate-it-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-doesnt-care-if-his-new-game-is-too-hard-for-players-to-handle-as-long-as-it-elicits-a-reaction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "But that's ok if it elicits a reaction--that's all I want. People didn't get [Battle Royale] at first, but then they did. And I think it's the same with this, the goal here is creating these big, massive worlds for everyone. We already have a demo on Steam, and people understand what it is. So, if it causes a reaction, fantastic. I'll happily talk to them and go, 'Well, yeah, it doesn't handhold because that doesn't serve a purpose.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932"></a><figcaption>A camp fire keeps the player alive in Prologue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg"></figure><p>The player's goal in Prologue is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located on an 8x8 km map.

		<p>The creator of My Friend Pedro has declared his next mission: to blast his way into Hell and arrest Satan. Yup, that’s the plot for the newly revealed ballistic platformer Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital and by DeadToast Entertainment, Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch later this year, but what would you know? It’s Steam Next Fest, so t<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">here’s a demo now available for PC</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After the balletic combat of My Friend Pedro, solo developer DeadToast has leant into the use of multiple firearms to get through levels. Shotgun Cop Man casts players as the titular lead-slinging cop, heading right down into Hell with the mission to arrest the dark lord armed with nothing bu a shotgun in one hand and a pistol in the other.</p>
<p>These ludicrously overpowered firearms are more than strong enough to propel Shotgun Cop Man through the levels, launching and bouncing him up and over obstacles, acting like Flappy Bird’s wings… but more murdery.</p>

<p>The game will feature feature a hand-crafted campaign, while hardcore fans will enjoy that each level has No Damage and Speedrun achievements to chase after. There will be support for user-generated levels as well.</p>
<p>The demo is out now on Steam featuring 17 levels from the full game.</p>
<p>We loved DeadToast’s last outing with My Friend Pedro. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">our review</a> of that sensationalist side-scrolling shooter, Nick said, “If you’ve seen John Wick before, you’ll see Keanu killing about ten villains in mere seconds without breaking a sweat and with insane precision. My Friend Pedro gives you a pretty good idea of what it’s like to be Mr Wick, with time slowing down to a crawl, giving you ample time to shoot everyone in the room. Even better, whenever you kill an enemy, the slow time bar replenishes, enabling you to pull off even more crazy stunts.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/january-2025-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-45-year-over-year-in-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Total video games sales in the United States (US) for January 2025 have fallen 15% year-over-year with hardware taking the biggest nose dive. This comes from the latest information for Circana and continues a trend of declining sales across the board.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlzmm42w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the data company</a>, January 2025 saw hardware sales fall by a massive 45% to $205 million while accessories fell 28% to $194M compared to January 2024. The $205 million in hardware spending represents the lowest January total for hardware since January 2020 saw just $131 million.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that January 2025’s data accounts for four weeks while January 2024 was five weeks. However, with drops that substantial, one more week likely isn’t something that would’ve made much of a difference.</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella says that double-digit percentage drops happened across all of the major consoles. Nintendo Switch, which has its successor launching this year, fell 53% year-over-year while Xbox fell 50%. PlayStation 5 came in third, but still dropped 38% in total.</p>



<p>Despite the drop, PlayStation 5 remained the top-selling console in terms of both units and dollars. Xbox Series was second in dollars while Switch was second in units sold.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, the PlayStation Portal remained the top-selling accessory in terms of dollars. For units sold, the DualSense Wireless Midnight Black controller led the way.</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding the sales of the PlayStation 5 Pro, Piscatella says that its sales pace has fallen behind that of the PlayStation 4 Pro after three months.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/moroi-preview-macabre-weird-and-mysterious-in-all-the-right-ways.1115508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/moroi-preview-macabre-weird-and-mysterious-in-all-the-right-ways<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the first time I really understood what Moroi was, I mean the down-in-your-bones feeling you get when you’re playing something and the lighting bolt of understanding strikes you right on the noggin, was when my character fed himself to a talking meat-grinder because “something inside [him] screams let's do it!” Admittedly, it would have probably been funnier if Moroi had flashed a game over screen, and most games might’ve as a gag, but Moroi plays it straight. Into the meat-grinder you go, head-first. It chews for a bit and spits you out. You taste terrible, you see, and the grinder’s palate for manflesh is, for whatever reason, a bit more refined. Later on, you can offer it a severed hand (don’t ask) and it’s happy about that, and to grind up the bones and turn the leftover dust over to you so you can use it to help an old woman make “soup” (again, don’t ask), but eating the hand causes it to explode. “You are on fire,” your character remarks glibly as the machine spits binary. But you have your bone dust and it’s not your job to save sentient meat grinders who have developed a taste for longpig, so off you go to break some more stuff. And I said, out loud, “Ah, it’s a game like <em>that</em>.” And I was intrigued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The word moroi comes from Romanian folklore; it’s used to describe a vampire or ghost, or in some cases, a phantom that rises from the grave to draw energy from the living. I don’t know which part of the definition Moroi the game draws from. What I do know is this: your character, a bearded bear of a man, wakes up in a strange prison, in pain, with no memory of how he got there. Everyone else seems to know him, but he doesn’t recognize any of them. But maybe, as a very tall man in a very strange hat tells him, that’s for the best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Moroi</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your first order of business is to get out, and that means solving simple puzzles, many of which boil down to “acquire item, take it somewhere.” Go talk to the cannibal eating himself as performance art who asks that, if eating himself isn’t his magnum opus, lightning strikes him dead. When lightning strikes him dead, take his severed hand and bring it to the sentient meat grinder, who gives you bone dust before catching fire. Then you take that to the tall man in the funny hat, who tells you to take it to the old lady making soup (she needs some salt; you have bone dust. Same thing, right?) before reminding you that “Death will meet you soon enough” and weirdly offering up that his name is Edgar. So it’s off to the old woman, who gratefully accepts your “salt” and is pulled headfirst into the cauldron by the soup to see what’s on the other side. “I'm starting to think that wasn't soup,” your character says. Noticing a pattern here?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion execution that drops health.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On and on it goes, whether it’s a toenail from an overfed corpse still being pumped full of… something, or taking the old woman’s spoon and using it to wake up the rat with the important job of running in his wheel and powering The Horrors (and the doors). But then something strange happens. Moroi gives you a sword, and throws a bunch of enemies at you, and that’s where the magic happens. Combat is simple — the top-down, twin-stick perspective seems a little weird when you’re solving puzzles, but then you get to a combat section and it’s like “<em>Oh</em>” — but it’s fast and hits feel weighty and satisfying and it’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion executions that drops health. And then you get a minigun that shoots harpoons. And that’s rad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Moroi is flipping between the two — quick, simple puzzles like using the number of corpses in a freezer to work out a door code, and combat sections against multiple enemies howling for blood like it’s Black Friday and you’ve just snatched the last George Foreman grill — it’s pretty grand. But there’s also plenty of weird stuff beyond that, too. At one point, you save a duck with human teeth from being turned into a wide variety of duck-based cuisine and he rewards you with his teeth so you can reinforce your weapon, and then explains the way out through bloody gums. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes messages pop up on-screen offering cryptic hints at something more. Other times, story details are left to collectibles scattered around the environment. I particularly liked the one that listed Duck of Eternal Torment as a type of potential meal prepared from our toothy friend, and the one where the cleaning lady resigns because the furniture is upside down every day and she’s convinced the place is cursed and/or haunted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s never afraid to be weird. One of my Moroi demo’s last segments thrust me into the role of a strange, winged doll tasked by his mother (another doll) with helping his brothers – an increasingly rude group of trees – survive some incoming horror that’s killing all of them by literally giving away pieces of himself to do it. It’s an odd segment, but a compelling one, and when the credits rolled shortly thereafter, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it, but I am interested in seeing where it goes from here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some things about Moroi that concern me: my demo was buggy (It crashed once;I got stuck between a door and a bookcase a couple times; once I fell through the floor) and some of the writing is uneven. But those are things that can be ironed out. Moroi marries the macabre and the mysterious, and it often went to places I didn’t see coming in my half-hour demo. I’m still not sure what a moroi is in this context, but I would like to find out. After all, who can resist a game with a meat grinder that lusts for the flesh of men and a duck with human teeth?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

With only one new game release cracking the top 20 and the predictable domination of Call of Duty, there's little to crow about from last month... except, perhaps, what may be a comeback story for one of last year's alleged sales disappointments: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth debuted February 2024 to No.2 on Circana's charts, which rank video games by dollar sales in the U.S. It dropped to No.7 the following month, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-the-us">finished out the year at No.17</a>. While those numbers are respectable, post-launch there were numerous questions about whether or not the game had done well enough for Square Enix's tastes, or even especially well in comparison to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-are-fine-but-its-no-dragons-dogma-2">other major RPGs in the same year like Dragon's Dogma 2 or its predecessor Final Fantasy 7: Remake</a>. Square Enix ultimately came out saying the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">failed to meet its sales expectations</a>, and never even announced a sales figure, suggesting it hadn't done well enough to brag about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But notably, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth launched as a platform-exclusive on PS5, and exclusives usually face an uphill battle compared to cross-platform releases when it comes to sales. As of January 2025, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth is exclusive no more, finally debuting on Steam and shooting up to No.3 on the Circana charts for the month from No.56 in December. The Final Fantasy 7: Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack similarly rose from No.265 in December to No.16 in January thanks to the Steam release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lhc3xrqq7k2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on Bluesky earlier this month</a> that Rebirth had a "fantastic" Steam launch: "Across physical &amp; tracked digital, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was the best-selling game of the week ending Jan 25th in the US market ($ sales), while the FFVII Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack ranked 3rd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that's just the U.S., but it's likely this is emblematic of similar sales abroad, which when combined could signal to Square Enix that change is needed. This success inevitably invites speculation that swelling sales thanks to a PC launch may shift the company's plans for future Final Fantasy releases to a cross-platform launch. I asked Piscatella for his opinion on the situation, and here's what he said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean it's hard for me to say what impact the Steam release has on publisher perception of overall title success. That's subject to all kinds of internal planning and expectations I'm not privy to, of course. But purely looking at consumer response, it was a very good launch month on Steam. This launch does provide yet another benchmark that shows releasing on PC makes a ton of sense at this point regardless of genre or historical release strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 3rd party publishers, it's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll just have to wait and see what Square Enix's reaction is at its next relevant earnings call...in May. Stay tuned.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of the charts, it will surprise no one that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game of the month again, followed by Madden NFL 25. The only new release cracking the top 20 in January was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country: Returns</a> on Nintendo Switch, which reached No.8 purely on the basis of physical sales (Nintendo does not share digital sales data for its eshop).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also notable was the return of It Takes Two to the top 20, in spot No.20. There's no single reason for this, Piscatella told me. "There has been promotion happening during the month, including the last week of Jan on both the PlayStation store and eShop," he said. "But really, It Takes Two had pretty steady sales all month. But it was in December that It Takes Two really started its latest rally with both sales and engagement upticks that extended into January."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, much of the promotion for It Takes Two comes ahead of the release of Hazelight Studios' next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, releasing in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, games spending numbers actually look a bit sad in January compared to last January, but there's one potential reason for that. This year's tracking period for January was four weeks long, while 2024's January was five weeks long, so that's a whole extra week to make money. But as a result, overall spending was down 15% to $4.5 billion for the month this year (it was 0.3% ahead of January 2023's four-week period). Accessories spending was down 28% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content spending was down 12% compared to last year, with console content down 35%. Hardware spending was down 45%. PS5 hardware spending was down 38% year over year, Xbox Series was down 50%, and Switch was down 53%. PS5 was the best-selling hardware of the month in dollars and units, with the Xbox Series second in hardware spending, and Switch barely second in unit sales.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. for the month of January 2025, based on dollar sales:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li><li>Donkey Kong Country Returns*</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li><li>Sonic Generations</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/what-we-played-roadcraft-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-avowed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Steam Next Fest has been bubbling up behind the scenes all week, with so many game demos and announcements coming that I’m not even really sure when it’s starting. Some demos are out now, others are being run over the weekend, more are only coming out on Monday… but it means that if you have a PC and want to see what’s coming soon, you’ve got plenty to see and play this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of that, Dom and I played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/roadcraft-preview-where-were-going-we-need-to-build-roads/">RoadCraft</a>, a disaster recovery spin-off to the MudRunner series that really makes you feel like a kid in a sandpit. Add to that a game that would be Indiana Jones’ favourite management sim, and that’s my week of games.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> ramping up his gaming again, since his return from the other side of the planet. He enjoyed his time with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/18/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-review/">Stories From Sol: The Gun-Dog</a>, a sci-fi visual novel, but this weekend has Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii booked in for review.</p>
<p>The love hate relationship with Alan Wake 2 has continued for <strong>Jim</strong>, who hit a roadblock with The Lake House DLC – “It solidified my opinion that while great at piecing together weird and compelling stories, Remedy doesn’t know how to pair this with interesting gameplay. It’s a shame as the final DLC is arguably the creepiest, zaniest part of the AW2 package – I just felt burned out after already putting some twenty something hours into the base game. I’ve now moved onto A Plague Tale: Innocence, hoping to wedge in a playthrough before Monster Hunter Wilds launches.”</p>


<p>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope would score highly on a password complexity checker, and it scores highly in <strong>Ade’s</strong> finely tuned “good game” checker as well – “It’s a brilliant TBS game, accessible, fun, and perfect for a quick half hour of gaming.” He’s also had some fun times blast giant bugs in the cities of Helldivers 2 this week.</p>
<p>Bemoaning the difficulty of trawling the PlayStation Store sales of full game gems – all the DLC listings just clutter up the joint, don’t they? – <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a broad spread of games to play this week, including the Tomb Raider 4-6 remakes, Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and Palworld. But he also did the important thing and grabbed a month of Game Pass in order to play Avowed… and about 15 other games on there that he was curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played “the forbidden game” of trying to do his marking and being a dad taxi to his kids. In video games, he finished off Gears 5 and got through most of Hivebusters DLC, but found the game endings have sort of petered out and left too many threads dangling. So he moved on to play Eternal Strands, which has been enjoyable, and is checking out a bunch of demos from Steam Next Fest, with a good few write ups to come.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, as always, been playing Destiny 2.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-january-2025s-top-selling-game-according-to-us-sales-data.1115469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=jbbUZD91 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=AE6L4Gpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>topped Circana's Steam player engagement chart for January.</figcaption></figure><p>Hardware-wise, the PS5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlznlf2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emerged victorious</a> once again in January, beating out the Xbox and Switch in units and dollar sales. Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

<p>As ever, Piscatella's full thread is well worth a look if you want to see some other stats. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq23ems2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check the thread out here</a>.</p>

Fortunately, Epic had a full-blown guide on how to navigate the warnings and restrictions and get it working anyway. It was simple enough, but would probably scare off anyone who has no idea what’s going and just wanted to play a cool <em>Star Wars</em> game on their lunchbreak. Still, it’s progress!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The PGA Tour 2K25 Trophy and Achievement list allows you to be successful on and off the course. Knowing the full list allows you to tee it up high, let it fly, and send your Achievements and Trophies counter into the sky.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> players managed to sneak onto the course through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>. But the whole community will swarm the golfing grounds soon after to see what’s what. They’ll find a varied list requiring you to show golf skills, be an expert orator, and be an online demon. </p>



<p>Let’s cut this warm-up session short and head to the first tee box.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">PGA Tour 2K25 Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An absolute stripe show. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 users must conquer 36 PlayStation Trophies to earn the Platinum. On the other hand, 35 Xbox Achievements are required to do a clean sweep of the available Gamerscore.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It’s the same old story with Trophies and Achievements: PlayStation players get one more intangible accomplishment courtesy of the Platinum Trophy. I’ve no idea why Microsoft still refuses to do something similar, but that’s neither here nor there!</p>



<p>Maybe we need a merger?</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-achievement-amp-trophy">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p><strong>This might be the toughest PGA Tour Trophy List to date</strong>. Usually, you can ride the coattails of the game’s easiest difficulty settings to get everything done. But <a href="https://pgatour.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGA Tour 2K25</a>‘s Achievement and Trophy list requires a certain degree of skill and commitment to online play.</p>



<p>I’m personally not a fan of online trophies and never have been, but it looks like my ball striking needs to be on point if I (or any of us) hope to complete this list.</p>

Bethesda in 2021, seeing the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-wastelanders-review-a-disappointing-ret/1900-6417458/" data-ref-id="1900-6417458">the Wastelanders expansion</a> before exiting the developer. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/">Fallout 76 became even more popular thanks to the Amazon TV series</a>, Gardiner still saw quite the turnaround for the online RPG. "When you put a game out that's that maligned, especially on a team that has had such success, the morale is doubly bad internally," Gardiner said. "So it was my job to make the people who are making the game like the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Gardiner takes pride in Fallout 76, pointing out how "it's a very unique game." The difficult journey with the title also has placed the online RPG as one of his top career achievements. "People always ask, 'What's your favorite game you’ve worked on?' Because [Fallout] 76 was such a difficult game and then it turned around to a successful game, it's actually probably my favorite," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">The game continues to change and evolve. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-biggest-expansion-yet-lets-you-pet-a-very-good-dog/1100-6528198/" data-ref-id="1100-6528198">Fallout 76 saw its biggest expansion yet with the Gleaming Depths update</a> in December, which lets you pet your Bombay Cat or German Shepherd dog. Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">Fallout 76 will let you become a ghoul</a> later this year. Fallout 76 is available on Game Pass. </p>

With a cinematic trailer, developer FunPlus confirmed that DC: Dark Legion will release on March 14.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeD8Ah9K1wg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xeD8Ah9K1wg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pre-registrations are available now on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dc-dark-legion/id6479020757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kingsgroup.dcdly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-developer-says-it-wont-recast-voice-actors-or-use-ai.1115430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>developer Supergiant Games has released a statement responding to a voice actor's recent suggestion that they may be recast owing to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, voice actor Marin Miller, who voices characters like Athena in&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likgdz5k722f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said via Bluesky</a> that followers "may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular" because "the employer refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likglug3322f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Miller made it very clear they were referring to Supergiant, stating that "it would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors". By "flip", Miller presumably means they want Supergiant to put an interim agreement in place to allow them to continue working through the strike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=MpqsTd-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=EK1NZ2eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>voice actor Marin Miller suggested they may be recast during the SAG-AFTRA strike, but Supergiant denies it.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding - albeit indirectly - to Miller's post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky</a>, Supergiant says it hasn't recast any of its&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>actors and that it doesn't intend to do so. The studio also says it "ha[s] respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work" due to the strike.</p>

<p>Supergiant then says that none of its games have been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons", but that its own contracts "offer the strongest AI protections in the industry" and that its games are "intentionally made by human beings", pledging not to use generative AI in the creation of&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>

<p>So far, it doesn't look like Miller has responded to Supergiant on social media. It's possible we may hear from them in the coming days, or that Miller has decided to contact Supergiant directly to continue the dialog.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>itself, development on the game continues apace. Released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, the game sees Princess of the Underworld&nbsp;Melinoë battling the forces of Chronos, the Titan of Time.</p>




<p>Earlier this week, Supergiant released the Warsong Update for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, adding a number of new features to the game. You can check out the full patch notes for that update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. You can check out our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> if you want to know how it stacks up compared to its predecessor.</p>

Surprisingly, she’s telling you the truth about what went down on the island. Granted, whether you opt to help her or not should depend on what type of person you’d like your character to be and what type of playthrough you’re aiming for, but there are definitely positive reasons for freeing this prisoner.</p><p>For starters, she’ll accompany you through the remainder of the island and help you fight off foes that stand in your way. Additionally, a quest you encounter later in Dawnshore (which we won’t spoil here) will go much more smoothly if Ilora has been freed.</p><p>Alternatively, choosing not to free Ilora will result in you having to fight her at the end of the tutorial, as well as the aforementioned quest having a far less peaceful turnout. So, ya know, you could just save yourself the trouble and free her. Or if it’s trouble you’re after, leave her behind bars.</p><figure id="" data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-recommend-id="image://e97bd62baabfc5ba762b95cb3b2caa45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Illora behind bars." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123151"><a id=""></a><strong>How to free Ilora in <em>Avowed</em></strong></h2><p>To free Ilora, climb the box in the corner of the room where she’s being held prisoner.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-peripherals-maker-corsair-clarifies-gta-6-pc-early-2026-release-date-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair has clarified recent comments from one of its executives who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> would release on PC early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a financial call, Corsair Gaming’s VP of finance, Ronald van Veen, said: “Yeah, GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we’ll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early 2026 for PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to spark a number of headlines about Corsair’s apparent insider information on GTA 6’s release window, but a representative of the company told IGN that Ronald van Veen’s comments were speculation, and confirmed Corsair does not have release dates supplied from Rockstar or Take-Two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Take-Two recently committed to launching GTA 6 fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only</a>, despite concern around a potential delay. But what does this mean for the PC version, which remains unannounced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Nvidia's new 50-series graphics cards just aren't as good at running certain older games as previous hardware generations were, some PC gamers have discovered. With its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX, a physics simulation technology that was used in a number of popular titles in the early 2010s.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/rtx_50_series_silently_removed_32bit_physx_support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, one user questioned why PhysX was suddenly turned off by default, or when turned on was forced to run on the CPU--causing major performance issues in games designed for GPU-enhanced PhysX. Responding to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/557200/geforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325/3501715/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the Nvidia forums</a>, the company confirmed that PhysX has effectively been discontinued, due to Nvidia ending support for 32-bit CUDA applications for 50-series graphics cards and future generations. While the end of support for 32-bit CUDA was noted in a <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/~/support-plan-for-32-bit-cuda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brief support article</a>, Nvidia never explicitly mentioned the impact to PhysX, or noted which games might be impacted with the sunsetting of this technology.</p><p>PhysX's GPU-accelerated physics tech was acquired by Nvidia in 2008, and its realistic simulation of moving cloth, liquids, smoke and fog, and shatter particle effects was implemented in a number of popular AAA games of the time--including Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, the Batman: Arkham trilogy, and the first two Metro games.</p><p>While PhysX is now mostly defunct and hasn't been implemented in new games for some time, many gamers were still disappointed to discover it had been discontinued without warning. Users on the Resetera forums have since banded together to create a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of games</a> that will be impacted by the end of PhysX support. The list also notes how well each game will run when using the CPU for PhysX, with users testing each game individually. The full list includes a little under 50 games, but include some popular titles from the period between 2007-2014.</p><p>Previous Nvidia generations, including the 40-, 30-, and 20- series will continue to support 32-bit CUDA applications, meaning gamers who play a lot of older games may be better to stick to an older graphics card for the time being. As is standard for a new generation of graphics cards, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-where-to-buy-new-nvidia-gpu/1100-6528684/" data-ref-id="1100-6528684">new 50-series GPUs</a> are pretty hard to find at the moment, anyway.</p>

                <p>Author George R.R. Martin, who was involved in coming up with some of the lore of From Software's Elden Ring, has commented on the possibility of the game becoming a movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-reveals-there-is-some-talk-about-making-a-movie-out-of-elden-ring-but-theres-one-big-obvious-thing-that-could-limit-his-involvement-with-it-ign-fan-fest-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Martin said he "can't say too much about it," but did indeed confirm that there is "some talk about about making a movie out of Elden Ring."</p><p>In Hollywood, nothing is certain, so no one should get their hopes up to see an Elden Ring movie soon, or ever. Martin acknowledged this, saying "we'll see" if the movie "comes to pass." Even if an Elden Ring movie does materialize, Martin said he's not sure what the extent of his involvement could be. "I don't know," he said, before going on to acknowledge that he's "a few years behind" on his long-awaited Winds of Winter. "So that limits the amount of things that I can do," he said.</p><p>Before this, From Software's own Hidetaka Miyazaki said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-there-is-interest-dev-says/1100-6524511/" data-ref-id="1100-6524511">"some interest" in an Elden Ring movie, but the team wants to be careful about finding the right partner for it. </a></p><p>Back in 2021, Bandai Namco said Elden Ring was already being developed for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">"variety of other areas,"</a> and many took this to mean some kind of film or TV adaptation. Nothing has materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Elden Ring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-rapidly-catching-up-to-dark-souls-sales/1100-6528496/" data-ref-id="1100-6528496">sold nearly 30 million copies</a> to rank as one of the best-selling RPGs ever. Given the immense commercial success of the game, along with Martin's involvement, it's no surprise to hear Hollywood studios might be interested in trying to adapt it. Next up for the game is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Nightreign</a> standalone co-op spinoff, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">launches this May.</a></p><p>It's still early days for a potential Elden Ring movie, and there is no word yet on if it's animated or live-action, or who may direct and star in it. As for confirmed releases, the next two video game movies on tap are A Minecraft Movie (April 4) and Until Dawn (April 25).</p><p>Check out the gallery below to see some of the other video game movies in the works now.</p>
