			<p><span>Standing among the pinnacle of tactical team shooters is Spectre Divide, an upcoming team-based competitive 3v3 tactical shooter that brings some unique twists to the genre. As the inaugural title from Mountaintop Studios, the team has a lot to prove if they want to be recognized alongside Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, and the granddaddy of them all, Counter-Strike. In an exclusive three-hour presentation, we got hands-on with Spectre Divide ahead of its initial reveal.</span></p>
<p><span>As the meta for first-person shooters continues to evolve among a growing number of titles, a team of five or six players pit against each other remains a core tenet of so many of these games. Here, there are still six members of a crew to each side but with a unique twist that hasn’t been properly pulled off in another shooter to date: each player controls two heroes at once.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, there won’t be any split-screen hijinx or transitioning between worlds like The Medium. What Spectre Divide offers is the unique mechanic of Duality, a body-swapping mechanic that allows players to swap into their partner Spectre character at a given time. When not actively controlling the second character, they’ll remain on the lookout and be able to provide real-time feedback when another player approaches. Other than this, the inactive Spectre will remain a sitting duck and can easily be snuck up on by a player who is mindful enough to slowly walk up behind them.</span></p>
<p><span>To balance the act of juggling two bodies at once, the ability to swap into a player’s second Spectre takes time the further apart each character is from the other. Both teammates and enemies alike can see a spark run across the ground as a character's mind shifts into their second body. Players can also redeploy their Spectre in a better vantage spot by throwing out an infinitely reusable puck that draws the Spectre into wherever it lands (also subject to the same timed delay). This mechanic can be used to get a player up onto a vantage spot or across a choke point without needing to run out into the open.</span></p>
<p><span>The concept of Duality makes almost everything in Spectre Divide require two separate halves to create a singular game experience. Players will customize both of their champions individually and in the preview build I got my hands on, things like outfits and cosmetic accessories were limited to only one Spectre at a time. This meant no matching tracksuits or Afros and sunglasses for the pair. The same goes for weapons: aside from the initial buy round, where players are limited to pistols and a few hundred bucks to their name, the in-round shop appears limited to forcing each champion to pick a separate weapon. Granted, this may be a smart quick-pick system at play here and there may be a way to pick which weapon to buy for each warm body manually, but I couldn’t decipher the full breadth of tactics during my few rounds with Spectre Divide. For much of my experience, I settled on a combination of heavy machine guns with a massive clip size for laying down suppressing fire into a choke point accompanied by some semi-automatic sniper rifles for longer-range engagements.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Spectre Divide | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01JX0mOjjKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>True to its Counter-Strike lineage, the core of the team composition lies in the Buy section that begins each round of play. Players start with a limited pool of cash that grows each round based on individual performance, both good and bad, to purchase weapons, armor, and grenades for that specific round. Survive the round, and what you’ve purchased or picked up from the ground carries into the next; die, and you’re back to your starting pistol and whatever cash the Mountaintop gods have bestowed upon you to get back up to speed. From there, players explore the tried-and-true CS-style bomb defusal gameplay, with one side actively trying to blow up one of the two bomb sites in a given stage, while the other is tasked with either taking out the enemy team before they can successfully plant a bomb or defusing it before it can explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to a main weapon and secondary pistol, players will also have three separate abilities to use that are purchased at the start of each round and thrown like grenades. Rather than building out a champion and selecting these abilities from a wide pool of skills, the abilities are instead given out before each round by allying with a particular Sponsor. Each Sponsor in Spectre Divide grants the player the use of three distinctively different skills that all have their tactical uses. The most basic of Sponsors grants players abilities akin to a flash grenade and explosive while some of the more complex Sponsor kits yield surveillance drones, poisoned smoke screens, and a twin-linked health booster that can restore either your health or the health of a teammate you can move your crosshair over to. With eight different Sponsors available at the launch of Spectre Divide, players will have time to explore what trio to run with will be the most advantageous on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide’s gunplay is insanely snappy and responsive to the twitch shooter. What’s unique to the visceral firefights that Mountaintop Studios is bringing to the competition is something they’re coining “true-to-crosshair” accuracy. For ninety-five per cent of the weapons available in Spectre Divide, that initial shot will land exactly where the player is pointing, even while moving. To balance out the one-hit kill sniper rifles, these weapons do have a very brief cooldown period where the accuracy has to recenter itself after moving. This gives semi-automatic weapons that might not fire very quickly a massive initial shot. With the Duality system, losing your active character a second chance by taking over their Spectre, no matter how far across the map they might be.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide has nailed that initial first impression with a unique twist on the tried-and-true 6v6 gunplay, but it’s only a matter of time before we see if this has the potential to be the next great competitive shooter. The concept of Duality will certainly take some practice to get the hang of, and how the Esports community reacts will be a make-it-or-break-it moment for Mountaintop Studios. Spectre Divide is one of the most fascinating new mechanics to the first-person shooter genre since the inclusion of last-man-standing and battle royale modes.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no release date yet, but Mountaintop Studios has already confirmed that its competitive tactical shooter will initially be PC-exclusive.&nbsp;</span></p>

The third-person action-adventure game let players hop into the bounty-hunting boots of Jango Fett aka Boba Fett’s clone dad from <em>Attack of The Clones</em>. It wasn’t great, but was a fun prequel to <em>Episode II.</em> Now, 20 years later, it’s been remastered, improved, and ported to new consoles, and while it looks and plays better than ever, it’s still mostly the same not-great PS2-era action game, but now with a flashlight. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002">The remastered<em> Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></a></span>, out now on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tells the same story as the original version did back in 2002. The game is set about a decade before <em>Attack of the Clones</em> and stars Jango Fett, who is contacted by Count Dooku and told to hunt down a Dark Jedi and criminal leader. If he can take down the leader he’ll collect 5 million credits. What he doesn’t realize is that this is a test orchestrated by Dooku and Palpatine to eliminate a threat to their plans while also finding a strong warrior to be the source of their clone army. </p><p>Needless to say, everything that happens in <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> isn’t canon anymore. But that’s not a dealbreaker. In fact, it’s nice to go back to a time when<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711"><em>Star Wars</em> games got weird</a></span> and wild with the lore because nobody was worried about all of this connecting and knew that series creator George Lucas could, at any time, retcon everything in his next film.</p><h2 id="h1535"><a id=""></a>The same game, for better and mostly worse...</h2><p>Like<em> Bounty Hunter</em>’s unchanged story and cutscenes, its gameplay and levels are mostly left untouched in this new remaster. Instead, developers Aspyr have focused on improving the visuals, the game’s performance, and making it easier to control Jango Fett. And they’ve succeeded. </p><p><em>Bounty Hunter </em>is easier to play now thanks to a modern control scheme and steady framerate. It also looks about as good as a 20-year-old PS2 game can look thanks to improved textures, lighting, and resolution. And yeah, the developers added a flashlight so you can see in some darker areas, which is nice, and time now slows down when using Jango’s scanner, which is very helpful.</p><p>However, it’s time to acknowledge the Bantha in the room: <em>Bounty Hunter</em> was never a great game. In fact, I’d argue that in a lot of ways <em>Bounter Hunter</em> is a bad game. </p><p>The levels feel too big and empty. I often found myself wandering around brown and grey hallways wondering when the next group of baddies would appear and break up the mononity. But enemies aren’t much fun to fight and don’t do much to improve the game. That’s partially because enemy AI is horrible, and also because combat is repetitive. Get ready to shoot groups of the same enemies over and over again as they run at you in a straight line or fall off a ledge and die before they even reach you. </p><p>And while there are other weapons to find in the various missions you go on, those weapons are never good enough to compete with your standard dual blasters which pack a punch, fire as fast as you can pull the trigger, and have infinite ammo. You never need to swap to anything else! </p><p>There is a jetpack in <em>Bounty Hunter,</em> which you get early on in the game, but jetpacking around is more annoying than fun due to how limited it is and a wonky camera that makes it hard to use during a firefight. Worst of all: Bounty hunting in this game is a frustrating chore.</p><h2 id="h1536"><a id=""></a>Being a <em>Star Wars</em> bounty hunter isn’t much fun</h2><p>Every level in <em>Bounty Hunter </em>features a set number of bounty targets that you can optionally hunt down, capture, and collect, either alive or dead. In theory, it’s a neat idea that any NPC or enemy you encounter during a mission could be a wanted criminal. In practice, it sucks so much. </p><p>That’s because to find these targets, you have to scan every enemy and NPC you encounter first, mark any that are targets, and then either kill them or tie them up using a wire gun. If you kill a target before you’ve scanned and marked them, you get nothing. So every fight becomes a slog as you take cover and scan each enemy before fighting them.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Aspyr / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And sure, you can ignore the bounty targets, but then the game is just a so-so third-person shooter with some wonky platforming bits. The bounty hunting part of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is the only thing keeping this game from just becoming a dull journey through boring brown rooms. But collecting bounties is so annoying that I wouldn’t blame anyone for just skipping it all. Do that, though, and you’ll quickly discover how little <em>Bounty Hunter</em> has to offer.<br></p><p>For sure, the remaster of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>is the best way to play this old Jango Fett adventure. The additions and tweaks made to the game are smart and I still like the wacky EU story it tells of Jango hunting down a Dark Jedi. But sadly, this just isn’t a good game. </p><p>In all honesty, I’d have preferred a full remake of <em>Bounty Hunter</em> that improved the combat, levels, and bounty-hunting mechanics. Instead, this is a mediocre 22-year-old PS2-era<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928"><em>Star Wars</em> game</a></span> that only the most nostalgic fans will likely finish and enjoy. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Avowed is being delayed into 2025. That’s according to a new report from The Verge’s Tom Warren.</p>



<p>In his latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notepad </a>newsletter, Warren says that the game is being delayed slightly from Fall 2024 to early 2025. As far as a reason, Warren says it has nothing to do with the game’s development status.</p>



<p>“I understand Avowed is in good shape, this is more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room outside of a very busy period for Xbox Game Pass,”  he said.</p>







<p>As of publishing, Obsidian has yet to make an official announcement of the delay. However, that is expected to come in the near future.</p>



<p>Obsidian was originally slated to release Avowed this fall, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November release date</a> recently being leaked. That date was never ultimately confirmed, leaving this window open for a delay should they need it. </p>



<p>As far as game’s coming to Xbox Game Pass, the biggest is the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The first Call of Duty to come to the service on Game Pass, it seems as though pushing Avowed out of the same launch window will allow it to not become overshadowed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Obsidian and Microsoft for comments on the report. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-delayed-on-last-gen-consoles-and-switch.942327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie sandbox survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on last-gen platforms, so if you've been waiting to check this one out on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch, then you're going to have to wait a little longer, unfortunately.</p>
<p>In a message posted on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games revealed that the game's last-gen release won't be going ahead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date">on August 27th as planned</a>. Instead, the game will be launching on September 17th on those platforms, and the physical versions of the game for those systems will be arriving then as well.</p>
<p>Luckily, the release of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s 1.0 version on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S hasn't been affected by this delay; those versions will still arrive on August 27th. Sadly, the physical versions of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will now be arriving alongside the last-gen version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=_Rtdu0Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=HkrTTF33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook on last-gen platforms.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Fireshine and Pugstorm,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s delay is for the usual reason; to ensure that the game is "the best experience possible at launch" and that players experience the game "at its very best".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, it's a "mining sandbox adventure" in which players team up (or potentially head into the mines solo) in order to gather resources, build bases for themselves, and take on tough enemies.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access in 2022, the game quickly started racking up sales, amassing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days">100,000 within its first two days</a>&nbsp;then hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-250k-within-week">250,000 milestone in just a week</a>. In less than two weeks,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-500k-in-two-weeks">rack up half a million sales</a>, so it's safe to say there are a lot of people awaiting its 1.0 release.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 27th, although you'll have to wait until September 17th for the physical versions. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive on September 17th as well.</p>

In all the matches I’ve played in the game’s beta as the Guardians of the Galaxy leader Star-Lord alongside other heroes and villains in the Marvel universe, I find myself using <em>Overwatch</em>’s terminology. Escort matches are “payloads,” Star-Lord’s “Blaster Barrage” ability is a “Reaper Ult” because both have dual-wielding gunners dancing in gunfire and shooting enemies within a small radius. As new players have joined, my friends and I have relied on <em>Overwatch </em>comparisons as shorthand for how different heroes work. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty unapologetic in inviting those comparisons, but I can’t help but wonder what NetEase’s take on the genre has to offer players if I can’t boot it up without thinking of a different game. Maybe it’s that it doesn’t have ten years of drama and fan in-fighting to shape it yet.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is unapologetic in how much it clearly draws from <em>Overwatch</em>. It has the same objective structures of escorting carts across a map or capturing points, and every hero feels like their kits were made with a handful of <em>Overwatch </em>characters in mind. Star-Lord blends Tracer’s hornet-like hit-and-run style with Soldier: 76’s aimbot ultimate. Rocket Raccoon mixes Baptiste’s healing and damage alternating weapons with an old Orisa ult that powers up every teammate within range of a device he sets down in the middle of a battlefield. Adam Warlock harkens back to Mercy’s original team-reviving resurrection.</p><figure id="" data-id="0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-recommend-id="image://0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-recommend-id="image://0639b7221004a05ce0fe49bb5991afc0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hella casts a magical ability on Doctor Strange." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For some, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> probably embodies the best parts of <em>Overwatch</em>, a lot of which have been patched out and tweaked in the game’s eight-year history. It hasn’t yet been sanded down to prioritize competitive play and headshots, or endlessly reworked and readjusted to avoid annoying metas. Right now, it feels like a chaotic frenzy of high-impact abilities, some incredible teamplay potential, and really endearing, off-the-wall decisions like including Jeff the Land Shark. It doesn’t feel quite as polished as its direct competitor, but maybe that’s what those who are tired of Blizzard’s botched approach might need right now.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch </em>hasn’t lived up to its promise since it was originally revealed 10 years ago, and that has only grown more apparent since the launch of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>in 2022. The sequel has shaved off nearly everything that made it a new game, from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-mode-pve-content-release-date-window-1850442457&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-mode-pve-content-release-date-window-1850442457">gutting the big PvE suite</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">reportedly canceling the promised story mode</a></span>.

If <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lasts as long as <em>Overwatch</em>, parts of it will probably be as unrecognizable in a few years. Right now, it’s a fast-paced, Marvel multiversified version of a game that hasn’t yet lost its way. Whether or not NetEase learns from its inspiration’s mistakes remains to be seen. I’m too much of an <em>Overwatch 2</em> sicko to jump ship, but I can see how <em>Marvel Rivals </em>might appeal to someone who hasn’t pushed a payload in a few years. Hopefully, some competition is enough to get Blizzard to examine its own failings. Perhaps, one day, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will teach <em>Overwatch </em>a thing or two.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thanks to the NFL partnership, gameplay will tie in to live games as they happen.</p><p>The live tie-in element will allow players to make calls during live NFL games "by anticipating big moments or swapping out players from their bench at the right time," Ubisoft's press release says. Players who make the best game-time calls will get major boosts to their fantasy scores, and they can compete online against friends or on a global leaderboard.</p><p>The NFL's VP of video gaming Ed Kiang says the upcoming mobile title is part of the NFL's "dedication to offering non-traditional video gaming experiences for our fans," with NFL Primetime Fantasy marking "the first NFL-licensed mobile game tied to our live games."</p><p>The gameplay is card-based, with players encouraged to build up their collections of NFL player cards, which can then be upgraded through gameplay. The game will feature regular weekly events taking place all throughout the season, right up until the Super Bowl. Players will also be able to form a team with friends in order to compete in a playoff tournament.</p><p>NFL Primetime Fantasy will kick off during the 2024 NFL regular season, with a beta testing period up first, before the worldwide launch in November 2024. Players can register for the beta <a href="http://primetimefantasy.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, and all players who participate in the beta will unlock a free early-access bundle at launch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The dungeon experience in an MMO is sometimes the best part of the game, but grinding to get to the endgame dungeons can be a chore. A new Swedish studio is looking to ease that burden with Fellowship, a new multiplayer online dungeon adventure game--or "MODA"--coming to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Fellowship takes the dungeon-running experience of popular MMOs and streamlines it by letting you group with up to three other players, select a dungeon, and then head right into it. Each player can choose between a healer, tank, or damage-dealer when choosing a character, and each class will have a selection of characters with different kits that allow your group to balance the team to your liking.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuhVdx9K0Fc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe

will offer "quick play" dungeons with 10-15 minute runs per sessions, as well as "ranked" dungeons set to the group's preferences--with difficulty and other modifiers available before jumping in. Dungeons will scale in difficulty as they are completed as well, which means even running the same dungeon multiple times will yield different challenges and rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is being developed by Chief Rebel, a new studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, and it has been in development since 2018. The team includes developers who have worked on top franchises including Diablo, Helldivers, World Of Warcraft, and more.</p><p>Fellowship does not have an official release window as of this reveal, but Chief Rebel will be holding a closed alpha test session August 15-20 on PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am getting absolutely stomped in <a href="http://playspectre.com/"><em>Spectre Divide</em></a>, the just-revealed 3-on-3 online shooter from a new game studio staffed by talent from Oculus VR, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Halo Infinite, </em>and more. I am not good at this free-to-play PC game. But I can’t stop thinking about how I might <em>get</em> good — by intelligently swapping between two bodies to outmaneuver my enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>If only I’d placed my doppelganger <em>here</em> instead of <em>there</em>, I could’ve had my own back. What if I had teleported my clone behind enemy lines to flank them while I drew their attention elsewhere? Maybe if I’d planted the bomb with one body while camping that door with the other, I’d have caught them unawares?&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve never played a shooter like this before — even if, at first, it looks and feels an awful lot like <em>Valorant</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been four years since Mountaintop Studios started building its 70-person fully remote team, raising $60 million and attracting a number of popular streamers along the way. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365355/shroud-return-twitch-500-thousand-viewers-streaming-valorant">Twitch star Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek</a> became the company’s lead gameplay adviser for the past year or so, though Mountaintop won’t say if he’s also committed to streaming it.) </p><p>After that wait, I was initially disappointed to see it might just be another hero shooter with anime-inspired graphics like <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>.&nbsp;But not for long, because Mountaintop’s first game doesn’t actually have any heroes or <em>Valorant</em>’s “I never knew what hit me and now I’m sitting out the round” Ultimates. Instead, <em>Spectre Divide </em>gives you two bodies, so, at a minimum, you get a second chance after your first gets wiped out. </p><p>“One big thing we’ve solved in tac shooters is sitting and watching,” says director Lee Horn.</p><div><figcaption><em>All three human players stack up for a push — while our other bodies hang back.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Intriguingly, there’s an in-universe explanation for the twin bodies: nobody is dying in this game. You’re competing in Santai, a <em>relatively</em> bloodless bloodsport where a former military technology called Duality lets players inhabit a pair of empty spectre avatars — “one mind, two bodies,” Mountaintop likes to say. </p><p>The game is set in a city called Breakwater, where the sport is popular enough that corporate sponsors have gotten involved, contributing gear (grenades, echolocation pings, vision blockers, traps, and more) that take the place of the abilities you’d have in a hero shooter. Here’s a quick gallery of the options on day one:</p><p>Each round, you pick your sponsor, decide how much cash to spend on weapons, armor, and abilities, and either attack or defend in the bomb defusal mode that <em>Counter-Strike</em> popularized nearly 25 years ago. Only now, you’ve got two bodies per person.</p><p>Frankly, it’s a lot for a newbie to keep track of. You’re always temporarily leaving one of your two bodies behind, and it’s not always easy to tell what’s happening back there. You do get a “Spectre Warning” Spidey-sense if your distant self hears enemy footsteps, but it can be a huge risk to go check. When I quickly teleported back to help my <em>second</em> self, it meant leaving my <em>first</em> self out in the open to get destroyed. When I spent time safely squirreling away my first self, I was often too late to save my second.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>One of the rare rounds where I was directly responsible for victory.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But when you get it right, and properly coordinate with your human teammates and their own other selves, the plays feel great. You can have your entire team cover bomb site A and bomb site B simultaneously by splitting your forces, teleporting to whichever set of bodies is under attack. You can fake an attack at one bomb site, then switch to the other without running across the entire map — just warp into your other body, then throw the “puck” that gradually teleports your first body along for the ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The map helps with both strategy and setup: at the beginning of a map, you can immediately teleport your two bodies anywhere in the starting area and angle them as you’d like.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>You can rush with all six spectres, reinforcing yourselves by teleporting your spectre forward as you press the attack. (My favorite piece of gear so far is the Dual Amp, which lets me rush down foes by teleporting my clone to my location and improving its rate of fire simultaneously.) But if foes know you’re coming, they can reinforce themselves the same way. This is a game where a player can camp and actively attack you at the same time, so be prepared for that.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also need to prepare for foes who can head-shot you instantly without skipping a beat or pump nearly every single bullet they fire into you should their headshot miss. One of the biggest ways this game is <em>not</em> like <em>Valorant</em> is that aimed shots are always accurate. If you click a mouse while the targeting reticle is on a head, that’s where the shot will land.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>How to aim.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Mountaintop</cite></p></div><p>While hip fire is not accurate beyond close range, the pattern that bullets will spray when you’re aiming down the sights is almost always the same, making it critical to memorize the spray pattern of your weapon and move your mouse accordingly if you want to win face-to-face firefights.</p><p>While this might sound great to competitive gamers, I don’t have time to maintain that skill; even as a young adult, the day I personally stopped playing <em>Counter-Strike</em> was the day I tired of getting instantly head-shot by the damn AK.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Like </em>Counter-Strike<em>, the game has an AWP — only here, it’s called the Prototype-OP. It’s a satisfying, booming one-hit kill that keeps the enemy team’s head down... or provokes them to kill you and steal it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>That said, <em>Spectre</em>’s dual bodies and gadgets mean I don’t always have to fight head-to-head. I can flank, provide covering fire, heal, shield, distract, and snipe with my own spectre to cover me. There’s value in <em>not</em> rushing in, particularly when a round is already lost: saved weapons and armor carry forward to the next round if you don’t die. A team that buys decent weapons every round won’t be able to afford devastating ones later if they keep getting gunned down (or bombed) in the process.</p><p><em>Spectre Divide</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but the UE4 game already feels fairly polished. The game ran incredibly smoothly on my midrange PC (with RTX 3060 Ti graphics), and my colleague Tom Warren said it barely hit his GPU at all. It currently uses BattlEye anticheat tech, though the company says that’s just the starting point. </p><div><figcaption><em>Can’t buy everything... though you can request teammates buy it for you if they’ve got extra cash.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It’s only currently planned for PC, with no controller or console plans yet — and Mountaintop won’t necessarily allow Steam Deck to join. “Steam Deck is a concern as a cheating vector, and I think our anti-cheat systems may block it right now,” Mountaintop CEO and cofounder Nate Mitchell tells me.</p><p>The game will launch with four maps, with additional ones coming in seasonal updates, and only the single bomb defusal game mode to start. There also aren’t immediate plans to add more weapons since Mountaintop wants to “let the meta settle” and do a balance pass first.&nbsp;</p><p>Mountaintop will be publishing the game itself on Steam, and it’ll be free to play, funded by the cosmetic weapon skins and character customization parts you can buy, plus new packages of “sponsor” equipment you can also get by grinding. The company says they’ll be priced similarly to other games. Weapons will be free: “We’re committed to the fact that Spectre Divide won’t be pay-to-win,” the company writes.</p><p>Mountaintop says <em>Spectre Divide</em> will be available for the public to play in closed beta soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
According to certain Terran lore, God created the universe in seven days. Well, I got up this morning and made a small suburban village with a hospital, school, police station <em>and</em> a cafe in the space of 20 minutes. This is the backwater burg of Edwitherington. Population: 8 - one for every non-residential building in town. Major imports: ornamental lampposts, because I like to cultivate an old-timey mood. Major exports: traffic jams, because I've laid out my village in the form of a small crescent leading back to the freeway, which means that there are two traffic light junctions about 100 metres apart. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That freeway used to be all but traffic-free, a spotless tarmac embroidery for a whistling and seething expanse of woodland. Cars? They were practically fairytales, glimpsed once in a blue moon. Thanks to my abortive town-planning efforts, the freeway has congealed into a diabolical map-length sardine can of isometric roadsters straining to move past each other. Meanwhile, the eight residents of Edwitherington drift from one hauntingly empty municipal building to the next. Please stay away from the hospital: I forgot to give the bathrooms doors, and the beds are engulfed in shrubbery.
</p>
<p>
The game I'm playing is <a href="https://yesbox.itch.io/metropolis1998">the demo for Metropolis 1998</a>, and it's not nearly as hellish as I've just made it sound. It's a colourful throwback city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> with lots of deft little touches, of which the most important is probably being able to see and tinker with interior layouts. You can choose from ready-made offices, groceries and so on, but the true craftsperson will of course want to fashion a bespoke building and, as the case may be, turn the game into a Simmish penal colony.
</p>
<p>
Solo developer YesBox (who is collaborating with two external pixel artists) is at pains to note that "this is not a real game yet" and that it only has "a sliver of game loop". As of June, the demo only really lets you place and mess with a small number of buildings, with pops buying homes and going to work on weekdays, but no economy to speak of. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities Skylines</a> it ain't. But the prototype has bags of charm, and YesBox has <a href="https://yesboxstudios.com/roadmap/">Grand Designs indeed</a>. These include more developed inner lives for your citizens (including a choice of religion), town councils with roles such as head of education and chief firefighter, celebrity visits and parades, individual citizen bank accounts, and disasters such as hurricanes and ruinous monopolies.</p>
<p>Post-1.0-version aspirations include a zombie apocalypse button, visible crime, and a Sims-like mode that lets you live in the dysfunctional suburban excrescence you've hacked together from mismatching wallpaper patterns. Perhaps that should be every town architect's final punishment, as in <a href="https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/">certain Dwarf Fortress Let's Plays</a>. If there's any justice in the universe, I'll be taking up residence in Edwitherington soon. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metropolis-1998">Metropolis 1998</a> has been in development since November 2021, and there's no final release date yet.

            <p>After teasing us all earlier in the year with a playful trailer featuring a vibrating cardboard box, the Jackbox team has today lifted the lid on its upcoming, risqué themed Naughty Pack.</p>
<p>The Naughty Pack, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-is-getting-risque-with-adults-only-naughty-pack">you may recall</a>, will comprise three "provocative" games, which the Jackbox team promises will "deliver on laughter, wit, and a touch of irreverence".</p>

<p>We now know what these three games are, and one of them wants us to answer the ever important question: "Which of these meats most wants to be called daddy?" Well, I say!</p>
<p>Kicking things off, there's Fakin' It All Night Long, which is a social deduction game. Dirty Drawful, meanwhile, is a drawing and guessing game. Lastly, Let Me Finish is a saucy debate-style game. </p>
<p>
The first two of the pack's games will be somewhat familiar for those who have played Jackbox games before, as they are basically Fakin' it and Drawful but with a mature twist.</p>

</figure>
<p>Here is a rundown of each of the Naughty Pack's three games:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fakin' It All Night Long:</strong> Fakin' It returns and this time we're putting it all out there. Everyone gets a secret task except the Faker, who tries to blend in. Find out which of your friends is the best liar... and SO much more! Featuring new categories and a brand new "remote play" mode.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dirty Drawful:</strong> It's Drawful, but dirty... It's Dirty Drawful. We've taken the Drawful that you love and added spicy prompts to ensure your drawings are both terrible and titillating. We also may have added an "undo" button for this one, but don't tell anyone.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Let Me Finish:</strong> Let Me Finish is Jackbox's new presentation game that examines life's serious questions like, "Where is the mailbox's butt?" or "How does this avocado get aroused?" Everyone gets a chance to speak their mind but will others pick up what you're putting down?</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above games supports between three and eight players. </p>
<p>The Jackbox Naughty Pack is set to release across platforms this September, with a retail price of $21.69/€21.69 (I can only assume those 69s were intentional, given the pack's theme). At the time of writing, we are still awaiting UK pricing.</p>
<p>If you are interested in picking up the Jackbox Naughty Pack, you can add it to your Steam wishlists now. You can also check out the trailer for Jackbox's Naughty Pack via the video below.</p>

<p>In the meantime while we wait for this more debauched version of Jackbox (although, who are we kidding, we all already made Jackbox games pretty filthy anyway), there is now an easier way to buy and play the mini-games, thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-games-new-megapicker-launcher-currently-gives-you-drawful-2-free">brand's new Megapicker launcher</a>.</p>
<p>This free launcher is available now on Steam, and as the name suggests, it acts as a central hub for players to pick and choose their Jackbox mini-games from.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players are now able to unlock the Tesla Cybertruck, though have found it has arrived with some issues - not unlike its real-world equivalent.
</p>
<p>
Players report that using the digital version of Elon Musk's motor breaks various in-game items, effectively penalising them for attempting to drive the Cybertruck themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Videos uploaded by Fortnite fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egqhzh/cybertruck_breaks_nitro_fists_ships_in_bottles/">reddit</a> show players unable to use the meta-dominating Nitro Fists, as well as the current Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration item Ship in a Bottle, after driving a Cybertruck. 
</p>
<p>
Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1eh2p6x/in_other_news_the_cyber_truck_is_immune_to_the/">reported</a> issue with the Cybertruck is that it appears immune to the Tow Hook, a grappling hook weapon that should allow players to latch on to any vehicle. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1eh2p6x/in_other_news_the_cyber_truck_is_immune_to_the/">report</a> that using the Cybertruck gives an advantage when trying to eliminate stowaway players, versus other vehicles. This is the opposite of an issue with premium paid-for car skins offering more protection for stowaways that Epic Games has previously said it would fix.
</p>
<p>
The Tesla Cybertruck has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite">controversial addition to Fortnite</a>, with some of the game's own developers saying they would destroy the vehicle on sight if spotted in-game. 
</p>
<p>
"Reminder that voting with your wallet works and sentiment on social media is a tangible factor," one Fortnite developer said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-own-developers-dont-seem-thrilled-at-elon-musks-cybertruck-being-added-to-the-game">distancing themselves from the addition of the car</a> closely associated with Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>In real-life, the Cybertruck has become notorious for its various issues, including safety concerns, malfunctions, and bits just generally falling off, leading to repeated recalls.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With this premise it’s no surprise that Gerighty also mentions <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-review-feel-good-outlaws-5546463&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-review-feel-good-outlaws-5546463"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a></span> as an inspiration, but <em>Tsushima</em>’s role as a touchstone for <em>Outlaws </em>is particularly fascinating to dig into. </p><p>Since its release in 2020, Insomniac’s samurai epic has received critical and public acclaim, with many calling it one of the best riffs on the Ubisoft-style open-world RPG. If you’ve played<em> Ghost of Tsushima,</em> you probably recognized how years of<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>inspired the PlayStation epic, to the point that many have called it the best <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game…not made by Ubisoft, that is. Here we have a Ubisoft RPG taking inspiration from a game that itself is clearly inspired by Ubisoft RPGs of the past. There’s some kind of recursive loop of iterative game design going on here, with core concepts and gameplay fundamentals going from Ubisoft to Sony and now back to Ubisoft. </p><p>In our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928">hands-on preview</a></span> of the game, we noted that while it relies heavily on some signature Ubisoft systems that feel quite dated, <em>Outlaws</em> still shines thanks to its beautiful world and cast of characters, elements which Geraghty explicitly mentioned as being influenced by <em>Ghost of Tsushima.</em> Hopefully looking outside of Ubisoft for inspiration will pay off for <em>Outlaws</em> when it releases on August 30.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These tips will help you efficiently prepare to take on the Seethe: the enemies of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>.</p><h2 id="h7726"><a id="villagers"></a>Focus on villagers and defilements during the day</h2><p>While most stages are finished by the protagonist Soh carving a spirit path for the maiden Yoshiro, this won’t be your top priority in preparing. There’s plenty to do during the day and the latter stages are even more complex, but your primary focus will be on rescuing villagers and purifying the hanging defilements to earn crystals. Aim to complete these to ensure that you’re combat-ready once the Seethe come at night.</p><h2 id="h7727"><a id=""></a>Be mindful of where you leave Yoshiro</h2><p>Slain villagers can be rescued again after the night ends and Soh will enter a temporary spirit state if their health is depleted. These luxuries aren’t offered to Yoshiro though, who can trigger a game over if she takes too much damage. What makes her more fragile is that she essentially becomes a sitting duck after the sun sets.</p><p>You’ll need to be wary of where she’ll be at night. If she’s expected to start the night in the open with lots of paths, consider having her stop earlier in a safer area. <strong>Ideal spots will be behind a repaired barrier or within a ward, the latter of which can damage enemies.</strong> It’s okay to take your time since she won’t be able to cross a stage in one go anyway.</p><h2 id="h7728"><a id="carpenter"></a>Keep the Carpenter busy</h2><p>Early on you’ll meet the Carpenter NPC, who can be ordered to repair various contraptions on a stage during the day. Whether it’s a barrier to stall the Seethe’s advance or a platform for archers, fixing up contraptions will make a huge difference in battle.</p><p><strong>Have this NPC repair things as often as possible.</strong> It’s an absolute waste to not use an NPC that doesn’t count as a villager and who’s only available during the day. Any progress they make is also saved for the next day, so don’t hesitate to order them to work on something you know they might not finish before nightfall.</p><h2 id="h7729"><a id="thief"></a>Reassign your Thieves before night</h2><figure id="" data-id="0b354b08b1b2e41fb9d19e186f889ec7" data-recommend-id="image://0b354b08b1b2e41fb9d19e186f889ec7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A thief unearths a chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A thief unearths a chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b354b08b1b2e41fb9d19e186f889ec7" data-recommend-id="image://0b354b08b1b2e41fb9d19e186f889ec7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A thief unearths a chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Thief is a fantastic utility role that you’ll acquire after a handful of stages. It’s the only NPC that can dig up the half-buried chests you may have noticed before. Their only drawback is that they won’t participate in battle against the Seethe at night.</p><p>Changing their roles as evil spirits attack isn’t the greatest time, which is why I do it right before the sun sets. If you’re unsure whether they seem worth the numerous crystals to change their role twice, I can assure you they are. There’s a good chance a chest they dig up will have a ton of crystals if not Musubi. </p><h2 id="h7730"><a id=""></a>Purify animals for rations</h2><p>You’re bound to come across animals covered in defilement during the day. They’ll flee as you approach and won’t stop until they’re far away. While they might seem like a waste of time to deal with, hitting some can be a big help. <strong>Your weapons might be able to slay evil spirits and break pots, but attacking a defiled animal will simply purify it and drop a ration.</strong> Consider helping these creatures out with a good whack if you or the villagers need to recover health.</p><h2 id="h7731"><a id="respec"></a>Respec your upgrades whenever you want</h2><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>is just as much a strategy game as it is an action one. A lot goes into preparing for new stages, including when you upgrade your villagers at your bases. The good news about this mechanic however is that your choices don’t have to be permanent.</p><p>Upgrading requires the less-than-common Musubi resource, but <strong>you can undo every upgrade you’ve made if you want</strong>. That means if you’re about to tackle a stage that doesn’t benefit a particular villager role (such as a Thief in a boss stage), it’s best to remove the applied Musubi and use it on a more relevant role instead.</p><h2 id="h7732"><a id="bonus"></a>Come back for bonus objectives later</h2><p>The desire to immediately replay a level just to knock out the new bonus objectives is relatable. False confidence is a hell of a thing when you’re fresh off beating a stage and realize you can earn rewards such as Musubi or Mazo Talismans. But <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is not a game you typically want to do that with.</p><p>Destroying all the pots on a stage is certainly doable, but defeating a boss under a certain time or completing a stage without using rations is incredibly easier after you’ve unlocked more things. <strong>Come back after you’ve amassed more upgrades and villager roles to finish these objectives with ease.</strong></p><h2 id="h7733"><a id="repairs"></a>Visit your bases and issue repairs</h2><figure id="" data-id="deb720e03cd88327fdbca3ad26b4d873" data-recommend-id="image://deb720e03cd88327fdbca3ad26b4d873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a village being repaired." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a village being repaired." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deb720e03cd88327fdbca3ad26b4d873" data-recommend-id="image://deb720e03cd88327fdbca3ad26b4d873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a village being repaired." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Successfully purifying a non-boss stage will turn part of it into a base for the local villagers. Outside of the various options available inside Yoshiro’s tent, you can walk around and request help in repairing the broken-down areas of the stage. Rewards include collectibles (Sweets and Ema Plaques respectively) in addition to Musubi. <strong>Completing every repair for a base will increase the maximum limit for your crystals and occasionally your rations.</strong></p><p>Keep in mind that progress is only made on these by completing stages. If you want the rewards for a repair and don’t want to wait to complete the latter lengthy stages, you can rush through them by tackling an earlier boss stage.</p><h2 id="h7734"><a id="crystals"></a>Don’t Hoard Your Crystals and Rations</h2><p>The limit for crystals and rations I mentioned earlier only applies outside of the stages themselves. You can accumulate and use as much as you want during a level, <strong>but any excess is lost once the stage is completed</strong>. It’s a waste to be overly frugal with these—keep everyone healthy and feel free to re-assign any villager roles.</p><h2 id="h7735"><a id="command"></a>Take a breather in the Command menu</h2><p>Every stage in this game introduces new mechanics, enemies, and level designs, resulting in a rising complexity. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed as the maps and villagers you have to watch over increase in size.</p><p>I recommend taking small breaks by entering the Command menu. The Pause menu might be a more comfortable way to take a break, but the Command menu will let you view your immediate surroundings for as long as you want and see the health of every villager.</p><h2 id="h7736"><a id="ascetic"></a>Don’t sleep on the Ascetic Role</h2><figure id="" data-id="18583c47cba08451de09caa3678f4099" data-recommend-id="image://18583c47cba08451de09caa3678f4099" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ascetic villager stands at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ascetic villager stands at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18583c47cba08451de09caa3678f4099" data-recommend-id="image://18583c47cba08451de09caa3678f4099" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ascetic villager stands at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Defeating the second boss will reward you with the option to assign the Ascetic Role to villagers. It’s a pretty unique villager type since it acts as more of a de-buffer. They’ll summon a barrier around themselves that slows down any enemies that pass through it. <strong>This ability works on common enemies and bosses alike, making it much easier to inflict damage between their attacks.</strong></p><p>Keep upgrading Ascetics and the barrier will become more effective across a larger area. The final upgrade allows the barrier to cause damage and lower enemy defense. Speaking from personal experience, the Ascetic has villager has saved my ass more than anyone else and rightfully earned a mainstay spot for most stages. Keep them around and you’ll be set.</p><h2 id="h7737"><a id="upgradesoh"></a>Upgrade Soh</h2><p>Partway through you’ll become able to upgrade Soh with Musubi too. This results in the balancing act of where to spend them all the more tricky. That being said, I do recommend putting a considerable amount of Musubi towards Soh.</p><p>You’ll gain access to a variety of combat-oriented skills such as new weapons (including ranged arrows!) and attacks, as well as additional Mazo Talismans and Tsuba Guards to equip. The command screen can also gain a few new convenient options such as being able to rally multiple villagers to one location or ordering Yoshiro from anywhere on the map.</p><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is a challenging game, but taking advantage of its many mechanics to find the right strategies is the key to venturing further down the mountain.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new trailer today, Respawn teased the new E-District map coming to Apex Legends in “Shockwave” ahead of its release on August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/shockwave-game-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA site</a> explains the new E-District map is “built for verticality,” and describes it as a “densely packed urban oasis.” Respawn will reveal a full overview of E-District tomorrow on August 2, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer also teases Trios Revival, which introduces another way for teammates to respawn without banners and beacons. </p>



<p>Instead, players will automatically respawn based on a timer, which changes according to gameplay. Each death increases the timer, but teammates can speed it up by dealing damage and more.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Shockwave Gameplay Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQkYabjDIrM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new season will also introduce Akimbo, allowing players to dual-wield either two P2020s or two Mozambiques. </p>



<p>Shockwave also adds a new Bot Royale mode and Welcome Pass, making it easier for newcomers to join Apex Legends.</p>



<p>Apex Legends recently faced intense fan backlash over its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass overhaul</a>, which removed the option to use in-game currency. Players quickly review-bombed the game, drawing concern for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-esports-world-cup-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eSports World Cup event</a>.</p>



<p>However, Respawn partly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-back-tracks-on-battle-pass-pricing-but-only-a-little/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed its decision</a>, admitting that “we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better — that’s on us.”</p>



<p>This may help renew some interest in the game, and today’s trailer does emphasize revivals and new energy. However, many fans still took the Shockwave trailer as an opportunity to joke about pricing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-most-outrageous-moments.942255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-most-outrageous-moments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Borderlands is a series known for its flair for the unhinged. But in reflecting on the looter-shooter’s long, gorey, and downright wrong history, there are several moments that stand out even within a series where derangement is the status quo. Twelve of them, in fact. Here’s Borderlands’ most outrageous moments, in order of ascending wildness.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/party-1722439489712.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>12. Attending Claptrap’s Birthday Party (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Claptrap is a pretty divisive character in the Borderlands community. Some find him hilarious, while others just think he’s annoying (they’re both right). But regardless of where you stand on his comedy chops, it’s pretty undeniable that he’s one of the most depressing characters to spend time with. The wheeled trashcan often goes out of his way to draw out awkward moments and instigate a full-body cringe in the nearest vault hunter.</p><p>Few such moments are more hilariously depressing than when a side quest in Borderlands 2 called “Claptrap’s Birthday Bash” has you spending time with the dorky little robot while organizing his birthday party. After extending invitations to everyone in Sanctuary, attendance is predictably dismal and you’re forced to stand around for several minutes in awkward silence. We’ve all been to a birthday party like this one before, right? Pure pain.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/6-marcus-aggressively-denis-customer-request-for-a-refund-in-borderlands-2-mp4-00-00-25-05-still001-1722343181778.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>11. Marcus Aggressively Denies Request for a Refund (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Everyone’s favorite entrepreneur, firearm salesman, and series narrator, Marcus, is best-known for his love of cold hard cash and violent disagreement with anyone who tries to get in the way of him and his quest for moolah. His introduction video from Borderlands 2 perfectly demonstrates this when he proves his guns work just fine and refuses a refund by shooting a customer in the knee with said "faulty" weapon.</p><p>The iconic line “Looks like it works to me” lives rent free in my head every time I see that sadistic businessman’s grin, and perfectly encapsulates the greedy capitalist in his purest form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/8-rhys-and-vaughn-bro-down-hard-in-tales-from-the-borderlands-mp4-00-06-35-35-still001-1722342974742.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>10. Rhys and Vaughn Bro Down Hard (Tales from the Borderlands)</h2><p>One of the best parts of Telltale Games’ Tales from the Borderlands is how it leans on its unreliable narrators to surprise the player in interesting ways. My favorite example of this is in Episode 2 “Atlas Mugged” when a moment between Rhys and Vaughn starts feeling very odd. They suddenly start overusing “bro” in their dialogue, begin fist-bumping one another, then go cross-eyed and lose their minds... before the scene cuts to Fiona, who reveals she made it all up. If I hadn’t already been endeared to this lovable cast of misfits by the second episode, this moment solidified my love for them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/7-claptrap-is-bested-by-stairs-in-borderlands-2-mp4-00-13-06-02-still001-1722343002875.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>9. Claptrap is Bested by Stairs (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Probably the best Claptrap moment in all of Borderlands comes during the climax of Borderlands 2 as the vault hunters begin their final assault against the vile Handsome Jack. After an epic battle sequence and an inspiring speech delivered from our robot friend, Claptrap is suddenly confronted by a foe too great for him to overcome: a flight of stairs. The wheelbound little guy has no way of navigating such an incline. </p><p>Naturally, he has to stay behind while the vault hunters go on to face off against the big bad. And we thank those stairs too, because spending more time with Claptrap probably would have thrown a wet blanket on a pretty awesome conclusion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/10-finding-the-thirsty-shotgun-in-the-pre-sequel-mp4-00-00-33-09-still001-1722342688740.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>8. Finding the Thirsty Shotgun (Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel)</h2><p>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel sometimes gets a bad rap for its comedy chops, but some of its gags stand out among its series peers. My personal favorite is a side quest called “Another Pickle” that rewards the player with a sentient Scav shotgun called Boganella. The weapon’s special effect, called “Rack off ya dag!” increases the scattershot’s potency and also makes it talk every time you fire or reload it.</p><p>And to our surprise, dear old Boganella seems to only have one thing on her mind, as she shouts “get in there,” “jam another in me,” and much more explicit phrases I dare not repeat. This thirsty shotgun easily goes down as one of the most unique and memorable weapons ever to appear in a video game. </p><p>Also, since The Pre-Sequel was made by 2K's now-defunct Australian studio, there’s a little easter egg in there for those familiar with local slang. The name “Boganella” is a reference to the Australian and New Zealand term “bogan”, which describes "an uncouth or unsophisticated person regarded as being of low social status," according to Oxford Languages. Naturally, the weapon’s constant cursing and vile charm perfectly encapsulates that stereotype.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/11-torque-blows-up-the-ocean-mp4-00-01-03-01-still001-1722342660048.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>7. Mr. Torgue Blows Up the Ocean (Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands)</h2><p>Mr. Torgue was an instant hit the moment he first showed his mustachioed face and glistening muscles in the Borderlands 2 DLC, Mr. Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage. Over time, the character became more and more of a mainstay to the series, including in the Borderlands spinoff, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. </p><p>Of all the moments for which Mr. Torgue’s high-octane energy and foul mouth is known, though, none strike me as being quite as wild as that time he cast “Magic <em>bonk-ing</em> Missile” and launched a dozen nuclear warheads that blew up the entire ocean. Not only do we get a memorable rock concert beforehand, but this explosion has a massive impact on the rest of the game, as you’re then forced to walk through the now-empty ocean bed to get from one area to the next. Thanks a lot, Mr. Torgue.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/2-handsome-jack-kills-bloodwing-in-borderlands-2-mp4-00-18-01-21-still001-1722343049378.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>6. Handsome Jack Kills Bloodwing (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Handsome Jack is without question the best bad guy the Borderlands series has ever had (and one of my favorite gaming villains in general), and the reason he’s such a strong antagonist is the ease with which he wears his sadistic nature. Instead of being a maniacal edgelord, he pulls off his sociopathic ways with the tone and pageantry of a game show host telling the audience to look under their chairs for his latest work of deviousness.</p><p>One moment that always stands out to me is when he does the unthinkable and kills off Mordecai’s beloved bird companion, Bloodwing, in the most disrespectful way imaginable. Not only does Handsome Jack kidnap the winged friend and use her to taunt the vault hunters, but he also mutates her with slag to turn her into one of the story’s main boss fights. As he toys with the player and prepares to cut Bloodwing’s life short, he recounts all the damage elements found in the Borderlands series and leaves out just one: explosive, before making the bird’s head pop like a balloon. I still occasionally find myself shouting “EXPLOSIIIIIVE” to this very day.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/4-face-mcshooty-demans-you-to-shoot-him-in-the-face-mp4-00-00-43-08-still001-1722343066586.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>5. Face McShooty Requests a Bullet to the Face (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>You knew this one was going to make the list, right? Yes, as you probably suspected, the infamous two-second-long side quest where a throwaway character named Face McShooty demands you shoot him in the face absolutely belongs on the list. It perfectly encapsulates the silly, irreverent tone which sets Borderlands apart from other looter shooters.</p><p>Farewell, Face McShooty! We didn’t know you well, but we know enough to conclude you died doing what you loved: getting shot in the face. Rest in peace, dear friend.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/3-butt-sallion-one-mp4-00-00-12-01-still001-1722343084844.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>4. Throwaway Gag, Butt Stallion, Becomes Full Blown Character (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Butt Stallion, Handsome Jack’s horse made entirely of diamonds, was first mentioned in the opening moments of Borderlands 2 as a way for the antagonist to show himself to be the ritzy, detached one-percenter that he is. But you may not know that Borderlands 2 writer Anthony Burch has said in interviews that the gag was actually added last-minute and many on Gearbox team didn’t even know of its existence until the game was in the hands of the public.</p><p>This makes it all the more crazy that, after the fabled steed became a hit with fans, the horse was added to the game as a principle character, first in the Borderlands 2 DLC Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep, then in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. Oh, Butt Stallion, may your reign last one thousand years, you glorious diamond pony.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/5-handsome-jack-tells-his-spoon-story-mp4-00-36-19-09-still001-1722343107971.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>3. Handsome Jack Tells His Spoon Story (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Okay, okay. This will be the final Handsome Jack-focused moment. I promise! But it’s hard to make a list of best moments from Borderlands without talking about one of the most memorable monologues the series has. Partway through the Borderlands 2 story, Handsome Jack chimes in over the radio to lament how tenacious you are, before launching into a monologue that so perfectly showcases his psychopathy, his horrid view of the world, and somehow makes all that genuinely funny with his almost scary levels of charm. The story involves a raided village, a man who tries to attack Handsome Jack with a spoon, and Jack’s violent response that follows, all of which is presented as a hilarious joke. </p><p>He ends his tale by telling you the moral of the story, which is honestly the most deep and meaningful part of it all – really makes you think. It’s also the moral of this article, dear reader.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/9-the-legendary-finger-gun-fight-in-tales-from-the-borderlands-mp4-00-01-57-15-still001-1722343138596.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>2. The Legendary Finger Gun Fight (Tales from the Borderlands)</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most shocking and bizarre sequences in Borderlands history, I still can’t really tell you how or why this Tales from the Borderlands combat encounter exists. In Episode 4: Escape Plan Bravo, Rhys and Vaughn take on a whole army of accountants in a make-believe game of finger guns. It’s truly the stuff of legends.</p><p>I didn’t know that, in a world where the wildest weapons are easily accessible, I would be more entertained by the simplest of children’s games. But seriously, this is up there with the best things Borderlands has ever given to the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/stairs-1722439629339.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>1. Nakayama Is Fatally Bested by Stairs (Borderlands 2)</h2><p>Borderlands really seems to have a thing with stairs, as Claptrap isn’t the only one being given trouble by these right angles. In Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock’s Big Game Hunt, we learn a lot more about the obsessive lackey of Handsome Jack, Professor Nakayam, who hopes to seek revenge on the vault hunters who cut his idol’s time short. But after throwing all manner of vicious beast in our path to no avail, he has no choice but to face us himself. The boss fight that would have followed never happens though, as the dear professor trips and falls down some stairs, dying instantly.</p><p>In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel we become better acquainted with Nakayama, his obsession for his boss, and his incompetence that ultimately results in his clumsy demise. But he’ll be best remembered in the same breath as Rick the Door Technician from Star Wars: Jedi Survivor – a gag boss who never stood a chance.</p><p>What are your favorite Borderlands moments?

Both newcomers and seasoned veterans will discover they can get the dungeon experience they want from the start, as they can choose to play Quick Play Dungeons that offer more casual 10 to 15-minute dungeon runs or Ranked Dungeons that offer a more competitive experience as they allow players to scale the dungeon difficulty to their liking, choose from various dungeon modifiers, and more.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gather Your Perfect Team</strong> – Play alongside your friends in teams with four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a> in a rich, fantasy world full of challenging enemies and exciting rewards.

Enemy skills grow as difficulty increases and additional modifiers continue to challenge players as they grow and improve.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“We’re very excited to introduce <em>Fellowship</em>, a passion project that we’ve been working on for a long time since we formed Chief Rebel,” said Chief Rebel CEO and game director Axel Lindberg in a press release. “With <em>Fellowship</em>, we took inspiration from many games that we love to create a dungeon adventure that lets players jump right into the best part of MMOs and ARPGs, end-game dungeons, right from the start with ease. <em>Fellowship</em> will be a constantly evolving adventure and we want players of it from the very beginning, so we can’t wait for players to join us for our closed alpha playtest!”</p><p>Arc Games CEO Yoon Im added, “<em>Fellowship</em> marks the beginning of a new genre that aims to modernize the traditional [massively multiplayer online] gameplay experience, making it a potential game changer in our industry. We are thrilled to leverage our extensive online multiplayer and [massively multiplayer online] expertise to support Chief Rebel on this ambitious new video game.

This first of several unveilings looks at the most important part of the game: on-court play. For 2K25, the studio has committed more resources to expanding ProPlay, the game's unique animation system that translates real-life NBA footage into animations in-game.</p><p>This starts with what the team calls "the biggest change to our gameplay engine in many years," the all-new dribble engine. In all past versions of NBA 2K, dribbling the ball was pre-scripted and manually programmed using a library of mocapped animations. But starting with 2K25, that's no longer the case.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> NBA 2K25 | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now dribbling is led by ProPlay and its ability to turn game <em>tape</em> into game<em>play</em>. The 2K team says "stops are higher, launches are more explosive," and the feature brings more lifelike gameplay to the series across every inch of the court. Similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-things-coming-to-madden-25/1100-6524279/" data-ref-id="1100-6524279">Madden NFL 25's Boom Tech</a>, the new NBA 2K25 dribble engine seems like an idea that is hard to express but easy to understand once it's in your hands.</p><h2>New features on offense</h2><p>Flanking that headlining tech upgrade, NBA 2K25 also comes with a host of new mechanics on offense and defense. Let's start with the former. New to the game this year are tools such as shot canceling, signature go-to shots, shot-timing profiles, Pro Stick rhythm shooting, and more.</p><p>The signature go-to shots are, like so much else, powered by ProPlay. This new feature allows players to exercise new dribble-into-shot combos translated from NBA footage. This is done rather simply by holding up on the Pro Stick. Shot canceling allows players to transition from one shooting animation to another at the last moment, adding a new weapon to the offense's repertoire.</p><p>Shot-timing profiles come as a response to last year's intent to make shooting a more focused, sometimes difficult, process. These new profiles let players customize their shot-timing windows, thereby tweaking the risk-reward system.</p><p>For players choosing "low risk-reward," shot-timing will be more forgiving, emphasizing ratings, openness, and shot selection. A mistimed shot may still go in, but this option will make it harder to have consistently excellently timed shots because the green window will be smaller. Still, it solves the issue many had last year of non-green attempts missing the bucket. The inverse, "high risk-reward," comes with more difficult shots, resulting in green-or-miss outcomes--essentially what 2K24 offered, much to some players' dismay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344261-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344261" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344261-1%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344261"></a><figcaption>2K25's shot enhancements could turn you into the next Curry.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344261-1%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>New options for shot-taking visual cues also allow players to customize their ideal jump-shot release point, expanding on last year's Shot Creator suite. Essentially, players can decide when they release the ball in their custom animation, letting them grow more comfortable and in tune with the animation's timing window for hitting the perfect green beans.</p><p>A new touch to the Pro Stick, rhythm shooting, brings even more nuance to a shot's timing window from start to finish, as it demands players point the Pro Stick down to start the shot, then up when the animation reaches its Set Point. Visual Concepts revealed that, at first, many on the team found the new mechanic too difficult, but that those who stuck with it grew to appreciate it and now have a hard time reverting to the previous Pro Stick shooting style.</p><h2>New features on defense</h2><p>With all the new toys for offense, the defense is being buffed to reliably counter the attack. This starts with a new movement system that gives defenders the same fluid movement as offensive players by using the right stick. This allows for faster, tighter defensive cutoffs, leaving players less likely to get burned by a Pro Stick all-star with the ball in their hands.</p><p>Contested shots will now use a dynamic weighting system rather than the fixed one in previous games. This means more nuance in how contested a shot will be based on the defense's coverage at the start of a shot versus its release. To that end, ratings for perimeter and interior defense, as well as height, will be more important and directly affect outcomes.</p><p>AI teammates have been improved to better account for both real-world spacing differences mimicked in-game, as well as user freelancing. In short, your AI teammates should more often be where they're supposed to be based on the offense's formation, with over 20 new spacing adjustment locations inside the perimeter.</p><h2>Playbook sharing and new tutorials</h2><p>In 2K25, players can now create and share custom playbooks with the community, which will likely lead to new metas emerging in various competitive modes. If you need more help than that, however, the new Learn 2K mode offers a complete walkthrough of everything there is to learn about playing 2K, from the simplest mechanics to mastering all the new features mentioned above.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344260-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344260" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344260-1%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344260"></a><figcaption>Learn 2K mode is built for beginners, intermediates, and experts alike.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4344260-1%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2>Roadmap ahead</h2><p>Lastly, this is just day one of NBA 2K25's preview season.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-cuts-trust-and-safety-spending-amid-child-exploitation-concerns.942231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-financials-trust-safety-spending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>developer Roblox Corporation has released the platform's financial information for the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and it contains a rather concerning change to one of the company's key spending metrics.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/SH-Letter-Q2-2024.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shareholder letter</a> included alongside the company's <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q2-24-Supplemental-Materials-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest financial summary</a>, $121.9 million was spent on "infrastructure and trust &amp; safety expenses", down from the first quarter's figure of $124.4 million and significantly lower than the same time period last year.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned shareholder letter, Roblox Corporation attributes the changes made to the trust and safety expenditure figure to "internal efficiency initiatives, the shift to AI-driven moderation which increased the accuracy of our safety and civility systems, and optimizing infrastructure".</p>

<p>The company currently has a goal to grow by around 20% every year through 2027, and it's hard not to see the cutting of the trust and safety spending as part of the rush to achieve that goal, even if&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>itself attributes the lower figure to the aforementioned "internal efficiency initiatives".</p>
<p>Some may also question the timing of&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>lowering its trust and safety spending at a time when keeping&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>users, a great many of whom are children, safe is of paramount importance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent Bloomberg report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>has experienced problems with predators exploiting children on its platform, with over 13,000 reports of child exploitation on&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>being submitted to the&nbsp;National Center for Missing and Exploited Children last year alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-trust-and-safety-fairground.jpg?itok=eLrG-09Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-trust-and-safety-fairground.jpg?itok=-cqzKcOp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games may be fun, but there are certainly elements of the platform that aren't so jolly.</figcaption></figure><p>That's in addition to accusations that&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exploits child labor</a> in order to make money, a claim that studio head Stefano Corazza disputes, claiming instead that his studio is "offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job".</p>
<p>If you're interested in how&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>'s finances are doing in a more general sense, revenue in the second quarter of 2024 grew by 31% on a year-over-year basis, while daily active users grew by 21% when compared to last year.

            <p>Hey, remember that 2017 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/midboss">Midboss</a>? Or that 2020 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1258040/Super_Bernie_World/">Super Bernie World</a>, where you attempt to transform the US as a retro-fied Bernie Sanders? Yes or no, Kitsune Games have put out some good stuff in the past, and now they're back with a Super Bernie World followup: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a>. Again, it's a Super Mario-inspired platformer, but this time it's a wonderfully queer rescue mission inspired by Japanese mythology in a way that's cutesy and colourful. And it's out today!</p>

<p>In Kitsune Tails, you play as an unnamed kitsune, inspired by Japanese Inari Okami deity. Events transpire, leading you to develop a romantic interest in a young sorceress who helps you out in a time of need. But then drama! Your former mentor turned antagonist kidnaps this young sorceress and traps them inside an elemental prison. So, it is up to you to manifest "cute outfits" that'll help you rescue your newfound love.</p>
<p>Honestly, it looks like a really fun throwback to those GameBoy Super Marios. Your character can hop on "pangos" to make them curl up, then chuck them at enemies a la the turtles from Mario. And I like the look of some of the outfits, like one that transforms you into a shark that can swim or a shogun that can hop up walls by creating poles to swing from. Apparently there's five worlds to explore, alongside various haunted houses within which you'll need to carry lights "to reveal secret doors and ward off ghosts".</p>
<p>A nice touch is that if you're struggling, you can buy power ups at a shop or just "change playstyle" (whatever this means) to get instant revives. If you beat the game, "kaizo" levels are an optional extra and by "optional extra", I mean something that's absolutely nails.</p>
<p>If you're keen to give the game a look, you can find it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://eniko.itch.io/kitsunetails">itch.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re not aware of what 4DX is, it’s a movie format specific to Regal Cinemas whereby the theater chairs rock, shake, and rattle along with action, water sprays in your face, wind whips your hair, and more.

It’s got an incredible ensemble cast of weirdos who play the ragtag bunch of weather nerds, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alan Ruck, Cary Elwes, and Jami Gertz. It’s a quintessential ‘90s action movie that seamlessly melds practical effects and CGI and strikes the perfect balance between riotous action and inspiring romance. Though I love <em>Twisters</em>, it doesn’t reach the same heights as the original film, which I have watched well over two dozen times—and now I’ll be able to see it in 4DX.<br></p><p><em>Twisters</em> is also returning to 4DX after the internet demanded Regal bring it back to that format almost immediately after it left. The film has earned over $220 million worldwide since its July 19 release, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/twisters-4dx-screenings-box-office-blockbuster-glen-powell-1236079492/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/twisters-4dx-screenings-box-office-blockbuster-glen-powell-1236079492/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em> reports</a></span> much of that success was due to 4DX screenings. There is probably no film better suited for shaking seats, puffs of smoke, flashes of light, and spraying water than <em>Twisters</em>, so Regal would be leaving money on the floor if it didn’t give the people what they want. </p><p>“You don’t watch your movies, you ride ‘em,” reads the X (formerly Twitter) post from the official Regal account, a reference to Glen Powell’s “you don’t face your fears, you ride ‘em” line in <em>Twisters</em>. However, both <em>Twister</em> and <em>Twisters</em> will only be in 4DX theaters for a week starting August 30, so if you’re interested in an experience that feels like you’re surviving an actual tornado, you better act fast.<br></p><p>I already bought my tickets for both.&nbsp;<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The event will likely be in the vein of his past gaming streams—complete with a death counter and timer measuring how long it takes him to complete the game—though I suspect this marathon won’t be as long or difficult as <em>Elden Ring </em>proved. When he isn’t playing <em>Bloodborne</em>, Cenat will probably be entertaining celebrity guests, dressing up alongside friends of his, and sleeping onstream. I’m expecting a full on production, the likes of which we’ve previously seen from Cenat, who refurnished his streaming space to fit the aesthetics of <em>Elden Ring </em>as he played. His announcement post is probably a good indication of what’s to come.<br></p><p>Quite impressively, the trailer for the marathon is a mostly faithful recreation of <em>Bloodborne</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbH9jh5zU08&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbH9jh5zU08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening cutscene</a></span>. Taking place from the first-person perspective of the player character, the trailer reinterprets the scene into live-action and shows the faithful blood ministration that transports the player into the living nightmare of Yharnam, <em>Bloodborne</em>’s main setting.<br></p><p>As the camera whips between a blurry first-person view and a clearer third-person perspective, it’s revealed that Cenat is laying on the operating table of the clinic and has cast himself as the Hunter, the moniker given to the game’s main character. Unfortunately, Cenat and his crew stopped just short of recreating the entirety of the scene, which features a lupine beast emerging from blood before erupting into fire, and a subsequent swarm of ghoulish “messengers,” but I understand not getting bogged down in the weeds with all of that.<br></p><p>In the past, Cenat has approached similar titles, such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-steam-reviews-1851605129"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a></span>, because they’ve come heavily recommended by his fans. <em>Bloodborne </em>appears to be no different, but according to him, there’s an even greater purpose to this marathon than just content. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1818750571186356317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1818750571186356317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow up post</a></span>, Cenat claims, “This for the entire FromSoft Community who’ve been wishing for a remaster on this game and been wanting it on PC,” before continuing to say that his fans think he “could make something shake.”<br></p><p>Cenat’s <em>Elden Ring </em>streams garnered hundreds of thousands of live viewers, and the guy is regularly breaking streaming records these days, so it isn’t hard to imagine how much attention this is going to generate for <em>Bloodborne</em>. Though the game <em>is </em>deeply beloved and has grown into a revered classic, its exclusivity to the PS4 has hampered its ability to become a seller like <em>Elden Ring, </em>which has moved more than 25 million copies. While I wouldn’t bank on this escapade heavily influencing the likelihood of an eventual port or remaster, there will almost certainly be a resurgence of <em>Bloodborne </em>sales, and I’m really looking forward to seeing my favorite game back on the timeline.<br></p><p>Through the years, FromSoftware’s president Hidetaka Miyazaki—who’s also directed most of its biggest games including <em>Bloodborne</em>—has repeated that he’d <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-pc-port-ps5-fromsoftware-elden-ring-miyazaki-1851539098">love to see it ported to PC and modern consoles</a></span>, but has also stressed that the matter is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-sequel-remake-fromsoftware-sony-1851286901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-sequel-remake-fromsoftware-sony-1851286901">almost entirely out of his hands</a></span>.
