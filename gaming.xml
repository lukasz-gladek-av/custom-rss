            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-steam-xbox-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free Range and North Beach have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>on Steam and Xbox Series X|S, so if you've been holding off picking it up until it arrives on Steam, your time is almost here.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>arrives on Steam and Xbox on August 27th, and it's arriving alongside a major update for the game that will add a number of oft-requested features including crossplay, new gear, and a pause button for those playing in single-player.</p>
<p>Titled The Golden Update, the upcoming patch will&nbsp;be made available to all players when the Steam and Xbox releases hit, and it's even got a feature that was only available to beta branch players on the Epic Games Store previously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=2JAm5cQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=b9YO6Fuq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>is coming soon to Steam and Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, Sandbox Mode, which allows you to explore a procedurally-generated Moria at your own leisure. The devs say each playthrough can "vary significantly in layout and difficulty". Free Range does warn that this mode is mainly intended for those who are already familiar with&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>, though, because it offers minimal tutorializing.</p>
<p>Additionally, up to eight players can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>together no matter which platform they're playing on, so if you're playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-release-date">on the Epic Games Store or the PS5</a>, you'll soon be able to play alongside your Steam and Xbox buddies.</p>
<p>You'll also find recipes for new armor and weapons, and although they're only discoverable in Sandbox Mode, you'll be able to bring them across to the Campaign if you want to.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the Golden Update, you can check out everything that's new <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/aug27-golden-update" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the official website</a>. It's dropping on the same day as the Steam and Xbox Series versions of the game, but it's for players on all platforms.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-takes-you-on-a-tour-of-its-hyrule">Nintendo released a fresh trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, that's due out next month.
</p>
<p>
The game stars the titular princess in the leading role for the first time and includes a new Echo mechanic, where Zelda can essentially copy and paste elements from the world to explore and solve puzzles.
</p>
<p>
The new trailer focused on giving a tour of Hyrule, showing off its various regions, and the new power Bind that allows Zelda to attach herself to (and move with) objects and enemies. 
</p>
<p>
But there are some extra details in the trailer you may have missed. Check out the new trailer below first.
</p>

<h3>Horse riding</h3>
<p>
Ok, it's not exactly a missable detail that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> will include horse riding. But it is significant, in part because it's usually associated with the more expansive 3D Zelda games (though it was included in Four Swords Adventures). Zelda will be able to summon a horse once she (appropriately) learns the Echo for a carrot, but in the trailer we see both a brown and white horse suggesting there's no set Epona equivalent but multiple horses available. Horses can run and jump through the world, and she appears to arrive at what could be Lon Lon Ranch. The inclusion of horses, ultimately, hints towards the size of this world that seems larger than any other top-down Zelda before.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Region names</h3>
<p>
When Echoes of Wisdom was first revealed earlier this year, fans speculated the map appeared similar to that of A Link to the Past. Yet now we have confirmed region names, which are taken from more recent Zelda games. There's the Gerudo Desert for instance, which causes the princess to break out in a sweat, and its Gerudo tribe women look like chibi versions of their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> counterparts. The Faron Wetlands (Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild) is where we meet the Deku, while the game's mountainous region is called Eldin Volcano - this parallels Skyward Sword when usually Death Mountain is the iconic volcano. Lastly, the Zora reside in Jabul Waters, perhaps relating back to Ocarina of Time's giant fish Jabu Jabu.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-0-36-screenshot.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Adventuring is sweaty work | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Water regions</h3>
<p>
Speaking of water, we've seen already the game will include both sea and river Zora who appear to be feuding. Jabul Waters features pillars with the Water Medallion design from Ocarina of Time, while the River Zora village curiously includes musical instruments like a lute, maracas, and a horn. Could this hint at Majora's Mask's band The Indigo-Go's?</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-1-5-screenshot.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Spot the instruments! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Links to Breath of the Wild</h3>
<p>
Echoes of Wisdom certainly appears to be marrying the adorable top-down visuals of the Link's Awakening remake with the creativity and experimental vibe of the more recent Zelda games. Bind, in particular, feels analogous to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Ultrahand. More specifically, the UI and text font are the same and this new trailer provides a look at Zelda's Adventure Log. It's here players will prioritise quests, split between Side Quests and Main Quests. Interestingly, Zelda has multiple Main Quests available, suggesting a more open player-led structure more akin to the Switch Zelda games.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>This feels very similar to Breath of the Wild | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>

<h3>Japanese artwork</h3>
<p>
Outside of the trailer, Nintendo has released official artwork for Echoes of Wisdom. However, the Japanese version (as on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/bdgea/index.html">Japanese website</a>) is zoomed out slightly further and includes some extra details. The top left corner includes a small man on a paraglider - could he be a new postman perhaps? There's also a snake enemy in the bottom right, as well as what looks like a Wanted poster for Zelda. The previous trailer showed Zelda meeting new companion Tri in a jail cell before embarking on her adventure while cloaked, so it seems she could spend part of her adventure on the run.</p>
 <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Japanese version of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom key art includes a seemingly important key character that Nintendo hasn't talked about yet. </p><p>If you look in the upper left hand corner, you'll see him paragliding! <a href="https://t.co/mi7UeroeS3">pic.twitter.com/mi7UeroeS3</a></p></div>— Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1820811363553264013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p>
A few other small details from the trailer include a tiny cat and parrot in a hat in Gerudo town; a Goron leader named Darston, following the usual naming convention of the series (Darunia and Daruk, for example); and a map screen divided into sections, though it's unclear if map pieces will be acquired or if it will simply be unveiled by exploring.</p>


<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is set for release on 26th September and is shaping up to be a particularly unique entry in the long-running Nintendo series.

Over in the UK, we have flimsy, generic cardboard containers that cost £35,000 for a thimble-size, and we’re lucky for it. (However, we do win a bit, because unlike the weird, flavorless buttery nonsense you accept, we have sweetened or salted options, best mixed together.) What I’d give to be able to pick up some glorious tat like this.</p><p>And while Regal couldn’t match AMC for its puerile <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> bucket, it instead took to Instagram for a whole other version of childish, with a baby Deadpool sat sulking in a cinema seat.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"As a vengeful sorcerer unleashes a cursed fog upon the ancient Welsh Kingdom of Dyfed, a warrior-king finds himself entangled with beasts from the mythical Otherworld of Annwn," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3067260/Tales_from_the_Mabinogion/">explains the Steam page</a>. "To save his realm, he embarks on a quest to uncover the origins of the curse - and unlock the secrets necessary to thwart its devastating grip."</p>
<p>
Tales from the Mabinogion sees you following beast trails and wrangling with mystical animals in a landscape of faded organic pigments and thick brushstrokes inspired by Erin Hanson, Vincent Van Gogh, and Claude Monet (another parallel, if not an influence, is Aardman's World War fable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/11-11-memories-retold">11-11: Memories Retold</a>, whose art style is a commentary on the fallibility of memory). It's not clear whether any kind of fighting system is involved, but there's certainly confrontation and conflict. 
</p>
<p>
The Mabinogion of the title is a collection of ancient Welsh stories dating back to the 12th century. As you travel through the game, you'll tease out a few of these fragmentary fables. "Welsh is a beautiful, ancient, musical, magical language - the language that inspired Tolkien's Sildarin, the language of the Elves," Anastasoff comments in a release. "There is no more fitting way to tell a fantasy story!"
</p>
<p>
Anastasoff's collaborators include famed Warhammer scribe Gav Thorpe, author of The Lion. The game's Welsh script is the work of translator Rhys Iorwerth, and is narrated by Phil Rowe, whose other credits include Age Of Empires and Raid: Shadow Legends. Welsh folk musician Oliver Wilson-Dickson is doing the score.
</p>
<p>
The game launches on PC via Steam in 2025.

            <p>
Popular deck-building roguelike Balatro has now passed 2m sales and a major update is due next year.
</p>
<p>
The game was released across PC, Switch, PS5 and Xbox back in February and has proven particularly successful over the past six months.
</p>
<p>
Publisher Playstack and solo developer LocalThunk has a series of three announcements it's sharing across August and September, what it's calling a "Three-of-a-Kind of Surprises" campaign.

<p>
The first announcement is that a major gameplay update for Balatro will arrive in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Few details are currently available, though Playstack states the update will "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" when it's released across all platforms. It will also be completely free.
</p>
<p>
The remaining two announcements will be revealed at undisclosed times.

<p>
"I would never have thought that Balatro would be played by over two million people when I started working on it almost three years ago. I'm so grateful to all the players for giving it a chance and I'm excited to show everyone the next chapter for my game," said LocalThunk.
</p>
<p>
After its release, Balatro ran into controversy as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-like-poker-hit-balatro-pulled-from-sale-in-some-countries-due-to-unexpected-ratings-change">poker theme meant it was pulled from sale</a> in some countries due to an unexpected ratings change.

            <title><![CDATA[Maybe It Should Be Illegal To Instantly Delete A Website’s Archives]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-it-should-be-illegal-to-instantly-delete-a-website%E2%80%99s-archives.946896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last week it was reported</a> that GameStop, a clown show of a company peddling meme stocks and cheap video game merchandise, had unceremoniously and without notice shut down Game Informer, a magazine and website that had been publishing in some form since <em>1991</em>.</p><p>The decision was a terrible one for many reasons. For readers and fans, it deprives them of one of the few traditional games publications remaining <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the smoking ruins of this modern media apocalypse</a>. For staff it's a nightmare, with everybody facing a job market where video game journalism opportunities simply do not exist anymore.</p><p>There are also consequences for the wider internet. And for the history of video games, the history of video game criticism and media and, on a more personal note for the site and magazine's staff, the histories of everyone who ever worked for Game Informer or saw their work printed there. Because when GameStop pulled the plug last week, they didn't just end the publication of an extremely long-running magazine, they also killed its accompanying website (and, spitefully, even its Twitter account). It's just not there anymore. Not a single article from a website that had been around since <em>2003 </em>(or <em>1999 </em>if you're counting its pre-GameStop days) is now able to be viewed, as Game Informer's front page and navigation menu have been replaced with a single statement ominously called "The Final Level".</p><figure></figure><p>In the 21 years Game Informer's website was open--and this was a magazine that was once the centre of the video game media landscape thanks to its lavish reveal stories and covers--do you know how many other websites linked to its posts? How many Wikipedia pages, how many reports on the pages of peers and competitors, how many forums, emails, tweets and Facebook posts? It must be <em>countless</em>.</p><p>Game Informer's posts--and the links pointing to them--are the bedrock of our modern, online history. So much of the internet is built around clicking one thing to be taken to another, links piled atop decades of older links, that it's become part of our subconscious user experience, as second-nature to being online as putting one foot in front of the other is to walking down the street. But that clicking only works when there's something to click <em>to</em>.</p><p>In tearing down Game Informer's website, GameStop has torn the nervous system out of a huge part of gaming media's dying body. You now can't read any old Game Informer posts, and most of the old links pointing towards them work anymore. Where Game Informer once stood there's now nothing but a gaping black hole, with torn wires hanging around its edges. Were it not for the Internet Archive (and Wikipedia editors’ herculean efforts in substituting its links with archived substitutes) salvaging some old stories and links, it would be as though the site had never existed in the first place.</p><p>Of course, Game Informer is not the first publication to be treated like this, nor will it be the last. It's only been a few weeks since<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MTV News suffered a similar fate</a>. And every time it happens, I ask myself the same question: <a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/02/messenger-gawker-vice-media-layoffs-sites-deleted-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how is this allowed</a>?</p><p>I know this might sound like the pissbaby whinings of one of the few people on the planet who would truly care about this--a video games journalist<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whose own archival contributions are hanging by a thread</a>--but I'm coming around to the idea that it, if you own or buy an online media company, it should be illegal to wipe the site and its archives as swiftly and heartlessly as this.</p><p>You can't (unless you try really hard) erase a newspaper or book. They exist in a physical space, and can be archived physically, just<a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/repositories/2/resources/42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as the Video Game History Foundation have done with Game Informer's own print edition</a>. But you can very easily kill a website. You just...take it down. Sure, as I've mentioned, the Internet Archive can pick up <em>some </em>of the slack, but as I've found trying to retrieve some of my own older works (Kotaku's pre-2008 archives are all but lost), its coverage can often be patchy at best, and is no substitution for a site's own complete archives.</p><p>If a shithead owner wants to close a site and lay everyone off, there's not much anyone can do about that, the gods will come for them or their descendants sooner or later. But to erase a site's archives is wrong. To block them without notice is actively spiteful. It belies a contempt for the product, that this thing you owned means so little to you that it can be erased from history at the click of a button.</p><figure><figcaption>Just in case you were wondering if there was any malice in this or not | Screenshot: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3kyyj3blpgr2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendeal</a></figcaption></figure><p>But it <em>did </em>mean something, to a lot of people smarter and kinder than anyone who has ever made a decision this cruel. At the very least, the writers and editors who worked there deserved a chance to retrieve their contributions, to catalogue some part of careers that spanned years or even decades. And the rest of us are entitled to some semblance of a working internet.</p><p>I'm not saying archives need to be kept up indefinitely--<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though Lord knows that comes in handy sometimes</a>--as that would be unworkable, but maybe there should at least be regulations governing how quickly the curtain comes down on a commercial website, and with how much notice. How <em>much</em> time? At least enough for people to be able to retrieve their work, or in best-case scenarios, to find a new home for the archives that the current owners clearly value so little they were willing to throw it in the bin and turn the lights off.</p><p>I know this isn't a serious proposition. There's about as much chance of a government enacting a Digital Media Preservation Act as there is a commercial website's owners truly valuing the contributions of its embattled journalists. Whether it could actually happen or not isn't my point here though, my point is that murdering a website is such a shitty thing to do, yet is something that so many people seem totally fine doing, that it <em>should </em>be illegal because that would be the only way we're ever going to stop this from happening over and over and over again.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new round of actual hands-on previews now seem to prove that it wasn’t all smoke and mirrors. <em>Space Marine 2 </em>sounds like it keeps its eye on the <em>40K </em>prize with a three-player PVE mode called Operations that nails what fans love about the gothic space fantasy of the source material.

There’s a <em>Sekiro</em>-esque perfect-parry system, but she felt the canned animations, while enjoyable, also made the flow of combat more choppy. Despite a linear single-player campaign, the meat of the game seemed to be in the six-class multiplayer PVE mode which is full of unlocks and customizations. “<em>Space Marine 2</em> has a real shot at being the quintessential third-person action game set in the <em>40K</em> universe,” Hafer wrote. </p><p>If the PVE mode sounds similar to the loot-based horde mode game <em>Darktide</em>, well, that’s exactly the comparison <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-delivers-maximum-warhammer-to-glorious-effect&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-delivers-maximum-warhammer-to-glorious-effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Chris Tapsell drew</a></span>.  <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s take is less atmospheric but also more streamlined in its class-building and progression. Tapsell called it “schlockier” overall and better at embracing the “unthinking fanaticism” of the <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy. “This is a double-A game in triple-A clothing, in many senses, simple pleasures and just occasional jank, with a layer of grim, gothic fidelity over the top,” Tapsell wrote, describing the type of less ambitious, more focused shooter we don’t get as often these days. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/within-10-minutes-of-killing-tyranids-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-become-my-most-anticipated-shooter-of-2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/within-10-minutes-of-killing-tyranids-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-become-my-most-anticipated-shooter-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em>’s Andrew Brown</a></span> was even more enthusiastic, saying his time with the game turned it into his most anticipated of the year. “The way in which you move from shooting to melee and back is exceptionally fluid, and there were several fights where I felt like a force of nature, which is exactly what playing a Space Marine should feel like,” he wrote. “Even when I was up against Chaos Space Marines and hordes of demons, who crept into the preview level to fight Tyranids and Imperium alike, I was outnumbered but always felt like the strongest person on the battlefield.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PCGamesN</em>’s Ross McInally</a></span> was much more harsh on the main campaign, criticizing what he saw as by-the-book missions and boss battles that make you unlearn the lessons the game has taught you. Also glitches. The Operations mode was a different story, with the ability to paint each piece of armor giving <em>Space Marine 2</em> a bit of the sensibility of the miniatures tabletop game that inspired it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-brutal-gratifying-gameplay-is-doing-warhammer-40000-right/1100-6525419/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-brutal-gratifying-gameplay-is-doing-warhammer-40000-right/1100-6525419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em>’s Dave Jewitt</a></span> was also bullish on game’s virtues as a <em>Warhammer </em>adaptation. </p><p>“Overall, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is shaping up to be a more than worthy successor to the 2011 fan favorite,” he wrote. “Everything that made the original <em>Space Marine</em> great is still there but as a much more considered and evolved version of itself, all of which comes together to make <em>Space Marine 2 </em>feel like both a familiar old friend and an exciting new experience.” That’s all fans of the original need to hear. </p><p><em>Space Marine 2</em> was originally supposed to ship last year, before being delayed to 2024. It’s now set to come out on September 9. There were supposed to be free betas for fans to test out the game for themselves ahead of release, but developer Saber Interactive canned them in order to focus on having “the best launch” possible. Some features and hidden reveals were already spoiled for fans when an old build of the game leaked earlier this summer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-leak-warhammer-40k-focus-saber-1851594237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-leak-warhammer-40k-focus-saber-1851594237">Saber warned players to stay away</a></span>, hoping their first experience of the game would be the finished product rather than in-progress work. So far it sounds like it will be worth the wait. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new series of <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts on X</a>, the team behind Balatro revealed it has now sold 2 million copies, as well as a 2025 release window for its first major gameplay update.</p>



<p>There is no concrete release date for the update, and today’s post only broadly elaborates on content. The devs state it will “bring new ideas and strategies to the game.” They also add that “the update will be completely free,” thanking the community.</p>



<p>While there aren’t any specific details about the update, it is only one of three big announcements. </p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, the Balatro team also announced they have “two more surprises this summer,” inviting fans to “keep an eye out for some more exciting news.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The first major gameplay update is coming to Balatro in 2025!</p><p>This update will bring new ideas and strategies to the game and as a token of huge appreciation to the game’s brilliant and passionate community, the update will be completely free. <a href="https://t.co/xS8ZQrTZGi">pic.twitter.com/xS8ZQrTZGi</a></p></div>— Balatro (@BalatroGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184855876804841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Balatro added its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-getting-its-first-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major update</a> a couple of months ago, but the 1.0.1 update focused on balancing changes and fixes instead of gameplay. It adjusted some ante scaling, buffs, and more, though it did feature some new joker types. </p>



<p>The indie strategy game’s sales continue to impress, as it first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-1-million-copies-sold-fun-things-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit 1 million copies sold</a> just weeks after launching earlier this year. </p>



<p>In March 2024, developer LocalThunk previously announced plans to add more updates, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-coming-to-iphone-more-updates-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring Balatro to the iPhone</a>. Balatro is certainly suited for mobile gameplay, with its swift pacing and creative ideas livening up the roguelike genre.</p>

            <p>
Dead Space developer and Striking Distance co-founder Glen Schofield left Striking Distance last September, following lower-than-hoped sales and mixed reviews for the studio's debut project The Callisto Protocol. Now, he's back to share a little about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's difficult development, offering details of cut materials, a complicated relationship with parent company Krafton, the impact of Covid, and abandoned plans for a sequel.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The interview in question is with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ">Youtuber Dan Allen</a>. While more appreciative than critical, it's a long, candid chat that's worth watching in full if you're interested in the game. I've put together some highlights. 
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance were founded in 2019 as part of Krafton's efforts to establish revenue streams beyond their legendary battle royale Plunkbat, aka PUBG: Battlegrounds. The Callisto Protocol began life as a game in the PUBG universe but eventually became its own thing, heavily inspired by Dead Space. It was a tough project from the outset. "We started off with a new studio, a new company, a new IP, a new everything," Schofield recalled to Allen. "And then we're six months into it, and they say, by the way, there's new consoles. They actually thought, let's just switch to PS5, and I said well that's a magnitude harder. We're talking millions of dollars more." 
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, Schofield said the relationship between Striking Distance and Krafton was positive at first. "I really liked working with them for the first couple of years. It was really the last year or so [before I left] - we went public and it put an awful strain on the company, the board of directors and everybody else, and then they put the strain on us."
</p>
<p>
Amongst other things, Schofield feels he was deceived about how much time Striking Distance had to finish the game, which led to impractical project scoping. "I wanted about three and a half more months, and I was led to believe for about three months, four months that that's the way it was going to be," he said. "Actually in October or September of '21, I was told that, you know, you're going to get the time - just, 'no regrets'. That was the term that kept being used, 'no regrets'. Just put whatever you want into the game." 
</p>
<p>
Buoyed by this encouragement, Schofield and other Striking Distance devs spent the Xmas 2021 holiday working on the game - "just designing, coming up with other ideas with some of the guys. And January comes around and some of the [Krafton] folks come over and they just said, 'no, no, no, no - it's December of 2022'.
</p>
<p>
"And I was like, it's not going to get done and it's going to cost you more money. It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner, no. Because if I just kept it on the way it was going, I wouldn't have to add anybody. But if you want it done, I got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here - if I need 20 people, I actually need to get 30 or 40, because that learning curve will not adjust."
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, Schofield says he should have "put my foot down on not shipping it", to the point of challenging Krafton to take away control of the company. "If you want the game to ship, come take over the studio and ship it. Sometimes you don't know who you are, and four or five years ago I was like, who am I, telling these guys I'm not going to ship it. I should have, absolutely."
</p>
<p>
Schofield isn't without fault amid all this. In October 2022, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/striking-distance-studios-ceo-posts-then-deletes-a-tweet-thought-by-some-to-promote-crunch-culture">boasted</a> on Xitter about Striking Distance staff working "6-7 days a week". Schofield subsequently apologised in an interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Inverse</a> for making his employees crunch on the game, and promised to keep healthier working hours during subsequent projects. I'd be interested to get some perspective on his management tactics from other members of Striking Distance, former or current.
</p>
<p>
The Callisto Protocol met with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">iffy verdicts at launch</a>, not least thanks to technical problems on PC. In the wake of its release, Schofield says that Striking Distance and Krafton essentially stopped talking to each other. "As we're making DLC, I kid you not, they started ignoring me. The game came out December 2nd. As we're making DLC, I'm telling the team to start <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocols-pc-patches-restore-it-to-full-yeah-its-alright-glory">patching</a> - I'm going to go out to the community, I'm going to ask them for help. We know what we want to put in the game, and we're just going to patch it. And so we just kept patching. And Krafton weren't talking to us - they were just like, where's the DLC? We did 86 patches, and in three and a half months, that's what we needed. And on PlayStation Network it kicked ass. The reviews were really good."
</p>
<p>
According to Schofield, Krafton lacked the experience as a company to nurture an original videogame property beyond PUBG. "What new IPs need around them is some steady guys, but the truth is they were so new at the time - they didn't have any new evergreen-type games". He feels it's absurd that Krafton haven't (that we know of) greenlit a sequel, given the amount that had to be chopped from The Callisto Protocol during development. "The fact they're not making it is ridiculous, because Callisto, we had to cut two and a half bosses out of it. I mean, I had to cut like three or four enemies out of it." 
</p>
<p>
Some of these cuts were brought about not by Krafton's release schedule but staff sickness during the on-going Covid pandemic. "America lost 1.2 million people, right?" Schofield said. "This wasn't like 'oh, they're getting sick'. One of my best friends, my college roommate died. We all lost people. 
</p>
<p>
"On top of that, when someone got sick, and inevitably you have a studio of 200-250 people, 10 to 20 people a month were getting sick, and they were getting sick for weeks, right? We were devastated. It was sometimes our whole department of VFX would be out, our animation department." Differences between how the US and South Korean governments handled the pandemic exacerbated communication difficulties with Krafton. "When I would call in Korea they're not having that problem, right? You know, we don't follow rules as well maybe [in the USA]? I don't know what it is, but we have a bigger country, you know, it doesn't matter. 
</p>
<p>
"We lost a lot of people. We went through hell, and then on top of that in '21, we had the 'great resignation'. We had 49 people quit on top of that. Because everybody's paying through the roof, and so people are leaving for $10,000 more, and they don't have to leave their house - all they got to do is turn in their equipment, and in most cases, we tell them you can keep the equipment. 2021 was the worst year in development of my life, because you had Covid going on, you had the great resignation going on. I did not even think we'd get the game done. And we're cutting stuff to get it out. We added some stuff back in in the end. Freed up some time - not time, freed up some people. But you're right, there should be a sequel."
</p>
<p>
Schofield's abandoned plans for the sequel include a story concept featuring side character Dani Nakamura as lead. Another scenario would have brought back the original game's Jacob, who was voice-acted by Josh Duhamel. "I wanted to bring back Josh and but I actually wanted to to act like he was dead, and start off with a different character and then halfway through this character dies, and then they're like 'well, we know one guy' and then you surprisingly bring him back," Schofield said.
</p>
<p>
I wasn't a huge fan of The Callisto Protocol myself, but I am automatically enthused for anything that whiffs of Dead Space, and I'm sorry to hear that development of the game was such an ordeal. Again, though, I'd like to get some perspective beyond Schofield's on the making of the game.

			<p>KRAFTON, the developers of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has announced the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest update</a> for the game, which is now live on PC. This update is a game changer for any who utilize the PUBG Clans system. PUBG Clans will now be able to unlock weekly rewards by completing challenges and missions. There are also new weapon attachments for those who enjoy modding their weapons to the fullest.</p>
<p>The new Clan Challenges and Clan Member Missions provides new ways to engage as a team and earn in-game rewards. It allows Clan members to complete challenges together to earn Gauge Points, which will then go on to determine the class of the Clan Supply Airplane.</p>
<p>The higher the class, the better the rewards will be when they are able to open the new Clan Loot Caches. Clan members will have to stay consistent with the amount of missions and challenges they complete though, as the Gauge Points slightly decrease weekly, which could make or break the class of the Clan Supply Airplane.</p>
<p>In addition to these challenges and missions, Clans in<a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/"> PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</a> can now earn an exclusive currency called Clan Tokens by successfully completing Weekly Clan XP Goals. Once you have earned these tokens, you can then use them at the Clan Token Exchange, which can be used to purchase a wide variety of items such as Clan Tag Plates, Sandbox Mode Tickets, Hunter's Chest Tickets and much more. In addition, Clans can now add community links on the Clan Management page, which can help Clans be more organized with their play time.</p>
<p>In addition to the Clan update, there are a bunch of new and updated attachments in PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS. This includes the Muzzle Brake attachment, which is compatible with most ARs, DMRs and some Shotguns. By using this attachment, it significantly reduces camera shake when firing, and can help with horizontal and vertical recoil.</p>
<p>In addition to the Muzzle Break attachment, existing attachments such as the Holographic Sight, Thumb Grip, Angled Foregrip, Lightweight Grip and Heavy Stock all received updates to make the experience smoother and more enjoyable for the players.</p>
<p>The last major element of this update is the beginning of Ranked Season 31. With the start of the new season, players will now be able to receive their rewards from participating in Season 30. These rewards include Emblems, Medals and Nameplates, which will vary according to the player's final tier from the previous Ranked season.</p>
<p>Players who managed to obtain the Gold Tier or above will receive a Ranked Weapon Skin. The rewards given after the season ends are available for use exclusively during a single Ranked season, except for permanent items such as the Ranked Weapon Skins and Medals.</p>

In this quarter, 2.4 million PS5 consoles were sold, a figure that's down by 27% when compared to the 3.3 million PS5 consoles sold during the same period in the previous financial year.</p><p>Overall, Sony says Q1 sales in its Games and Network Services section were still up 12% year-on-year, resulting in a 32% increase in operating income. The company added that first-party sales and PlayStation Plus subscriptions grew, with 80% of the 53.6 million PS5 games sold in Q1 being digital purchases. Software sales brought in $3.30 billion in revenue, almost 20% growth year-on-year, but hardware revenue did decline by 21% to $990 million.</p>

<p>Sony also reported 116 million registered monthly active users, an increase when compared to 108 million last year but a decrease from Q4 FY23's 118 million. Looking ahead, Sony has a relatively quiet year when it comes to first-party games. Multiplayer game Concord launches later this month and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-sequel-announced-for-ps5-coming-september-6/1100-6523821/">Astro Bot sequel arrives on September 6</a>, but beyond that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-major-sony-franchise-game-releases-are-coming-until-april-2025-at-earliest/1100-6521071/" data-ref-id="1100-6521071">no new entries from major franchises</a> like Spider-Man, God of War, The Last of Us, or Horizon are expected until April 2025 at the earliest.</p><p>There are several big third-party games scheduled to arrive later this year on PS5--Star Wars Outlaws, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and EA Sports FC 25, to name a few--and Sony has adjusted its forecast for the gaming division, predicting a 3% increase in sales and operating income for the 2024 financial year.</p>

You're getting Vault Tec, Hot Rod Flames, Brotherhood of Steel Paladin, Military, and Rusted paint jobs, and each figure comes with an accessory like a box of Sugar Bombs breakfast cereal. Admittedly you won't be doing a lot of construction here, as you're only building rigs for the figures to rest in, but once everything has been assembled and put together, the end result looks impressive. This even comes in a Fallout 4 crate-inspired box, for that extra touch of authenticity.</p><p>If you're looking to build a Fallout shrine with some more collectibles, the McFarlane Movie Maniacs line has some great options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/McFarlane-Toys-Movie-Maniacs-Exclusive/dp/B0CQ8SSCRJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">You can pick up a three-pack of figures for $110</a>, and this includes Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus from the Fallout TV series.

                <p>There hasn't been an official new Fallout game for years now, but the fan-made Fallout 4 mod Fallout London is the closest thing we're going to get for a while. Team FOLON, the developer of the mod, says that a hotfix is coming soon to fix crashing issues that many players have reported, and that a large update will come soon after.</p><p dir="ltr">Team FOLON announced the move on its Discord (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-hotfix-still-on-the-way-along-with-huge-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix. This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We've also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help…We're already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PuzpblWpVM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PuzpblWpVM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Released in late July, Fallout London completely overhauls Fallout 4 and all of its DLC. The mod includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/">many of the elements</a> you'd expect, including double-decker buses, red phone booths, and some of the global capital's more famous landmarks. It replaces the series' usual currency of bottle caps with Tube Tickets, and its version of London is comparable to Fallout 4's Boston in scope and scale.</p><p dir="ltr">But while the mod has garnered a warm reception from players, its stability issues <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1eg2zj7/my_lengthy_fallout_london_review/" rel="nofollow ">have been noted</a> by many, so it's good to hear that they're working on fixing them. In other Fallout news, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-marks-500-million-monthly-players-notes-fallout-tv-shows-impact-on-game-pass/1100-6525422/" data-ref-id="1100-6525422">pointed</a> to the success of the Fallout TV show as a major factor in Microsoft Gaming notching 500 million monthly players across all platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-sales-top-600k-three-months-out-from-launch.946797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-600k<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Deep Field Games and publisher Playstack have announced another major&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>sales milestone, so it looks like the indie survival-crafter is still trundling along very nicely.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597617796542" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the two studios announce that the game has reached 600,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been out for around three months.</p>
<p>At last count,&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>sales stood at 250,000, a figure the game achieved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">within just a week or so</a> on sale, so while sales have slowed down, they've remained pretty strong considering this is an indie project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-artwork.jpg?itok=F5GEemf0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-artwork.jpg?itok=Q-jGBnhF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>has racked up 600,000 sales, which isn't bad.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll also be pleased to know that there's likely more news about the game coming up, although Playstack and Deep Field are remaining tight-lipped about what it might be for now.</p>
<p>In the announcement, the two studios say that the new sales figure "isn’t the only big announcement we’ve got for this week". Could we be about to get a reveal for a console version of&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>? We can but hope.</p>
<p>If you haven't come across&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>before, it's a survival-crafter set in a science facility that's sort of like a cross between&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s Black Mesa and the SCP containment HQ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and your fellow players (if, indeed, you choose to play with others) play as a group of scientists stranded in the facility, and you must scavenge for resources, build yourself a new base, and deal with the creatures and other hazards roaming the corridors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-corridor.jpg?itok=RQVTMUND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-corridor.jpg?itok=2JmmJDWF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More surprises are on the way for&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>represents another hit for publisher Playstack; the studio has also enjoyed success recently with poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">broke a million sales earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to know what all the fuss is about, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

<p>
Sifu, from French developer Sloclap, released back in 2022 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">critical acclaim</a> and has since received multiple updates and additions. It's a martial arts roguelite in which its protagonist gradually ages each time they die.

<p>
High on Life, meanwhile, was developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland whose involvement was removed following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-co-creator-departs-high-on-life-studio-he-founded-following-allegations">allegations of domestic abuse</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">Eurogamer's High on Life review</a> described the game as "a mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem", but it was received positively by fans.

<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">Humble Choice</a> is the monthly subscription service from Humble, which provides a number of games available to own forever. Five percent of every membership fee goes to charity - this month's charity is the World Wildlife Fund.

<p>
At the end of last month, Humble's publishing arm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games confirmed a company "restructuring"</a> following reports of staff layoffs.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live.946791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest season for Diablo IV is now live, titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-begins-on-august-6/">Season of the Infernal Hordes</a>. In this season, players will get to experience a new wave-based feature called Infernal Hordes, where you can slay waves of enemies time and time again to gain rewards.</p>
<p>For the first time in Diablo IV's history, this feature will be available in both the Seasonal Realm and the Eternal Realm. For the Seasonal Realm, there will be a Seasonal Questline that unlocks it, and with the Eternal Realm, there'll be a brief new Questline that unlocks the Infernal Hordes feature.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the new wave-based system is available on World Tier III, after players have completed the necessary questline. You can choose to kill the demons with friends or by yourself, selecting Infernal Offerings along the way that can either help or hinder your run. These Infernal Offerings not only give you a boon, but they also aid the demons by increasing their potency and the number of enemies that you will have to face off against. Players will have a limited amount of revives that can be used while battling through the Infernal Hordes. Lose all of your lives, and you'll be consumed by the demons.</p>
<p>A new exclusive feature to the Seasonal Realm is the Hellbreach Dungeons. They serve as an introduction before players dive head first into Infernal Hordes, which also comes with Seasonal Progression and the Season Journey.</p>
<p>This season, there are a lot of new changes that are arriving in Diablo IV, including 50 new Uniques and Legendaries that will continue to benefit the player long after the season has ended. The weapons that have specific qualities will have the best chance of appearing from Spoils of Hell in the Infernal Hordes, so make sure to keep an eye out for those weapons.</p>
<p>With this new season comes a bunch of tweaks and quality-of-life changes. This includes updates to the Helltide, Legendary drop rates and much more.</p>
<p>For example, Baneful Heart drops in the Helltide are now increased, and are guaranteed to drop from Helltide Commanders. Tortured Gifts now cost 75 Cinders.</p>
<p>Uber Uniques will now be known as Mythic Uniques, and will cast a obvious beacon of light into the sky if you find one to make sure you don't miss out on this loot. In addition, Legendary drop chances are now increased once you are past Level 100, if you are playing in the Helltide, Nightmare Dungeons or the Infernal Hordes.</p>
<p>Blizzard has released a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge blog post</a> detailing everything you need to know about the Season of the Infernal Hordes, including all PTR changes.</p>
