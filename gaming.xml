		<p>Ubisoft has announced the Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes expansion, with this new content looking like it will be bringing in the Mangkwan Clan, also known as the Ash People. This clan is going to be focal point of the next Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash. In terms of release date, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes will be launching on December 19th, a few days after Avatar: Fire &amp; Ash hits cinemas.</p>

<p>This won’t be the only content coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in December either. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">A third person patch</a> was confirmed earlier this year, with a release date pencilled in for December 5th. The third-person mode is seeing Massive Entertainment completely overhauling character animations, tweaking controls and audio, and the camera to adapt the game from first person to third person. In addition, Beyond that, a New Game+ mode will be added, letting you replay the story and keep inventory and skills, while facing tougher enemies. Now we know there will be some new enemies to take on.</p>
<p>We loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, <em>“Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</em></p>

<figure><a title="Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159049/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Isn’t it comforting to settle in with a good book that you already know? Microids certainly seem to hope so, as their Studio Lyon is snuggling yet another Christie classic right into your Switch.</p>
<p>A follow-up to 2023’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/agatha_christie_-_murder_on_the_orient_express">Murder on the Orient Express</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/agatha_christie_-_death_on_the_nile">Death on the Nile</a> may not be as big as that choo-choo colossus, but it nearly is. So, Studio Lyon has brought the same challenge upon itself: how can a classic this classic be made to feel fresh? And how can you make a mystery game when so many of the audience are already expecting the solution? Luckily, the devs hit upon a formula for it last time, and now it’s back with bells and whistles.</p>
<p>For one thing, the setting has been updated from the 1930s to the '70s. We open on a swishing pair of bell-bottoms, the camera panning up to snaking hips on their way into a disco. This slinky customer is none other than the latest rendition of Hercule Poirot, the legendary detective, now with a collar wider than his trademark moustache and a cravat that suits him to a T. It may be Agatha Christie via <strong>Starsky and Hutch</strong>, but some things don’t change.</p>
<figure><a title="Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159045/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From dancefloor to detective work, we Moog and wah-wah our way into a third-person adventure perspective, free to stroll around and start chatting up the clientele. This is the backbone of the game: explore, examine, discuss, and solve mysteries from major to trifling. This may mean unravelling the social complexities of a love triangle, cracking the titular river-based murder, or simply arranging suitcases in the boot of a car. The mini challenges like that last one are tacked on a little roughly, however, ranging as they do from simply using a rotary phone to mending a jukebox via five different Christmas-cracker logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Another hallmark of the Poirot games under Microids’ stewardship is the “mind map”. This is a 2D, visual representation of the web of interconnected facts and deductions that make up the case in each chapter. These various observations must be collected during play, then connected and expanded upon in this liminal space inside Poirot’s head. Previous games — especially before Studio Lyon took the reins — made these connections a baffling mix of the obtuse and the obvious, driving you to guesswork to grind out the truth the game wants from you. Death on the Nile is comfortably the most coherent go at the idea yet.</p>
<figure><a title="Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159043/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But the standout addition to this visualised reasoning is a timeline-building mode that drops the world into an almost sci-fi purple and orange glowing wireframe. You walk around these spaces, associating characters with actions at each step in time. It’s like a cross between a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> braindance and a spaced-out hippie’s lava lamp dream.</p>
<p>And that really sums up the essence of the game: it’s an easy ride. Lots of relaxed conversations, low-key, '70s-tinged music, easy puzzles, and slow-paced cutscenes are the order of the day. It may not be everyone’s cup of fussily prepared tea, but it absolutely suits the concept of revisiting a good old classic story. Success always feels like a foregone conclusion, so relax and enjoy the river cruise. A pop-up instruction that summed it up for me read, “New objective: go to dinner” – and that’s dinner on the type of boat that has a cocktail lounge and smoking room. Nice.</p>
<figure><a title="Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159047/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some measures have been taken to liven things up – in response, the developers say, to player feedback. These include difficulty modes that strip away guidance layer by layer — a bit antithetical to the game’s raison d’être in my view — and collectibles scattered around the chapters. If you haven’t found a golden moustache in a bidet, have you had a true Poirot experience? Yes, actually. Thankfully, these additions are completely optional and non-judgmental. You’ll get a chapter report of your collectibles, hint count, and so on, but it doesn’t come with a great big “D” rating if you weren’t up to scratch. No pressure here.</p>
<p>But the biggest contrast to the happy cruise of Poirot-by-numbers is Jane Royce, private investigator. Jane is a new side character with a mission of her own: to avenge the death of her close friend who’d uncovered a conspiracy. This leads her into the gritty streets of The Bronx – a strong counterpoint. She runs about to intense prog rock; Poirot sips wine to easy jazz.</p>
<p>Jane also introduces some tension with consequence-carrying decisions that affect the story. If you thought this was a snuggled-up cruise through a well-loved classic, then — wakey wakey — there’s a drive-by to deal with.</p>
<figure><a title="Agatha Christie - Death on the Nile Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159050/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While all this does work to give a change of pace, it also feels a little incongruous. Just as you’re getting into the flow of one narrative, you’re passed back to the other. It might have been nice if the two threads were woven together more closely earlier in the adventure. Some light action scenes can also feel a touch disjointed. Steering a boat or taking on an impromptu stealth challenge add variety, but they don’t really fit with the game’s greatest strength, which is cosy coasting through a timeless story.</p>
<p>Visually, things look pretty great. The most significant quibble is probably the animation in cutscenes: characters sometimes move like puppets in a way that’s almost nostalgic for the PS2 era – or <strong>The Clangers</strong>, since we’re in the 70s. They almost look like they’re carved from wood, too, which is an art style that looks good without striving for the latest AAA standards. The environments, meanwhile, are varied and attractive, bringing the period to life with the expected staples: dungarees, egg chairs, and the colour brown. Performance isn’t as smooth as Poirot’s wardrobe, but it’s plenty good enough for this type of game.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Death on the Nile, Microids Studio Lyon has settled into a great formula for a Poirot adventure: a supporting playable character brings novelty and gives the moustachioed star room to ham it up as a lightly comic persona. Some mildly disjointed pacing and a dozily relaxed speed might put some people off, but if you want the cosy feeling of curling up with a good mystery novel, then this is absolutely the game for you.</p></section>

            <p>
Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> hotfix, this one being number 34, or version 4.1.1.6931813 of the game if you really want to be specific. There's a number of fixes we'll get to in a minute, but first the thing you're probably most excited to hear: it has a native Steam Deck build now! Developer Larian Studios shared word of this change in a Steam news post today, and what exactly it means for you.
</p>
<p>
The big things you should now notice while playing on Steam Deck is that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has a more stable framerate, that loading times won't be quite as long, and just generally smoother gameplay. As explained in the news post, this hotfix has made some changes to how game models are streamed in, meaning across all platforms areas like the Lower City in Act 3 that are known for their framerate spikes will work better too.
</p>
<p>
In turns of the big difference between the previous version of Baldur's Gate 3 and this one for Steam Deck users, before it was a Proton version that ran on the Steam Deck via a Proton compatibility layer. This meant it was more intensive on the handheld's CPU, but now that it runs natively it'll need less CPU usage and memory consumption overall!"
</p>
<p>
There's some details on where to find your saves in both versions of the game, and if you use Steam Cloud saves, you'll find your saves post-update anyway. As long as you're logged into your Larian account, all mods you're subscribed to should be downloaded when the game transitions into the native build.
</p><p>
Now, some of the other more general fixes! On the gameplay side, the Hound of Ill Omen and the Accursed Spectre's HP will no longer be affected by difficulty modifiers for enemy characters. An annoying bug that caused the Apostle of Myrkul to gain HP every time you would load a save mid-combat in Tactician and Honour Mode has also been fixed.
</p>
<p>
There are a bunch of audio fixes in this one too, like an issue where it sounded like smokepowder explosions going off on the floor above on the ground floor of Felogyr's Fireworks would send like they're happening next to you instead.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps my favourite fix is in the cinematics section, which simply reads, "Told one of the imps on the nautiloid to stop looking in the wrong direction." You tell 'em, patch notes writer. You can read the full list of patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278">here</a>.

              <p>After years of development hell, a couple of Ubisoft’s many non-gaming projects appear to be genuinely happening. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-anime-netflix-2000619516"><em>Splinter Cell</em> animated series</a> begins airing next month after forever in development. Meanwhile, a year after filming was said to be completed on a <em>Watch_Dogs</em> movie, signs of life have appeared in the form of some recent reshoots and the declaration from one of the film’s actors that it’s nothing like the games.</p> <p>Post-production is obviously a lengthy process in projects bursting with CG, with most movies now enlisting the work of multiple SFX studios once shooting has wrapped. But a year without a single piece of news, early teaser, or even a leak still makes you wonder, especially as this silence came after <a href="https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-movie-live-action-film-ubisoft-decade-later-1851575957">the extraordinary ten-year gap</a> between the <a href="https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-isnt-out-yet-but-theres-a-movie-in-the-wo-1172993658">film’s announcement</a> and actually getting it in the can. However, news of reshoots <a href="https://screenrant.com/watch-dogs-movie-game-tom-blyth-comparison/">reported by&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em></a> suggests things are definitely still progressing. What’s more intriguing, however, is the claim from the movie’s lead, Tom Blyth, that the result is “very different” from the source material. “It’s not the game,” he says.</p> <p>That might immediately sound bad, because films that have wandered far from their original point tend to be aimless, meandering noise. But <em>Watch_Dogs</em> didn’t exactly have a memorable storyline, and is best remembered for its hacking within an all-consuming surveillance system, so ideally the film would lean successfully in this direction: thwarting the underground criminal world of Chicago through grey-hat hacking. It would have been great if it could have offered us this without fridging the protagonist’s niece at the start for some deeply lazy motivation, but there’s plenty there to serve as the basis for an action romp with a sci-fi edge.</p>

 <p>Blyth (speaking to&nbsp;<em>ScreenRant</em> about his current movie&nbsp;<em>Plainclothes</em>) expanded a little. “They’ve done an amazing job of making…I don’t want to spoil too much. I’m trying to pick my words carefully, but they’ve done an amazing job of making the game into a film. It feels very film. It doesn’t feel like they’ve tried to copy and paste the game onto the screen. It feels like its own thing, and it feels like the beginning of a world-building exercise.”</p>

 <p>It feels very film.</p> <p>Super-fans of the original game might be disappointed to not get a highly faithful cinematic retelling of it, but given <em>Watch_Dogs</em> released in 2014, the vast majority of people have forgotten the story entirely. An exciting movie set in the world of hacking, surveillance and untouched criminal networks sounds like it could entertain me well enough, should director Mathieu Turi do a half-decent job with it all. Turi is still something of an unknown quantity, having been AD on movies like <em>Inglorious Basterds</em> and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/united-passions/">infamously terrible</a>&nbsp;<em>United Passions</em>, with just 2020’s&nbsp;<em>Meander</em> seeing him succeed at the helm. (His other films have not troubled the attention of critics.)</p> <p>But, if nothing else, we know the&nbsp;<em>Watch_Dogs</em> movie feels, at the least, very film.</p>

              <p>Are you ready to pay more for <em>Bluey</em>? Disney thinks so. The company has announced it’s raising prices for a bunch of its subscription tiers <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-streaming-inside-out-price-hike-increase-when-1851614922">just a year after the last hike</a>. This reveal of the new streaming tax also comes just a day after the company announced Jimmy Kimmel <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-announces-jimmy-kimmel-return-tuesday-boycott-back-abc-not-canceled-2000627662">would be back on the air, sorta</a>, following calls for a boycott of all Disney products after his late-night show was indefinitely pulled.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-plus-hulu-espn-streaming-price-hikes-kimmel-2025.html">t</a><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-plus-hulu-espn-streaming-price-hikes-kimmel-2025.html">o <em>Vulture</em></a>, the new prices start a month from today on October 23. At that point, four of Disney’s subscription tiers will go up in price with the largest increase a whopping 20 percent. Here are the new prices:</p> <ul> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ and Hulu Bundle (with ads) – $13 a month (was $11)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ Premium (no ads) –&nbsp;$19 a month (was $16)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpfb0i00333b78zwbaf199@published" data-word-count="32">Disney+ (with ads)&nbsp;– $12 a month (was $10)</li> <li data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpflqj00383b78uboz5qhu@published" data-word-count="33">Hulu + Live TV (with ads) –&nbsp;$90 a month (was $87)</li> </ul> <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfwpflqj00383b78uboz5qhu@published" data-word-count="33">Not all of the prices are going up. The Disney+ and Hulu Premium Bundle without ads will still be $20 a month and Hulu Premium without adds will still be $19. Still, I mean, $90 a month for live TV? In this economy? Why did any of us bother cutting the cord in the first place?</p>

 <p>All entertainment is getting more expensive right now. The streaming wars might as well be called the pricing wars now, except that everyone’s racing to bump prices up instead of undercut one another. Disney’s price hikes come at a weird time, and not only because it just tossed the First Amendment in the trash to appease a sunsetting authoritarian president. There’s also just not a whole lot going on with the service right now outside of the ESPN bundle with fall sports. The next phase of the MCU is delayed, <em>Star Wars</em> is on a post-<em>Andor</em> hiatus until <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-trailer-reactions-2000627675"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em></a>, and even season four of <em>Bluey</em> is nowhere in sight. A feature-length movie adaptation of the hit Australian dog cartoon isn’t due until 2027.</p> <p>Simply put, if you only watch your local football team, whose games are free to watch on broadcast television, there’s simply never been a better time to ditch Disney+. Unless you are my son, who’s excited for Halloween and keeps hounding me to watch <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this year,<a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"> <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>,</a> the third entry in James Cameron’s blockbuster sci-fi saga, will arrive in theaters. And as that movie hits cinemas, a big new expansion related to the sci-fi sequel will launch for Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-open-world-ubisoft-far-cry-1851209744">overlooked<em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773">2023’s<em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a> is a solid open-world game that plays a lot like <em>Far Cry</em> and features a gorgeous alien jungle to explore as a giant blue cat person, aka a Navi warrior. While the game didn’t set the world on fire at launch, it has developed a loyal following of players and received some post-launch DLC and updates. And now Ubisoft has announced a whole new expansion for the under-the-radar game that will connect it directly to the next <em>Avatar</em> film.</p> <p>The upcoming DLC, <em>From the Ashes,</em> is set to launch on December 19 for consoles and PC alongside the new movie, which arrives on the same day in theaters. It will cost $20 for people who own the main game already, and Ubisoft plans to sell a $40 version that bundles the game and the expansion together for new players.</p>

 <p>Here’s the official trailer for the new expansion, as well as Ubisoft’s plot summary:</p> <blockquote><p>“<em>From the Ashes</em> sees players embark on the journey of So’lek, a battle-hardened Na’vi warrior from the Trr’ong clan. Ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and their new allies—the ruthless Ash clan—So’lek awakens to a world in flames and his Sarentu family scattered. Driven by grief and vengeance, he sets out to reunite with and protect his loved ones.”</p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>From the Ashes</em> takes place a few weeks after the events of the upcoming film<em> Fire and Ash</em> and roughly six months after <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> and both story packs,” the DLC’s creative director Omar Bouali <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie">explained to <em>IGN</em></a>. “<em>From the Ashes</em> is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest, which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines. It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we’ve worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of <em>Avatar</em> media are complementary.”</p> <p>Shortly before the launch of the third movie and this new DLC, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> will receive a big, free update. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-cheap-third-person-new-game-1851786644">As previously announced</a>, this new update will arrive on December 5 and add new game+ and a third-person camera option. Then two weeks later, this new DLC arrives. For fans of <em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, all 46 of you out there (myself included), this is some good news and a great way to end the year. Let’s just hope the DLC and new movie are good.</p>

The developer states that the game has "a more stable frame rate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay" on the PC handheld. </p><p dir="ltr">Larian detailed what's included with hotfix 34 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> in a set of patch notes, with the spotlight on the Steam Deck-native build.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Koijima Productions' Beyond the Strand presentation revealed a few new details for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">Physint</a>, the studio’s in-development action espionage title. Although studio head Hideo Kojima said earlier this year that the project was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">at least five years away from release</a>, he unveiled a piece of key art along with some of its celebrity voice talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima reiterates that Physint, which was first revealed during a January 2024 State of Play, is in the conceptual stages. However, he says the game’s technology will be more advanced than Kojima Productions' upcoming horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>. While we don’t see any in-game footage, Kojima revealed a Physint poster showing off the game’s protagonist.</p>

<p>While Kojima has not yet cast the main character, he does reveal three film actors playing unknown supporting roles: Charlee Fraser (<em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Anyone But You</em>), Ma Dong-seok AKA Don Lee (<em>Train to Busan, Eternals</em>), and Minami Hamabe (<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>). Kojima then shared images of Hamabe rendered in-engine, showing off the technology's impressive realism.&nbsp;</p><p>Physint has no release window, but it will be coming to PlayStation platforms (likely Sony's next-generation console).

<p>Sigils and Medals and Scrolls, oh my!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are rapidly approaching the <strong>30th October</strong> release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, and to drum up the hype in the remaining weeks, Square Enix has released yet another new trailer.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-overview-trailer">gameplay-focused</a> affair that arrived earlier this month, the fresh trailer is all about highlighting the games' new features. The four-minute trailer provides a pretty comprehensive breakdown of everything we can expect, from bonus characters and story content to additional gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>We'd recommend watching the above trailer for the full rundown, but, in short, here are the highlights. DQ2's Sigils now crop up in both games and are "vital to the story" of each, with Scrolls and Mini Medals also making an appearance. We get a closer look at the second game's new 'Ocean Floor' expansion, with its fresh wave of enemies, storylines, and 'Memories of the World' collectibles. There's also a rundown of the game's new character, the Princess of Cannock, and bonus Tombola minigame — maybe not the big addition <em>we</em> would have ended the trailer on, but what can you do?</p>
<p>All in all, it's still looking rather wonderful. The absence of a Switch 2 upgrade path sours the package somewhat, but if the end result can match last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> in terms of sheer joy, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-debuts-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-%E2%80%93-from-the-ashes-expansion-arriving-december-2025.1305615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft announced that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting an expansion titled From the Ashes, arriving on all platforms on December 19, 2025. The expansion brings players back to Pandora to a section of its western front and places them in a new story that is arriving the same day as the release of the next film in James Cameron's cinematic series, Avatar: Fire and Ash.</p>



<p>You can tell by the trailer that the tone of this expansion is darker than the story of the base game, and according to Ubisoft it'll even take advantage of features soon to be implemented in the game, namely the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/">third-person mode due to arrive on December 5, 2025</a>, two weeks ahead of the expansion's release.</p>



<p>From the Ashes follows So'lek on a revenge mission after the Ash clan teamed up with the RDA, ambushing him and his fellow Sarentu Na'vi. When he wakes up after the attack, his rage takes him on a destructive path to try to save his family and deliver justice to his enemies.</p>



<p>"<em>With From the Ashes, we wanted to push the boundaries of what players can experience on Pandora</em>," said Omar Bouali, Massive Entertainment's creative director, in a press release. "<em>This expansion delivers a darker, more personal story, enhanced immersion via both the first and third-person gameplay</em>, <em>and intense new combat mechanics that deepen the emotional and tactical stakes. We wanted to offer fans a thrilling new perspective on the Western Frontier, with deeper storytelling and more visceral gameplay</em>."</p>

<iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes: EXPANSION REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24Lc7E-Vt80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Executive vice president of franchise development at Lightstorm Entertainment (the production company founded by James Cameron), Josua Izzo, added, "<em>Our partnership with Massive Entertainment has allowed us to expand this universe in bold new ways with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This new expansion, From the Ashes, will release at the same day as the theatrical release for Avatar: Fire and Ash - a film that explores darker corners of Pandora and introduces the formidable Ash People - we're equally excited for Avatar fans to experience untold stories through new interactive adventures</em>."</p>



<p>So basically, you can head to your local cinema to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash when it premieres, and then jump into the From the Ashes expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on your PC or console when you get home.</p>



<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to experience this new chapter in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,</em>" continued Luigi Priore, vice president and general manager of Disney and Pixar Games. "<em>From the Ashes continues the journey of Na'vi resistance warrior So'lek and demonstrates how Disney and Pixar Games works with our collaborators to craft wholly original stories grounded in the worlds they love</em>."</p>



<p>The expansion will be available for $24.99 USD, though if you don't already own Frontiers of Pandora, you'll be able to grab the expansion and the base game in a bundled 'From the Ashes' edition for $39.99.</p>

      <div><p>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter campaign is live now. This official card game set in the dystopian metropolis of Night City, developed by Night Crew Games, is packed with cards and characters that fans know and love. So much so, the project was funded in under an hour.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyberpunklegends/cyberpunk-legends-into-the-night/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is light on text, but packed with detail. As mentioned before, during its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement in June</a>, the game is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Each player chooses one of four roles: Netrunner, Solo, Nomad, or Rocker, and works together doing jobs, getting paid, chippin' in with cyberware, and improving themselves via RPG-lite mechanics.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-legends-kickstarter-add-on-promo-image.jpg?itok=XD2DGJbi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-legends-kickstarter-add-on-promo-image.jpg?itok=qRO7Fw38 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For fans of the Cyberpunk TTRPG setting, the game takes place in 2020, the era home to the biggest names of Night City like Morgan Blackhand, Rache Bartmoss, and Johnny Silverhand. The game will allow players to live out history in this dark sci-fi future. A history that leads to the Time of the Red in the TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a> anime and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> video game.</p>

<p>Because of this potent setting, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is packed with campaign-exclusive add-ons and stretch goals. These include story cards featuring the Bozos Gang, card sleeves, themed deck boxes, and playable versions of Night City legends before they became legends like Santiago and Kerry Eurodyne.</p>

<p>In addition, certain add-ons will let you create your own scenarios and custom character art. If you have especially deep pockets, you can even immortalize your own <em>Cyberpunk</em> character by having a drink at the Kernal Bar named after them.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers of the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Base Runner for $50:</strong> The base version of the game with all unlocked physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Legendary Edition for $130:</strong> The Legendary Edition of the game (which includes all add-on cards and playable Santiago, Bartmoss, Santiago, and Blackhand character decks) and all physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Guns and Clowns for $75:</strong> The base game and the Weapons, Bozos, and Cyberware card add-ons</li>
	<li><strong>Silverhand Special for $210:</strong> Everything in the Legendary Edition tier, the Hard Mon add-on, four sets of card sleeves, two deck boxes, and a play mat</li>
	<li><strong>Fixer's Edition for $350:</strong> Everything in the Silverhand Special tier, and the ability to play the first scenario of the game with the design team through Tabletop Simulator.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Chrome for $500:</strong> Everything from the Silverhand Special tier, plus all cards in the game get a foil treatment</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$201,420, which is almost three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. The campaign concludes on October 23.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-hits-on-the-hell-and-hilarity-of-hiking.1305609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are only two things that Nate really wants to do: use the toilet (one that, he emphasizes, comes with three walls and a door) and go home. He also walks with a strange gait, with one tiny foot raised awkwardly in front of the other, before landing with a gentle plop. At times, he teeters to one side, nearly off balance, as he strives to hike up a very tall, steep, and seemingly belligerent mountain. Nate’s a ragdoll barely held together by a severely compromised musculoskeletal system, powered by a deep-seated urge to trudge toward an outhouse.</p><p>Nate is also you. The incongruity of the tedium of hiking, an activity he perennially curses, and the earnestness of hiking culture makes the comedy of <em>Baby Steps</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam">an open-world exploration game from a trio of indie developers, including <em>QWOP</em> designer Bennett Foddy</a> — surprisingly cathartic. Its hilarity is drawn from the harrowing experiences of a reluctant, athletically challenged hiker. Every step has to be micromanaged. Walk too quickly and you can lose your balance; miscalculate the size of your stride and you will probably tumble off a cliff. Then there are the fellow hikers you meet along the way, and the contrast between Nate’s awkward, morose outlook versus their unbridled enthusiasm for clambering over dirt and rocks is sublime.</p><p>Thus, there’s a nearly perverse dimension to hiking that <em>Baby Steps</em> instinctively understands: it’s really exhausting for the innately clumsy.</p><p>Even walking in <em>Baby Steps</em> is laborious. This involves pressing a button to gradually lift up one leg, another button to hoist the other leg up, and directional keys that will see Nate putting his weight — or leaning toward — a specific point. It will take you a while to get used to this cadence, and making this even more hilariously frustrating is that Nate possesses none of the upper body strength that most people have. Forget using your hands to break your fall or scramble over small boulders; Nate’s floppy arms will do no work and carry no weight. It’s all part of what <em>Baby Steps</em> proudly presents as “fully-simulated physics based walking,” geared toward encouraging sheer buffoonery.</p><p>Beyond just walking, <em>Baby Steps</em> doesn’t give you any sort of goals, aside from heading to the next campsite. This means you can saunter to wherever takes your fancy, be it strutting toward a crumbling tower or climbing a small hill just to see what’s at its peak. Unlike the goal-driven structure of traditional games, <em>Baby Steps</em> offers neither quests nor rewards for your trek. The game also eschews the staples of open-world games with massive maps, such as fast travel, mini maps, and upgradeable gear — features that will ease your traversal from one point to the next.</p><p>You can, of course, make your way toward the end with minimal detours, but this approach will make <em>Baby Steps</em> feel very banal, very quickly. To enjoy what <em>Baby Steps</em> has to offer, then, is to find a point in its hike even when there’s no discernible point at all. In a way, it’s a game that offers one of the purest expressions of hiking. Any hiking enthusiast will talk your ears off about how the process <em>is </em>the point: you’re here to take in the sights of the trail, to marinate in the beauty of the wilderness, and to dirty your feet trudging across some of the muddiest terrains in existence.</p><p>Even as an avowed hiking skeptic, I can’t help but grudgingly agree with this perspective; <em>Baby Steps</em> does have many sights worth slogging for. Littered across its landscapes are several trees bearing glowing fruits, which you can pick — and noisily devour — if you can reach them. There are several non-collectible hats to discover, which you can plonk on your head gingerly. Unfortunately, these can easily go missing if you fall from a great height; I’ve lost many precious hats in my own perilous journey. Then there are the items you can find and return to their owners. Chancing upon these make up some of the most memorable events of my hike.</p><p>In my first playthrough, I found a set of keys while breaking into a seemingly abandoned hut (just another regular hiking activity), but Nate’s less-than-stellar grip strength means that he has a tendency to drop the item whenever he trips over his own feet. This led me on an extensive wild goose chase as I sought to retrieve the keys: painstakingly search through a grassy field, scramble around the rocky chasm of a pit, and waddle after the offending item as it floats down a river. I did lose the keys in the end, but all the scouting led me to discover several landmarks and other delectable secrets. I won’t spoil what they are for you.</p><p>Beneath the absurd slapstick of <em>Baby Steps</em>, however, lies an axiom that many hiking detractors have known for ages: hiking is hell. The more Nate walks, the more soiled his onesie gets. The soles of his bare feet are stained with an indelible brown, and he sometimes lays on his back with a defeated sigh after suffering a spectacular fall. It’s how the game stands out from the burgeoning genre of hiking simulators like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Death Stranding</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/18/20804152/a-short-hike-review-animal-crossing-zelda-steam-itchio">A Short Hike</a>,</em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10922560/firewatch-review-ps4-pc">Firewatch</a> </em>— titles that depict the activity as a meditative, serene experience.</p><p>But in <em>Baby Steps</em>, you aren’t just traversing treacherous environments, but also getting around with your own ramshackle body. Your legs betray your exhaustion; your head screams as you make another agonizing misstep. It’s a hiking experience that reflects the reality of folks who lose their motor skills when faced with the prospect of climbing up yet another craggy hill.</p><p><sub>Baby Steps <em>launches on September 23rd on the PS5 and Steam.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTI4Mg=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Khee Hoon Chan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/783549/baby-steps-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The era of Google's Play's unrivaled dominance may be coming to an end in the wake of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">antitrust loss</a>, but Google's app store isn't going anywhere. In fact, the Play Store experience is getting a massive update with more personalization, content, and yes, AI. This is Google, after all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/">revamped Google Play Games</a> is a key part of this update. Gamer profiles will now have a public face, allowing you to interact with other players if you choose. Play Games will track your activity for daily streaks, which will be shown on your profile and unlock new Play Points rewards. Your profile will also display your in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Your gaming exploits can also span multiple platforms. Google Play Games for PC is officially leaving beta. Google says there are now 200,000 games that work across mobile and PC, and even more PC-friendly titles, like <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, are on the way. Your stats and streaks will apply across both mobile and PC as long as the title comes from the Play Store.</p>
<p>At the core of Google's app store revamp is the You Tab, which will soon take its place in the main navigation bar of the Play Store. This page will show your rewards, subscriptions, game, stats, and more—and it goes beyond gaming. The You Tab will recommend a variety of content on Google Play, including books and podcasts.</p>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/radical-repetition">finally made the leap from Apple Arcade to consoles last year</a>, takes several cues from Hades, but wraps it in the shells of Eastman and Laird's iconic Turtles. Earlier this year, the mask-wearing Casey Jones joined the playable roster of characters in the isometric roguelike, and now, it's Metalhead's turn.</p><p>A robotic turtle built by Donatello, Metalhead is the sixth playable character and delivers an all-new playstyle to the game. He operates as the longest-range character on the roster to date, with a laser gun, explosive landmines, and tactical skills designed to keep enemies at a distance. The story introduces Metalhead by having him accidentally open a rift under a pizzeria, and it's up to the team to stop the chaos that spills out of the rift. Additionally, the paid DLC adds five new artifacts to let you further experiment with your builds.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the paid Metalhead DLC, all players will have access to a free title update that adds an Arcade mode, new levels, a new storyline, additional powers, enemies, visual upgrades, and tuning. Arcade mode offers a fast-paced way to experience the content alone or with friends, complete with a new Hex and Flex system, which adds new variables to account for during a run; some combos you unlock will weaken you (Hexes), while others will make you stronger (Flexes). The update also adds three new biomes – the Spectral Sewers, Astral Ship, and Manic Metropolis – a new Wraith enemy set, and Enemy Invasion mechanics that unlock new encounter combinations. These updates stack with more than 100 gameplay and quality-of-life improvements, including visual polish and balancing adjustments.</p><p>Both the Metalhead paid DLC and the free update hit all versions on September 30.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1m-on-steam-not-counting-dl2-users.1305585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/dying-light-the-beast-hades-and-so?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#media-82268893-9e3f-41e4-9121-2afef3744476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Alinea Analytics newsletter</a>, Dying Light: The Beast has sold over a million units on Steam and over a million and a half overall. </p>



<p>You might recall that Polish developer Techland had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> of having received a million pre-orders even before launch. However, that figure included Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition users; since Dying Light: The Beast started its life as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, Ultimate Edition users are still entitled to it as originally promised by the studio. Now, though, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics tells me the game has actually sold one million new copies on Valve's platform. The newsletter also says that, as you would expect, 82% of the players played the original Dying Light, and 77% played the sequel. That is to say, especially early on, dedicated fans have returned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast topped Steam's weekly sales, but the other big titles released earlier this month continued to do well. Borderlands 4 added 337K units to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its previous two million units</a>. Hollow Knight: Silksong sold another 255K on top of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">existing five million units</a>, and other indie games like Peak and Shape of Dreams also continued to do very well. </p>



<p>No, I’m Not Human, a freshly released first-person horror visual novel from Trioskaz, sold over 200K copies on its debut week. Jump Space, <a href="https://wccftech.com/jump-space-gamescom-2025-qa-little-bit-hazelight-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sci-fi cooperative space adventure game from Keepsake</a>, also had a great early access launch week, topping even EA Sports FC 26 (at least on Steam).</p>



<p>Another game that did well last week was Hades, which sold over 150K units (crossing the nine million units milestone) thanks to a 75% discount. Supergiant timed it right in advance of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 launch of Hades 2</a>, and Alinea Analytics reckons this will be the next big hit on Steam. The game has already sold over two million copies in early access, so there's a solid chance it will land around two million daily active users when it launches in two days.</p>



<p>As a side note, according to Alinea's estimates, Palworld has surpassed 25 million copies across all platforms. Incidentally, PocketPair has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-palfarm-farming-game-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the spin-off farming game Palworld: Palfarm.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/painkiller-revival-slightly-delayed-new-rougelike-mode-gameplay-trailer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-remake-officially-set-for-october-9-launch/">announcing</a> that the Painkiller revival from publisher 3D Realms and developer Anshar Studios would arrive on October 9, the game's arrival has been slightly pushed back a little more than a week into October to now launch on October 21, 2025. Alongside the reveal, we also got another action-packed trailer for the classic FPS game's comeback that makes it seem like it'll be worth the extra wait.</p>



<p>The Rogue Angel trailer features a look at a new roguelike mode that'll be included in the game when it arrives on October 21, adding more for players to do on top of the game's campaign mode, which will be playable solo or for the first time with the arrival of this new title, in a three-player co-op mode. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new mode takes players into a new realm of Purgatory, with procedurally generated arenas, new upgrades to make you and your teammates even stronger, and seemingly endless hordes of demons to shoot.</p>



<p>Initially announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/">March of this year</a>, this Painkiller revival brings the original 2004 shooter from Outriders and Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly back to the forefront, asking players to jump back into the boots of those condemned to Purgatory to try and escape your prison and redeem yourself for your own salvation.</p>



<p>Which is all just a backdrop to go shoot hordes and hordes of demons in some fast-paced FPS fun. Now with a roguelike mode to boot.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a> is a bit of an alarming game to look at. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game is so clearly an anime-esque riff on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA</a>, with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Spider-Man</a> style web swinging thrown in for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. All of that's been obviously more or less since its announcement. But the game just received its first gameplay trailer at Tokyo Game Show, and it looks scarily… expensive.
</p>
<p>
Through the roughly seven minutes of gameplay, set to a song I can only describe as "song you let play on the radio while driving just because you want to fill the silence," more and more Things just kept happening. One minute the main character is driving a motorbike, the next they're taking a selfie through different scenes, one of which shows a mostly naked man escaping police on a robotic, walking toilet, and then the next they're fighting goons Yakuza-style in the street.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYejjuRrLzw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
And more things keep happening after that! There's the aforementioned Spider-Man swinging, a giant city-destroying robot, and just so many fictitious shops with such well realised branding you could convince me I could actually visit them. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't even mentioning the fact that Ananta just wholesale rips off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s character transition, letting you hop into another, presumably gacha rolled, character's body, continuing on whatever they're doing. There's even quite an interesting use of this where you can do so while you're being held at gunpoint, with the switch to another character allowing you to snipe enemies from afar.
</p><p>
It really has that GTA ethos of "you can do everything," an ethos I don't necessarily feel great about considering the amount of labour likely required to achieve it, which raises questions of how ethical that labour was achieved. There's a chance it's teetering on the edge of having too much to do the do, to the point it becomes overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Ananta isn't just alarming because of how much of an "everything" game it presents itself as, but because I have some reservations about its narrative framing. The main character is the new captain of a special task force, essentially what seems to be the police. There's even a moment about halfway through where, as a different character, you can just handcuff and arrest an NPC.
</p>
<p>
Of course you can have games where you play as the police, there are good and interesting stories about police too, but I can't help but feel a bit concerned by such a, potentially small, gameplay feature. There's no amount of cute half-animal anime women that can make it easy to breeze past such a thing.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a game to be curious but cautious about, whenever it comes out.

              <p><span>Do you guys think </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401"><span>Donald Trump</span></a><span> might have some kind of humiliation kink? Is someone with such a myopic view of the world, enabled by all the yes-men in his corner and the cult-like following of his supporters, even capable of perceiving embarrassment? Well, if the last 79 years of the businessman-and-reality-star-turned-U.S.-president’s life weren’t embarrassing enough, his press conference yesterday, September 22, in which he </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/health/trump-autism-announcement-cause-tylenol"><span>tried to link autism to taking Tylenol during pregnancy</span></a><span>, with zero scientific evidence or backing, would be enough to haunt the average self-aware person for the rest of their days. But for those of us who watched the president dribble out this absolute nonsense, it was a tremendous day to post.</span></p>  <p><span>If you want to watch the hour-long press conference in which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>Trump</span></a><span> attributes a condition first recognized in 1912 to a pain medication that was introduced in 1955, it’s right here, but you will likely find the most interesting bits clipped on social media. Some highlights include Trump saying nonsense like “Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen,” and his being unable to pronounce acetaminophen. But to summarize, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980"><span>Trump</span></a><span> and his merry band of misfits allege that if someone takes Tylenol while pregnant, their baby could pop out with the uncanny ability to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>remember the names of all 1000+ Pokémon</span></a><span>. He says that pregnant people should avoid Tylenol at all costs “unless medically necessary.” You know, “if you can’t tough it out.” Notably, the conference constantly name-drops Tylenol, which is Kenvue’s brand name for over-the-counter acetaminophen, rather than more widely attributing this fake science to acetaminophen itself.

The latest, Hotfix #34, is a juicy one. It adds a native Steam Deck build and should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas such as the Lower City in Act 3 across all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-has-slowdown-issues-because-it-keeps-thinking-about-all-your-theft-and-violence">Baldur's Gate 3 Act 3 is infamous for its performance issues</a>. Indeed it was one of the tougher areas to navigate, especially in the months after the game launched and before Larian issued various updates, mainly due to the sheer number of NPCs who mill about on-screen and everything the game has to consider as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, Larian said the native Steam Deck build means Baldur’s Gate 3 has a more stable framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay on Valve’s handheld. But the work done for this build benefits all players by improving the way the game's models are streamed across all platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Hotfix #34 addresses “some rather annoying” instances of crashing on Xbox, Larian said. And as is Larian’s way, it sprinkled the patch notes, below, with some trademark flair. For example:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed the audio levels for a rat in the Lower City that you, tragically, couldn't hear squeak when it squoke.</li><li>Reminded Halsin to actually yell when he gains barbarian Rage instead of silently miming it.</li><li>Told one of the imps on the nautiloid to stop looking in the wrong direction.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-baldurs-gate-3-turns-2-larian-boss-swen-vincke-talks-about-the-studios-next-game-and-asks-fans-for-their-patience-well-need-a-bit-of-time-to-make-it-all-work">Baldur’s Gate 3 celebrated its two-year anniversary last month</a>, with Larian boss Swen Vincke discussing how its enormous success paved the way for the studio to work on its hotly-anticipated next game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records. Its wild success was a game-changer for Larian, and the title has continued to perform strongly in the two years since launch, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG, especially on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel.

From the Ashes will be available on December 19 – the same day as Cameron's upcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash film – for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Ubisoft+, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect. It will be priced at $24.99 for players who already own the base game. Alternatively, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes Edition will include the full game and this story expansion and be available on the same platforms for $39.99. Watch the announcement trailer above and check out the first screenshots from the expansion in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the Ashes takes place a few weeks after the events of the upcoming film Fire and Ash and roughly six months after Frontiers of Pandora and both story packs," Omar Bouali, the creative director on the project, told IGN. "From the Ashes is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines. It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we’ve worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of Avatar media are complementary."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft described From the Ashes' plot as such: "From the Ashes sees players embark on the journey of So’lek, a battle-hardened Na’vi warrior from the Trr’ong clan. Ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and their new allies—the ruthless Ash clan—So’lek awakens to a world in flames and his Sarentu family scattered. Driven by grief and vengeance, he sets out to reunite with and protect his loved ones."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to what we might see in both this story expansion and the upcoming movie, Bouali said, "We have been able to share some elements across both pieces of media – the most obvious being the Mangkawn, otherwise known as the Ash Clan, but also the Wind Traders who appeared first in our game but will also appear in Fire and Ash. There’s also one very special creature that will appear in both our game and Fire and Ash that we’re very excited for fans to discover. So yes, without revealing too much, it is a process of strong collaboration and we each have been able to share and contribute in an organic, complementary way to ensure fans get an authentic and consistent experience across both the expansion and film."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN called Frontiers of Pandora "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review">good</a>" when it released almost two years ago.

                <p>Ubisoft's classic platforming series Rayman celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this month. The developer confirmed the next mainline entry is in the works, but it sounds like it's a long ways off. While that's probably not what fans wanted to hear, at least you can buy a brand-new version of Rayman for Game Boy Color. That sentence sounds odd, but it's true: Ubisoft partnered with <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ModRetro to rerelease the GBC version</a> of the original Rayman. An <em>actual </em>GBC cartridge, in fact, and it looks lovely.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573008-rayman30thanniversarymodretrochromatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573008" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573008-rayman30thanniversarymodretrochromatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573008"></a><figcaption>Rayman for ModRetro Chromatic / Game Boy Color</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573008-rayman30thanniversarymodretrochromatic.jpg"></figure><p>Rayman is the latest addition to the ModRetro Chromatic Classics Collection. If the words ModRetro Chromatic don't mean anything to you: ModRetro is a retro gaming hardware manufacturer and software publisher; the Chromatic, an exceedingly impressive recreation of the Game Boy Color, was the brand's debut product last year. Check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/" data-ref-id="1100-6528473">our in-depth Chromatic review</a> published at launch. Just a heads up, though: The Chromatic we reviewed now retails for $299, and the $199 model has slightly different components. That said, you can still get the <a href="https://sovrn.co/q6fov18" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop-exclusive gray launch edition bundled with Tetris</a> for $199.</p><p>It's important to note that even though ModRetro carts have Chromatic branding, all of them work on original hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket. ModRetro sent me a Rayman demo cart, and I tested it on Chromatic, Pocket, and an original Game Boy Color. It played perfectly on all three.</p><p>The Chromatic edition of Rayman is largely the same as the original, but it does include a great new soundtrack. Like many GBC games, Rayman had a clear cartridge, whereas the Chromatic edition matches the hero's purple shirt. The box and label art match the original North American release. The glossy cardboard box has a removable plastic tray that holds the cart in place and an instruction booklet, just like the old days. When you remove the cart from the tray, you'll find the small Rayman charm shown below. Every ModRetro game includes a charm themed around the game, which is a nice little touch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573031-raymanchromatic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573031" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573031-raymanchromatic2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573031"></a><figcaption>Exclusive Rayman charm</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573031-raymanchromatic2.jpg"></figure><p>Rayman remains one of the better platformers on GBC. It's one of many Game Boy games that is based on a console edition, yet is essentially a new game. It shares the same overarching plot, but the levels are different and many of the characters from the 1995 original aren't present. This is by no means a barebones experience, though. Rayman on GBC has over 30 levels spread across seven main biomes and endgame challenge worlds. The colorful sprites and environments still hold up, too. It's definitely worth playing, and if you have access to a device that plays GBC carts, ModRetro's rerelease is an ideal choice.</p><p>It would've been easy to mistakenly think you already played this game on PlayStation, Sega Saturn, or Atari Jaguar. Everyone played Rayman on Jaguar, of course. It probably didn't help matters that a real port of Rayman launched on Game Boy Advance barely over a year after the GBC release. Rayman Advance, by the way, is one of the prettiest Game Boy Advance games ever made, which is quite impressive since it was a launch title. In short: Early Rayman handheld games were awesome and remain awesome today.</p><p>Outside of the Chromatic edition of Tetris, which is bundled with the handheld and isn't sold separately, Rayman is the "biggest" game in <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games?filter.p.m.custom.release_type=Re-Released+Classic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ModRetro's Classics Collection</a>. It joins Toki Tori Ultimate Edition, Sabrina: Zapped, Baby T-Rex, and Project S-11.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573043-raymanchromatic4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573043" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573043-raymanchromatic4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573043"></a><figcaption>Rayman on ModRetro Chromatic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4573043-raymanchromatic4.jpg"></figure>
