            <p>Double Fine's PsychOdyssey is a 32-part documentary series which charts the creation of 2021 platformer Psychonauts 2, from initial brainstorming sessions to its final release. Or it was - now it's 33 parts, as a new 94-minute episode was just released which looks back at the game, its reception, and the release of the documentary itself.

<p>If you have any interest in video game development at all, you owe it to yourself to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fines-new-documentary-about-making-psychonauts-2-is-a-must-watch">watch the documentary from the beginning</a>. Even if you don't care about development or video games, I think it would be compelling to watch a team of sincere, talented people collaborate to make something complicated and joyful. Its to Double Fine's great credit that the documentary frankly depicts several of the things that went wrong on the project, too, from staff disagreements, departures, crunch, and much more.
</p>
<p>This latest episode looks back on those challenges with the benefit of hindsight, first through a series of post-mortem meetings held at Double Fine after Psychonauts 2's release, and then through the lens of the documentary's release. That includes discussion of some of the doc's most dramatic moments, such as the fallout (and fallings out) that followed the hiring and eventual departure of Psychonauts 2's original project lead.
</p>
<p>Double Fine haven't announced a new game in the three years since Psychonauts 2 was released, and there's some discussion of what might be next from the now Microsoft-owned studio. In broad strokes: a return to smaller games, and a doubling-down on being weird, with the ambition of making the weirdest games on Game Pass. </p>

Those against SBMM argue that since there are ranked playlists, those who want to be matched with players of equal skill can simply play there, leaving the rest of the game's modes open to a more luck-of-the-draw-type of matchmaking experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 5 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">From the blog post, it doesn't seem like Call of Duty will ditch SBMM any time soon, largely because the developers have revealed they have solid data on the effects doing so would have on the game. In a test conducted with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 where one group of players played with the current SBMM rules and another group that played under "loosened skill consideration," the developers found that the group playing with a wider skill gap were "more likely to quit matches in progress and did not return to the game at a higher rate than players with unchanged matchmaking."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also ran another test where skill requirements in matchmaking were actually increased. It had the opposite effect, with players more likely to finish a match, particularly when it came to low-skill players. However, the developer notes that high-skill players were impacted in some negative ways by the stricter skill requirements, and as a result, the changes were not rolled out to the live game.</p><p dir="ltr">"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches," the developer states. "Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels."</p><p dir="ltr">Should low-skill players leave the game in droves due to being frustrated by blowout matches, it creates an environment where lobbies are largely made up of high-skill players, something the developer states is the case when players go back and play many older Call of Duty titles today.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience," the developer states." A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-patch-notes/2900-5631/" data-ref-id="2900-5631">Modern Warfare 3 Season 5 just launched, adding new maps, modes, and weapons</a> to the popular FPS, just in time for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month-report/1100-6524827/" data-ref-id="1100-6524827">arrival on Xbox Game Pass</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 and will be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">launch day for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p>

			<p>Look North World is a pioneering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">UGC (User Generated Content)</a> game studio and published led by Alexander Seropian, the founder of Bungie and a former executive at Disney have announced that they have managed to raise a total of $4.5M for seed funding. The second round of fundraising for seed funding had contributions from London Venture Partners, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Hasbro, and many more.</p>
<p>Along with the seed funding, Look North World has announced the launch of its Creator Label, a curated program dedicated to supporting and boosting individual creators who build on creative platforms. In total, 15 games are being created with major IP deals, allowing Look North World to invest in accelerating the creation of original games using UGC.</p>
<p>Using the Creator Label, Look North World aims to provide end-to-end support for creators in the UGC gaming sphere. Creators signed to the label will receive guaranteed benefits, such as an advance, long-term ownership of intellectual property, a marketing budget to distribute their contributions, and a team of industry professionals who can help with artistic and technical support.</p>
<p>So far, the first signed content creators to the label are Austin 'TomJank' Rodriguez and Jon 'SightedSloth' Jungemann. TomJank is known for creating Dream Job Tycoon, and SleightedSloth has worked on various tycoon games across the Epic Games Store creation applications.</p>
<p>"Investing in Look North World cements our belief in user-generated content being a core pillar of the future of gaming. As UGC platforms expand and gain market share, talented teams are leveraging them to push boundaries and create diverse, immersive experiences at an unprecedented pace. We invest in people, and Alex and his veteran team are pioneers, notably during previous growth waves of console and mobile. With Look North World they continue to reshape how games are built and published," says Matt Bilbey, Venture Partner at London Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Look North World has a<a href="https://looknorth.world/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> selection of games</a> available at the moment, such as Dream Job Tycoon on Fortnite, the Ark Survival Ascended x Power Rangers Cosmetic Pack, Carrera Coast, Outlaw Corral, and Don't Push the Button, which are all available in Fortnite.</p>
<p>"Look North World is a great partner for the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund, as a company with a foundation of game making know-how and founders who have created blockbusters in traditional games now looking to apply their pedigree and vision to what the new generation of gamers want to play," said Yoyo Yang, Principal of the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-wipe-coming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s a matter of weeks until Escape from Tarkov ‘wipes’, with Battlestate Games pushing out that regular platform-wide reset that takes everyone back to level pegging. It’s typically one of the most exciting times to be an Escape from Tarkov player, as it usually goes hand-in-hand with sizeable in-game updates such as new maps, weapons, bosses, and quests.</p>



<p>Today, a new event started in Escape from Tarkov – the type of special event that usually takes place <strong>very close </strong>to a wipe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-going-to-wipe">When is Tarkov Going to Wipe?</h2>



<p>We don’t know when Escape from Tarkov will wipe next – all we know is that it’s happening at some point in August.</p>



<p>Today, Battlestate Games deployed a new in-game event to take players one step closer to the next wipe. At the core of this event sits free entry to Labs, arguably the toughest Escape from Tarkov map and a haven for skilled PvPers. Once you’ve gained entry to Labs, you’ll need to complete a strange task handed out by Jaeger. He wants you to kill 23 PMCs and 57 Raiders – there’s a hefty prize for doing so, but it’s a pretty massive ask for the less talented players.</p>



<p>This event runs until July 29, and it’s following on from a recent limited-time quest that saw two traders – Prapor and Peacekeeper – pitted against one another. Traditionally, this won’t be the last special event before a wipe arrives. The best indicator of that is a sudden change to the in-game stores and traders, with the prices for everything going down to a single rouble or so and all the trader ‘rep levels’ being boosted to the maximum tier.</p>



<p>That means that you’ll be able to build the best weapons, secure top armour, and go into battles fully loaded – but then typically the game will wipe just days later. </p>



<p>Be prepared – Escape from Tarkov is wiping soon.</p>

But there are some key differences between the PC version and this console port.</p><p>On PC, hip-fire is Valorant's primary shooting mode, and aim-down-sights (ADS) is a secondary, supporting mode. For the console port, Riot created Focus, a new shooting mode that functions much like hip-fire but with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft said Valorant on console lets players shoot from the hip whenever they need speed in moving both their camera and aim (think: peeking around corners and dodging) but with the ability to utilize Focus mode whenever they need to pull off a precise, calibrated headshot.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/ae8fccdc-a995-46d7-8d56-41ad4c97c364-160644d4448761a79945-1722010559172.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Valorant on Xbox Series X. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Some of the Agent abilities have been adapted for the new input controls, and various tunings across the board have all contributed to the team’s number one priority: capturing the dynamic pacing and mechanically expressive feel of the original," Microsoft continued.</p><p>Because of this difference, Valorant does not feature crossplay between PC and console (crossplay <em>is</em> available between PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). "This is primarily due to a focus on maintaining the title’s competitive integrity, given the control changes required to bring the game to console," Microsoft explained.</p><p>There is, however, shared cross-progression across PC and console, which means your inventory carries over. So, if you unlock skins on PC or console, they’ll work across the two. Similarly, battle pass progression carries across both versions.</p><p>The open beta comes ahead of the full console launch, which on Xbox includes bonuses for Game Pass subscribers. In the open beta and the full launch, Game Pass members unlock every Agent released so far, as well as any new additions on day one.
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In addition to console ports, Riot announced in 2021 that it is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile">working on a mobile version of Valorant</a>. Riot promised that the mobile version would provide "the same competitive Valorant experience" currently available on PC. However, news on this version has been scarce since its initial announcement.</p><p>Last October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-12/how-influencers-helped-riot-games-turn-valorant-into-a-gen-z-hit?srnd=premium&amp;leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Valorant had 28 million monthly players, with 70% of the player-base belonging to Gen Z.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-review">our review of Valorant</a>, IGN wrote: "Valorant is a clever tactical hero shooter that's plenty deep and a lot of fun to master."</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

She had died over a thousand times (accounting for both screens), and 35% of her deaths were due to Radahn's gravity attack.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I first encountered <a href="https://arranger.quest/"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a> at the Netflix booth during Summer Game Fest. Within moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">of settling in with the demo</a>, I was struck by the game’s clarity of conceit and purpose. You’re a little girl named Jemma, who, as she moves across a tiled world of columns and rows, moves objects with her. Puzzle shenanigans involving&nbsp;— if you’ll pardon the pun — <em>arranging</em> objects will undoubtedly ensue.</p><p><em>Arranger </em>is an “Oh... <em>oh</em>!” kind of puzzle game. It is deceptively simple, with clear objectives no more complicated than “use the pressure switch to unlock the door.” But the game’s simplicity of presentation obscures cleverly designed puzzles that tested my spatial awareness to its absolute limit, and I <em>loved</em> every second of it.&nbsp;</p><div><p>That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often</p></div><p>Early in the game, I was in an empty room with a pressure plate and a blocked door. Standing on the plate naturally unblocked the door, but when I moved off the plate, it slammed shut in my face. I tried every which way of <em>arranging</em> (sorry, this is gonna happen a lot) myself, thinking I could quickly hop off the plate and into the open door before it shut —but to no avail. Frustrated, I went back out the way I came thinking I’d missed some key item from an NPC, and by the doorway… there were two potted plants.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>Before I entered that room, those potted plants were a throwaway decoration. Coming out, I immediately gleaned their purpose. Playing <em>Arranger</em> feels like the first time a baby discovers that the square block goes into the square hole. That’s not to say the game is too easy; rather, it’s like you can feel yourself learning a new thing in real time. That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often.</p><p>When I’m playing, the click of the tiles as Jemma moves gets slower as I mutter “I think I got this” the closer I get to the objective. I know what has to happen. To beat this centipede boss, I must shove its spiky tail into its eye, but for every tile the tail gets closer, the eye moves a tile away like in a game of <em>Snake.</em> But there are stones in the boss arena, and I can wedge the centipede around the stones and...</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>As rewarding as those moments are, though, they also work in reverse. The game’s antagonist is an affliction called “the static.” Objects affected by it essentially act as barriers. Jemma can’t move them the way she can other things, so if they’re in her way, she has to figure out a way to go around them. The static also spawns path-blocking monsters that can only be defeated if you push a sword into its space. A lot of <em>Arranger</em>’s puzzles involve moving a sword, Jemma, or mission-critical items around “static’d” objects.</p><div><figcaption><em>Combat in </em>Arranger<em> involves moving swords around and pushing them into enemies.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>In one puzzle, I had to reassemble the pieces of a broken record, rotating the record around and filling each hole. Seemed easy enough. But when Jemma moves, every movable object on the same axis moves with her. So when I pushed in the last piece, another piece on the opposite side popped right out.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Shit.</em></p><p>A lot of the game’s puzzles start off just like that, easy right up until the end, when the curveball comes out of nowhere. But believe it or not, those moments felt good, too. With the record puzzle, once I saw that piece pop out, I started giggling. It was a feeling akin to putting your Crocs in “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/crocs-in-sport-mode">sport mode</a>.” This puzzle was harder than I expected, time to lock in. (And don’t worry, there are settings that let you skip puzzles if they’re too hard, settings to make puzzles harder, and a multiplayer mode that lets a friend move stuff, too.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Locked doors mean nothing to Jemma.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>Though <em>Arranger</em> is a puzzle game, it effectively uses its mechanics to build an interesting world and tell a sweet story. Jemma’s movement ability makes her unique, and she goes on an adventure to find others like her, using her powers for good along the way. When Jemma reaches the end of a row or column, she warps around to the other end. She uses that feature to bust out a teenager trapped in their locked room by strict parents by simply pushing them into the opposite wall. In another area, she saves a town whose inhabitants have become moribund in their homes because they relied too much on communicating via blue mechanical birds.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Ha!</em></p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the video game equivalent of a book you’d take with you on a beach vacation — perfect for your Switch, Steam Deck, or tablet. It’s pleasantly short — I’m in the final area, and I’ve played around four to five hours total. If you’re adventurous, you can extend that playtime by completing the optional puzzles scattered throughout. I love this little game unlike anything I’ve played recently.</p><p>To really drive home how charmingly seductive <em>Arranger</em> is, let me leave you with a short story. It was 11PM on a weekday night. I decided to play some <em>Arranger</em> before heading to bed — nothing more than 30–45 minutes tops. When I put down my Switch to check the time, it was 1:51AM. <em>Two hours</em> had passed and I didn’t even feel it. Moreover, I didn’t care. A game hasn’t done that to me, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom">even ones I’ve adored</a>, in recent or distant memory. I felt like a kid again. Give <em>Arranger</em> the chance to do that to you.</p><p><small><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em> is out now on Switch, PlayStation, PC, and mobile via Netflix.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/remnant-ii-final-dlc-the-dark-horizon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been an entire year since Remnant II was released, launching worldwide to a fairly positive reception and decent reviews. It’s a great game if you want to experience some mindless, visceral action, facing off against immense and at times grotesque bosses either alone or with friends. There’s also a decent story sitting at the heart of the game, along with some RPG elements and a pretty good loot loop to pursue.</p>



<p>Now that the game’s first anniversary has rolled around, the team at Gunfire Games has announced the impending arrival of the title’s third and final DLC: The Dark Horizon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expansive-dlc">‘The Most Expansive DLC’</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been a bad run for Remnant II, and a year is long enough for players to have soaked up everything the game has to offer. In September 2024, the game’s final DLC will be deployed – The Dark Horizon. It has been penned as the largest DLC the team has created thus far, but Gunfire Games admitted that it has been delayed by a few weeks. The original intention was to have all three DLCs released <strong>inside </strong>of one year.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team said in a statement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is for The Dark Horizon to be the most expansive DLC for Remnant II. Not only have we packed this DLC full of even more of the Remnant greatness you’ve come to expect, we’re also hard at work on a brand-new game mode that will be free for everyone that we’ll reveal soon along with a new progression system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘brand-new game mode’ is being kept under wraps for now, but it’s likely the most considerable addition to the game that’ll be ushered in with The Dark Horizon. The team didn’t confirm a date for the release of The Dark Horizon, but given that the window is September, there won’t be all that long to wait.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We are currently enjoying a golden age of fighting games. The latest in long-running series like Street Fighter, Tekken, and Guilty Gear are fantastic. Both newer (Dragon Ball FighterZ) and older games (Street Fighter 3rd Strike, Guilty Gear +R) are getting updates that add rollback netcode, enabling fans to enjoy the best player-to-player connections possible. And many new games are also being ported to nearly every platform, so it's easier than ever to play what you want, with who you want, when you want.</p><p dir="ltr">Some games have long been neglected and rendered unplayable on modern hardware, causing members of the fighting game community to call for developers to re-release or update them to be more accessible. Streamer Maximilian Dood's #FreeMVC2 movement is perhaps the most notable of these and, thankfully, this particular situation is about to be rectified. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes is coming back, ensuring the granddaddy of tag fighters will find a place in the hearts of brand-new fighting game players, not just the old heads.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The game is being released as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade/" data-ref-id="5000-632916" data-mce-href="/games/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade/">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>, which also includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, and The Punisher.</p><p dir="ltr">I dabbled in MvC3 and have played thousands of hours of Dragon Ball FighterZ, a spiritual successor to MvC, but growing up, none of my local arcades (or friends' houses) had Marvel Vs. Capcom, so my access was limited. I was curious to see how these older games held up for someone like me, who has little nostalgia for them, but my fears were laid to rest when I started playing through each one. I spoke to MvC Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics producer Shuhei Matsumoto after playing, and he confirmed that newer players like me are a key part of the collection's target audience.</p><p dir="ltr">The preview build I played at Evo granted access to three games from the collection; X-Men: Children of the Atom, X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. So how do these games from 1994 to 2000 hold up? Quite well it seems. These games don't have the level of polish when it comes to balance in comparison to newer games, where players can expect most of the roster to be competitively viable and roughly equivalent in power, but the MvC games themselves have character and style in spades, and are still incredibly fun to play. And that sense of wildly unbalanced gameplay is part of its charm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341209"></a><figcaption>All the games in the collection are faithful recreations of the original arcade games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Fluid and responsive controls match the gorgeous sprite-based graphics in MvC2, and it's fast and easy to jump from one part of the collection to another. Games like X-Men: Children of the Atom and X-Men Vs. Street Fighter are slightly less chaotic, but attacks are still chunky and fun and movement is pretty dynamic. Characters are diverse in how they play, which is appropriate given the varied powers of the X-Men characters, and the fighting styles of the Street Fighter roster.</p><p dir="ltr">I played Iceman in Children of the Atom, and it was a blast calling down massive boulders of ice on opponents. Cyclops can shoot his optic blasts across the screen, and Storm can summon small whirlwinds and lightning, keeping enemies on their toes. Street Fighter characters generally play similarly to their Street Fighter 3 versions, with some notable differences. Ken's grounded fireball doesn't go fullscreen in every game, but much like Akuma in the mainline games, X:Men Vs. Street Fighter's Ken and Ryu can throw fireballs in the air, with Ryu's going straight ahead, and Ken's moving downwards at an angle.</p><p dir="ltr">For newer players, I recommend starting with X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, and Matsumoto-san recommends jumping into the similar Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter, or MvC2. Marvel Vs. Street Fighter is more focused, with a smaller roster and fewer things to think about, so players who have never tried any fighting games but the 1v1 ones (Street Fighter, Tekken, most Mortal Kombat games, etc.) would likely do better starting there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341211"></a><figcaption>You can't go wrong with Spider-Man.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although the collection is releasing this year, Matsumoto-san said the team has been working with Marvel for three or four years to figure out when a collection like this could be released for modern platforms to bring it to new audiences. As the collection's title suggests, each game is a port of its arcade version. Matsumoto-san said the team thought very carefully about which versions to include, focusing on ones that were the most beloved by fans. I'm also pleased to say that, instead of being a simple port, this collection is robust and the team has included quite a few quality of life improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game has a special menu you can access before you launch, for example, letting you adjust settings on everything from arcade screen scan lines to aspect ratios, and use or hide different sidebar art. Accessibility options have been added, too, including single player difficulties, flashing light reduction, the ability to change which coin mode you use, secret character and hidden color toggles. One-button supers are also available for people who want to jump in and start beating up their friends without learning standard inputs, or lack the physical dexterity to do so. Quick save and quick load functions also mean you can stop playing and pick back up where you left off.</p><p dir="ltr">A training mode is also available, and while it isn't as robust as the one in Street Fighter 6 (a high bar to clear, to be sure), it does have startup information for moves, hitboxes, hurtboxes, and input readouts, making it much easier to get started and work out new combos and situations. You can also go into training mode with two players, which is nice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341212"></a><figcaption>Years later, it's still funny seeing Hulk get tossed around like a rag doll.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Some other changes have been made to better align the content of the game with modern day standards. Matsumoto-san said the team modified certain parts of the game which would impact the rating, such as altering "expressions or content that may not be appropriate for modern times." But game balance and gameplay elements are "faithfully reproduced for modern platforms."</p><p dir="ltr">Much like other Capcom collections, (such as the Mega Man Legacy Collection) Matsumoto-san confirmed the Marvel Vs. Capcom Collection includes "a gallery where you can check out some of the design documentation from when those original games were being made, past promotional illustrations and music." A music player will allow players to listen to the soundtrack of each of the games, and legacy art and assets are included, too.</p><p dir="ltr">I wasn't able to try out the online play, so I can't say how the netcode will stand up yet, but if Capcom's previous work on Street Fighter 6 is any indication, we're in for a buttery smooth online experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341213"></a><figcaption>So many of the mechanics and features that are popular in tag-team fighters today were popularized in MvC games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So what does this collection mean for the future of Marvel Vs. Capcom? Well, if the collection sells well, we may see another new Marvel Vs. Capcom game. I asked Matsumoto-san what he would do with that opportunity, whether he had an idea for what new characters he would want to include, and which gameplay elements they would add or subtract from previous entries. He said, "The hardest thing to decide on would definitely be the character choice, because you look at Marvel's roster now and there's a lot more characters now than there were back 20, 30 years ago. My impression of these MvC-type games is that it's almost like… ‘have fun, [be] cheerful, almost like a party,' with all these different characters and personalities and I think that aspect is something that's important to the series, and should be maintained."</p><p dir="ltr">"It also has to be fun for kids," he continued. "Kids gravitate towards their favorite superheroes, and they want to play with those superheroes. So given that opportunity, it's important to the series." This was certainly true for me. The first character I put on my MvC2 team was Spider-Man, my second favorite superhero ever. Coincidentally, the shirt I wore to the interview bore the symbol of my #1 superhero, Superman. Matsumoto-san laughed about it when I told him, saying "We probably wouldn't be able to include him," before going on to joke, "Guest character!" While we may never get Marvel Vs. Capcom Vs. DC (or Marvel Vs. Capcom Vs. DC Vs. Dragon Ball, as we joked about afterwards), the future's looking bright for this crossover fighting game series.</p><p dir="ltr">Player love for Marvel Vs/ Capcom has been strong for a long time, and lines were long to play the collection on the Evo show floor, showing the enthusiasm is still there. From my preview time, that love is shared by Capcom, which is putting a good foot forward with this (so far) high quality collection. With that in mind, I asked Matsumoto-san what he thought about the current state of fighting games, particularly considering newer games--like 2XKO and Dragon Ball FighterZ--clearly draw some inspiration from what Capcom had previously done with MvC. When I told him I felt we are in a new golden age, he said, "I definitely agree with your own impression" and that, with HunterXHunter and 2XKO, he hopes to see more people become interested in fighting games.</p><p dir="ltr">As far as I'm concerned, Matsumoto and the team at Capcom are doing their part by putting out this collection. I'm looking forward to playing more (and trying to convince all my friends to join me online) when it comes out later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/koei-tecmo-reveals-storyline-details-for-dynasty-warriors-origins/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Koei Tecmo has officially announced the first story line details for their new <a href="https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-brings-back-1v1k-action-in-2025/">upcoming action game</a> Dynasty Warriors: Origins. This game is slated for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Koei Tecmo has promised that this game will be the most jam-packed and intense action game out of any of the Warriors games already available on the market. Players engage in a 1 vs 1,000 action set in 183 AD.</p>
<p>This game introduces you to a heroic warrior who has to fight off waves of enemies on the battlefields of the ancient Three Kingdoms. The story takes place one year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion, where players are introduced to the protagonist suffering from amnesia and heading to a village suffering from famine.</p>
<p>In the village, the protagonist meets a man called Zhang Jiao, who is offering a helping hand to the people, and Guan Yu, who is denouncing the government officials. As a trio, they fight against the forces of corrupt powers, where the officials raise taxes, commit embezzlement, and find many ways to inflict suffering on the people in the villages.</p>
<p>This game features the largest number of soldiers in the series to date, with enemy soldiers attacking in cooperation to make a formidable opponent, give players a real sense of challenge, and force them to make tactical decisions to beat their opponent. While you control one person, you are responsible for an entire army, and you'll have to fight against thousands of enemies on the battlefield while utilizing your skills.</p>
<p>Certain battles will require you to meet specific conditions. While working on completing them, you can temporarily take control of Guan Yu and other companions that will accompany you on the battlefield. Players are given free roam in the game and the choice of where they want to go. They can choose which battlefield they want to go to next.</p>
<p>So that fans can see what to expect from Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the general producer Akihiro Suzuki has collaborated with producer Tomohiko Sho to produce a video that outlines their expectations for Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which can be watched<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPpGffZEkgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on YouTube</a>. However, the YouTube video is in Japanese, and no captions or translations are available. Although many people won't be able to understand what is being said in the video, the video does showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to see in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>

Which means you still have a great excuse to stay indoors where it’s cool and dark, and where electricity abundantly flows for us to power our gaming machines. </p><p>This weekend we’re taking a look at a few games that have come out in recent years, as well as a few more recent ones too. Whether you’re looking to jump into a colossal new galaxy, an epic Japanese gangster saga, or a DOS-game classic, we think these picks are well worth your time. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck: OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Not burning myself out on it</p><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899">finally picked up <em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span><em> </em>and I don’t want to put it down, but I’ve been forcing myself to. As enthralling as it is, and as much fun as I’m having in 1980s Japan, these games are far too easy to burn out on, and I think that’s why I’m always hesitant to go all in on them. I first played <em>Judgment </em>after a bad breakup, and proceeded to devote every mind-numbing minute of the next few weeks to that game. I was physically exhausted from planting my ass on the couch for hours on end. <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon </em>came out two months later, and I played it till I felt empty inside and couldn’t stomach it anymore. To this day, I still haven’t beaten it.</p><p>I wound up reviewing both <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden </em>and <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and while the former was a much more relaxed (and thankfully brief experience) the latter nearly burnt me out at the very start of the year. These games are immense and all-consuming, which is both great and terrifying depending on the light in which you’re looking at it. Despite it all, I love this series and I want to experience the rest of Kiryu’s story from the beginning, so here we are. I’m a few chapters in, and enjoying the meticulous pace at which I’m absorbing the game. It’s like tuning in for a new episode of my favorite show every few nights. Given that it’s the weekend though, I’m planning on marathoning a few more installments than usual, while trying to make sure it doesn’t do too much psychic damage, or deprive me of water, food, some sunlight, and time with friends. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Sun</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Complete the existing campaign </p><p>I’ve had a hard time putting <em>Cataclismo</em> down and even when I do I’m still thinking about it.

It’s in Early Access and rough around the edges still—lots of missing quality of life features and some annoying bugs—but the bones are there and fantastic. You build towering defenses during the day and survive onslaughts of horrors at night. The aesthetic feels a bit like water color <em>Gormenghast</em> fan art, and the mood is post-apocalyptic gothic punk. One of the nicest features is that there are automatic time anchors at regular intervals. If you lose, the game makes it easy to navigate back to previous points in a match to fix your mistakes and chart a different course. It’s not quite save-scumming and it’s a big time saver. If you like building thick stone walls and ridiculously precarious medieval shanty towns, this is the game for you. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get past the fourth stage</p><p>When <em>Void Bastards</em> came out in 2019, I was super excited to play it, and then for reasons I’m not quite clear on, bounced off hard. However, this week I was playing a preview build of its spiritual successor, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and went back to the first to see how much overlap there is between the two roguelite shooters.</p><p>It turns out, apart from the wonderfully distinctive art-style, not a huge number. Both are games where you need to progress along <em>Slay The Spire</em>-style pathways, completing FPS challenges and gathering resources. But after that, they really have a distinct feel. <em>Void Bastards</em> is about exploring spaceships to steal useful items, and shoot the violent residents, desperately trying to return to your airlock before you run out of air or blood.</p><p>Replaying it this time, however, I’m totally in love. I accidentally stayed up playing until 1am last night. I’m planning to play it this weekend too. And maybe forever. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-recommend-id="image://7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Koei Tecmo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-recommend-id="image://7846c0949f2a711dab49f5777cfd6ae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="928" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks out at a class room with options for a lesson plan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Enjoy one of the best Switch games to date (and have tea with Edelgard)</p><p>Did you know that today (July 26) is the five year anniversary of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a></span> releasing for Nintendo Switch? That’s as good as a reason as any to go play one of the best tactical RPGs ever made. If you’ve played it before or if you’ve never touched a<em> Fire Emblem</em> game in your life, you should still probably play some of <em>Three Houses</em> this weekend in celebration. </p><p><br><em>Three Houses</em> puts you in the shoes of a professor at the Garreg Mach Monastery officer’s school, and gives you the choice of which of the titular three houses to control. Each house has a charismatic leader and a loveable cast of students. Over the course of the game, through both tactical combat and laid-back tea breaks at the school, you get to build bonds with the game’s wonderfully written characters. The tactical combat also delivers. It’s pretty standard tactical fare but it’s executed well—it’s never overtly punishing or too easy. As we near the end of the Switch’s lifespan, <em>Three Houses</em> remains one of the best games the console has given us. — Willa Rowe  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-recommend-id="image://3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="790" data-height="444" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Origin Systems</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-recommend-id="image://3fe1be996780b21a79e39c9e341188a4" data-format="jpg" data-width="790" data-height="444" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a beholder in a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PC (Available on GOG)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Finally beat it after over 30 years</p><p>Each summer, the big online PC storefronts offer colossal sales that have thousands of gamers flocking to buy titles for 75 or 90 percent off, deals so good we can’t pass them up, even though, if we’re honest with ourselves, we may never get around to playing half of the games we buy in our mad shopping frenzy. And this year, it wasn’t Steam’s legendary summer sale that had me lusting to expand my library, but the one over at GOG.com. For whatever reason, lately I’ve been feeling the itch to experience older PC classics I missed out on when they first released, or to return to ones I never finished, and so this summer saw my GOG library expand to the tune of dozens of games, all picked up on the cheap. </p><p>And right now, the game in my GOG library that’s calling to me like no other is <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, the absolutely remarkable 1992 first-person role-playing game that made you feel immersed in its environments like no game had before. Considered by some the first example of an immersive sim, <em>Ultima Underworld </em>has had a level of influence and impact on the medium that few games can match. And although, of course, by today’s standards it all looks and feels pretty basic, for me there’s something really compelling about it all—the charm of its interface, with that gargoyle sneering over the gameplay window; the way the jagged, pixel-y graphics just make the stones of the dungeon look that more rough-hewn; the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sound Blaster</a></span>-ass music, which adapts on the fly to the kind of situation you’re in.

Though I appreciated and didn’t mind the state the game shipped in in 2016, a busy life kept me from sinking any meaningfully sustained time into this near-endless virtual galaxy. And then with all the updates, it just seemed impossible to know when to jump in for any meaningful amount of time. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-patch-5-0-free-helldivers-mechs-1851596276"><em>No Man’s Sky </em>Is Getting A Complete Universal Refresh In One Of Its Biggest Updates Ever</a></span></p><p>But both as a consequence of the recent improvements by way of Worlds Part I and the massive backlog of material I have to discover after so many free updates, <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is a massive, make-your-own-fun kind of sandbox that I just can’t resist. So this weekend will likely see me continue my efforts to keep building up my base and exploring the planets in the system I’m presently sticking to until it feels appropriate to move on. </p><p>I have to stress though how much I love the core foundation of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>: simply traveling and scouting, seamlessly flying from world to world, taking in new horizons, finding all sorts of emergent opportunities. It’s wonderful. The scale of this world also just makes me feel so small (especially in VR) and instills that joyous sense of wonder that I get from watching vintage <em>Cosmos</em> while, um, well. Under the influence of. Uh. stuff. And though I do wish the graphics were a touch more photorealistic, I’ve learned to love <em>NMS</em>’ cartoony, overly colorful look, especially on a vibrant screen where the very red grass of the planet I’ve been covering every inch of just pops with life. </p><p><br>Does the game still feel a little hollow in some ways? Sure. Could it have More To Do™, sure. (Past Expeditions, actually, <em>should</em> still be available to play). But ya’ll, just vibing in digital spaces is a valid way to enjoy one’s time. I don’t need to be chewing through content all the goddamn time. I like that <em>NMS</em> exists as a refuge for that. — Claire Jackson  </p><hr><p>And that wraps up our picks for this weekend.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Date Everything | Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The game features 100 dateable everyday objects, each of which are brought to life by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">(human) voice actor</a>. The voice cast includes quite a few well-known names, including Johnny Young Bosch, Felicia Day, Grey DeLisle, and more. Each romance has three different outcomes--the player can become the object's lover, their friend, or even their mortal enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">The 3D overworld changes as the game progresses, and according to Sassy Chap devs, these changes are based on the player's in-game decisions, suggesting some objects may not be so eager to serve their original purpose if the player burns them romantically. It's not hard to imagine the intense (and incredibly inconvenient) consequences of experiencing a bitter breakup with your refrigerator, and it's likely that hell hath no fury like a toaster scorned.</p><p dir="ltr">Date Everything also features:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Over four hours of original music, with each dateable item featuring a unique musical theme</li><li dir="ltr">1.2 million words and 70,000 lines of voiced dialogue</li><li dir="ltr">Over 11,000 hand-drawn images</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sassy Chap Games has yet to announce a release date for the game, but we do know that upon release, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
